The seventh, and by Okin’s calculations, final day of travel was by far the most arduous.  Even the pure bred Trentanian horses, who needed less rest as they could feed off the sun, were growing weary from continuous days of pulling the carriage and the two men inside it.

From his incessant complaining, one would believe that Gendro was in fact the one pulling the carriage.  Every time they passed by a town or village--- whether it was a bustling city or a couple of forestry lodges, Gendro would beg Okin to stop.  

*I’m getting tired of explaining to him how crucial this mission is,* Okin thought as they passed by a castle-fort, similar to Fort Isla, where Okin had met Gendro.  *I hear myself wishing that The Citadel would have assigned me a more conscientious  Rothar, but then again, maybe this is part of my test as a true High Ather.* 

The blistering sun bled across the endless dry plains, and a glistening reflection caught Okin’s eye.  The last water they had seen was from the massive Exigence Lake--- and flat Nairfalk wasn’t exactly a sight to behold.  The river rushed across the latitudinal horizon, and there was no end in sight from the east to the west.  

On top of the river sat a cozy town, and Okin knew Gendro’s request before it left his lips.

“Here.  We must stop here.  We’re almost there, it won’t change anything if we stop here.  It’s barely noon--- we’ll still get to The Citadel before nightfall, before the gates close.”

“No, we’re just about to cross the Barrackus River.  We’re almost there, Gendro, we’re almost there.  We can’t stop now.”

“You’re not the one that has to do the riding, Okin,” Gendro said.  “You can sit there and doze off--- I have to keep my *eyes* on the *road*.”

Okin scoffed.  “First of all, it is custom for a Rothar to drive his Ather from place to place, and second, I actually have taken the reins for half the distance as *you* slept.”

“I know, I’m just teasing with you, Okin,” Gendro laughed.  “It’s just no Ather with a shred of sanity would travel for fourteen hours straight for six days.  Why did I have to be assigned to the one crazy one?”

“For one who dedicates himself to Nexon, you are quite unadventurous,” Okin smirked.

“For one who tries to act double his age,” Gendro said, mimicking Okin’s voice.  “You are just... a wild maniac.”

The carriage passed through the town, crossing a curved wooden bridge over the Barrackus River.  There weren’t many people around, but a few sellers with small stands, selling food and water to travelers.

“Stop,” Okin said as they crossed the bridge to the other side of town.  Gendro turned, shocked, but did as commanded and slowed the horses.  From atop the cart, Okin shouted down to a bearded old man who stood behind a market stand.  

“How much for a loaf of bread and a cup of water?”  Okin asked.  

“Seven steltells, High Ather,” the man replied.

Okin smiled.  Even many religious men didn’t recognize the difference between the robes of an Ather and a High Ather, or didn’t have the respect to use the full title.

Stepping down from the passenger’s seat, Okin took seven nickel steltells from his coin pouch, which was deeper within his satchel.  “Here you go, kind sir,” he said, handing them to the merchant.

He smiled, and in return gave Okin a loaf of bread and a metal cup of water.  “Please drink, and then return it to me,” the man said.  

Okin nodded, but after taking the cup reached up and handed it to Gendro, along with the bread.  “Drink up,” he said.

Wide-eyed, Gendro smiled before chugging the water down.  With a sigh of relief, he handed the empty cup back to Okin, who in turn handed it back to the merchant.

“Thank you,” Okin said, before stepping back onto the carriage.

“You stopped just to get me something?  You’re not going to have anything yourself?”  Gendro asked.

“You were bellyaching, so I filled your belly.  I do not require anything, no, I do not want anything, not until we reach The Citadel,” Okin said.  “Would you like me to take the reins as you eat your bread?”

Gendro grinned, and handed Okin the strap.  The carriage pushed forward, leaving the small town behind.
