This ‘Einwa’ was built inside, not into, the mountain. Rather than being a series of tunnels dug through the mountain, the ‘city’ was centred around a central shaft which was almost a kilometre wide. The entrance Avador had opened had led onto a stone walkway, which lined the outer rim of the mountain in a ring fashion. There were dozens of these rings, growing smaller and smaller until the tip of the mountain, each speckled with doors and lamps. 

Tentatively, Billy grabbed a hold of the railing and leaned over the side of the outer walkway. It was when he looked down over the side that he truly took in the scale of the structure. Below, the mountain extended down into a vast cavern. Held up by earthwork pillars \[ 2021-02-16, 5:22 PM

What are earthwork pillars?\]at regular intervals the cavern expanded far beyond what Billy could see. He could only take in the sea of flickering lamps below.

To his side, Damian had done the same, and was visibly shocked. *So much for keeping out wits about us*, he thought. 

“Billy, this is---“

“Amazing, isn’t it?” Allia said. The girl made her way behind Billy to lean on the railing next to Damian. “This is just the first of the six mountains that we are gifted in using. You will have plenty of time to take in the view, as this is one of the two we use for housing. But onto Banuro first.” 

“So, what are we gonna do in this Ba-nu-ro?” Billy said.

“Speak to the Dakungs, see if they’ll accept you.” Avador leaned his back agains the rail, throwing his head to look up. 

“And who are they?”Billy asked 

“Don’t speak Delmian?” Avador leaned forward.

Billy shook his head in response. Why would a young Wreathwardian-looking guy with Apathasawian boots speak *Delmian?*

“Means lord. They run the place kid, anything you want they can get it for you, and you want to do anything? It’ll go through them at some point.” Avador pointed his finger upwards, toward the roof of the cavernous opening. “They spend most their time up there, ya see. So we gonna find ‘em\[ 2021-04-10, 10:40 AM

Not sure if avador’s speech quirks are consistent with later chapters\] and see what they think of you three.” 

Billy clenched his teeth, curling his fist. Of course, there would be manipulative authorities here. Allia and Avador were just the mid-level sycophants who supported their corruption. It was just like Wreathward. And of course, like before, he was in *their* domain, so he couldn’t stop it.

To his right, Allia sighed, and the girl frowned at Avador. At least someone here was giving him some clear answers.

“So they no like us, we cinked?” Benjamin said. 

Allia and Avador nodded silently. “However, that will not happen. I won’t allow it.” Allia turned to face the three, and Billy was stricken by the sense of fatality that surrounded her. Her expression carried a grim air to it, as if formed of harsh stone. The roundness of her face pulled taught to bring out sharp angles. \[ 2021-04-10, 10:41 AM

Body language is good but delivery feels a little weird\]

“Yeah, if they don’t like you then you’re in the hole,” Avador pushed himself off the railing. “Let’s go then? They’ll make you wait, so ain’t no sense in stalling.” 

“I suppose,” Allia said. 

“Wait, so why did we come into this one if we’re supposed to be going to Banuro?” Damian asked. The youth gripped the railing tight, peering high above him as they walked up the stony steps.

“Oh, you’re in for a treat kid,” Avador let out hearty chuckle before pointing towards the stone column at the centre of the open shaft, where the spiral staircase was leading towards. 

Avador walked forward on a connecting walkway to the centre of the mountain, and the group followed, finding a long, enclosed spiral staircase that led both upward and downward. Was this the ‘treat’ that Avador had in mind?

“C’mon,” the older man said, motioning to the rest of the group. “We don’t have all day.”

Surprisingly, the walk wasn’t *too* tiring. The openings at every floor became more and more terrifying, though.

“Here we are now!” Avador shouted. Billy was last in line, just behind Damian, and so he was the last one to step up into the strange room. 

Beginning right where the staircase ended, engravings of scenes that Billy didn’t recognize snaked through the stone. Some depicted battles, while other depicted scenes like a ship sailing into the distance, or a model of their solar system. Inside the room were four circular areas, fenced off by a metal railing. Each area sat in-between two of the equally spaced entrances, which gave the room a comforting symmetry. 

Within the two fenced areas, the floor was made up of a glossy white material, as opposed to the grey stone which composed the rest of the columned staircase leading up to this place, and the room itself.

Billy froze. The ‘room’ only had two circular walls and a roof, like an incomplete cave with two entrances. Like the other floors, it had a connecting platform that stretched to either side of the circular rings. This platform was much different though; it was much thicker, and at its end was a wide hole in the mountain, giving a nice view of the cloud bed just below, and the mountain ahead. 

“Welcome to The Well,” Avador held his hands apart, slowly spinning as he entered the centre of the room. “This is what connects everything on *Tehwa Kanura* . You wanna get anywhere, you go through here.” 

“And how exactly do we get anywhere?” Billy said.

Avador smiled, then pointed out the opening, off to the mountain in the distance.

“We fly, kid.”

“Fly?” Damian said excitedly. The teen hurried to Billy side, stumbling over himself. “We get to fly?” 

“That you do kid,” Avador turned to face the right most fenced area, the one that had that strange glossy flooring. “Here, I’ll show ya.” 

Avador flashed them a smile before gesturing to the blonde girl, Evelyn.

“Evelyn? I’ve talked enough, but this is your show.”

“The first time is always the most fun,” Evelyn winked before sauntering back towards the railing which create the fenced off area. She ran her hand along the railing before deftly jumping it. 

Allia took a few extra steps, before pushing open a small gate. Damian and Benjamin both followed Allia, while Billy elected to hop the fence after Evelyn’s example.

“Forces gift me, at the least one of you isn’t exceedingly dull.” Allia shot Evelyn a glare at the comment, and the taller girl shrugged. Were Avador and Evelyn the odd ones out for being so lax, or was Allia simply an uptight snob, even amongst her own people?

Billy reluctantly stepped onto the glossy white disk. A collection of handholds rose out of the surface, with a large gridlike construction rising about a meter up in the centre. In total the disc couldn’t have been larger than three metres in diameter.

Both Avador and Allia had sat down and were each holing one of the handholds. “It would be best if you sit. I would rather not have to deal with any accidents today.” 

Evelyn gestured to a handhold, and Billy sat, gripping the smooth outcropping. Damian followed. Benjamin, waited a moment longer before finally following his friends.

“What is this?” with a free hand Benjamin pointed to the glossy white surface they were sitting on.

“That is for me to know, and for you to find out. Everyone holding on tight?” 

“I detest this,” Allia said quietly as the girl shut her eyes tight, her knuckles whitening. 

“I shall take that as confirmation. To Banuro we go then,” Evelyn turned her eyes to look through the opening which bled light into the mountain. She inhaled deeply, splaying her fingers out to the mountain in the distance, and under Billy the glossy white surface began to rumble. A low tone rung out and the previously white surface began to glow as if surrounded by a deep violent gel. The platform hovered upwards.

They shot out of the mountain, and Billy lurched forward. He was completely lost in the moment, and had no idea how fast they were moving. It was just a blur of fog and faces.

Though Billy’s body was stricken with panic, Benjamin was yelling out in excitement. The usually stoic man started cheering. With an arm held high above his bald head, his screams were almost lost to the wind. The whipping wind forced his body to acknowledge the inhuman way in which he was moving. The platform rose upwards in an arc, building up a pressure in his ear drums. For a moment, the scenery around him became a blur of browns and reds. Billy turned his head back; and another mountain grew smaller in the distance.

He was starting to stabilize, his palms white from clutching the handles. The other’s faces looked as hot as his felt. He turned his head to the left, they were approaching another mountain. The pressure mounted, the winds mounted, the disorientation mounted, till he slowed. The disc drifted through the crevice in the mountain, coming to a halt at a similar station to the one they departed from.

“That was great!” Benjamin scrambled to his feet running over to Evelyn. “This, can you teach?” 

Evelyn chuckled, waving him off. “Well, that’s dependant on the Dakungs. Perhaps, if you stay, we can make the proper arrangements.” 

Their two voices seemed muffled to Billy, as if they were speaking through thick cloths. 

“Open your jaw, kid,” Avador made a loud yawning motion, pointing to himself. \[ 2021-02-16, 5:38 PM

This is a great detail!\]Billy followed, and in an instant sound return to the world around him. “Always a little strange the first time, Forces damn me but I hated this the first time. Still do, not as much as she does though.” 

Avador jerked his head to the side, where Damian was helping a shaky Allia to her feet. The girl really did fail to have any consistency to her. She was fearless and powerful in combat, but ever so shy and coy in conversation. Everyone had an angle, he just had to find hers. 

“Well, I wish you all great luck. However, I would prefer to not step foot in that chamber.” Evelyn held out a lanky finger towards a set of wooden double doors at the end of the large hallway.

“I would too, but I gotta go and explain that the kid made me take her,” Avador crossed his right arm to the right shoulder in a salute towards Evelyn. The woman returned the salute. 

“Come on kids, let’s get this over with. Maybe they’ll even give me the day off, only the Forces know.” Avador turned on his heel and began to stride down the corridor. Allia followed quickly after with Damian on her tail. Billy followed after as Benjamin stared at the platform they had been flown up on. 

Billy stepped back and tugged on his friend’s shirt, and Benjamin turned with a grunt. “Amazing. Never thought I see technique like that. So much power, majesty.” 

“The platform?” Billy asked his friend.

Benjamin nodded his bald head in reply, “Yes. Amazing. I never think someone can do thing like this. That much power.” 

“Yeah, it’s terrifying,” Billy said.

His friend shook his head vehemently, “Not terrifying, amazing.” 

*Same difference,* Billy thought to himself, but he knew there was no use arguing. Benjamin had his mind made up, and it wasn’t often one could change that. 

The double wooden doors were engraved with similar patterns to the ones Billy had seen earlier. Avador pulled a large iron ring off the door and let it down in a resonant *thump* sound. The doors parted to reveal a circular antechamber with a significantly lower roof than the main hallway. A man stood in the door way, flanked by two other men in padded armour; which was of a Marthian style, with padded sheets strung together in larger sections to cover the body, yet remain light. 

“Chowondo Avador? Kadonsong Allia?” The central man was dressed like Avador and Evelyn had been, with his outfit being dyed a deep black with gold trim and gold knotted belt. He was a short man, with a rounded face and bald head. His eyes bulged at seeing the two, yet his voice remainded calm. 

“I see you brought candidates?” The man leaned past Avador to look the three over. “These seem acceptable. A halfway decent haul for a woman of your reputation.”

“So, may I see the Dakungs? I require their immediate evaluation.”  Allia stepped infront of Avador.

The short man stroked his chin, “The Dakungs cannot all be bothered by an evaluation of new recruits, Allia. You know this. I may request your own Dakung, if you wish.” 

Allia sighed, slumping her shoulders. Surprisingly, Avador gave her a look of pity rather than one of pride.

“Yes, okay, please summon Dakung Taedon. Thank you,” Allia said.

Allia gave the man a slight bow, shallower than the one she had given Avador. 

The short man nodded to his fellow guards, and then opened the door and slipped inside. A little while later, he returned, holding the door open for a tall, bare-chested man followed by a thin, pale-faced woman.

“Ah, it is true,” the bare-chested man said, narrowing stark grey eyebrows. “You have returned.”
