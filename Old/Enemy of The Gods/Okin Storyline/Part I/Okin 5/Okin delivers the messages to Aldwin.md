“...and then I came to you, to The Citadel, as fast as I could.”

Aldwin scratched his chin and his eyes stared at the floor. Okin had just finished relaying the story of Billy’s arrest, trial, and eventual escape, without sparing a single detail.  

Aldwin’s furry grey eyebrows finally returned to Okin, and his lips creased into the kind smile Okin had known since childhood. “Thank you for telling me all this,” Aldwin said. “I will alert the Devinars, though it may take some time with their whereabouts unknown.”

“The townspeople claimed they saw him escape on a flying ship, heading over the Sethenin Ocean,” Okin said. “I know, he’s so different now, but I knew it was them, and I just couldn’t believe my eyes. It was Billy, Impalias, it was Billy!”

“He’s not the boy we knew,” Aldwin’s eyes drifted off again. “We’ll get him, Okin. We’ll find him and bring him to Justice.”

Okin’s lips quivered, and his gaze drew away from Aldwin’s empty face; both men sat inches from each other, eyes set deep into the ornate furniture of Aldwin’s dining room. But neither scrutinized the beautiful wares.

“Do you think...,” Okin said. “What if Billy was right?”

Aldwin fidgeted in his seat, and his chair squeaked against the floor. “What do you mean? He’s a murderer... he betrayed his own father! How could he be right in any regard?”

“I mean,” Okin searched the crinkles of his mentor’s face. “What if the Synodontis really did kill his father?”

Aldwin’s mouth hung agape. “That’s just a nonsense excuse from a desperate criminal. You were presented with the evidence, as were the others, and you found him guilty, did you not?”

Okin head hung to the floor. “Well, actually, the other two Athers reached a consensus. I did not make a decision.”

“Well, no matter,” Aldwin shook his head. “It is a... *terrible* fact to accept--- I too remember smiling at you playing together as children, and preaching to the boy,” Aldwin looked away; tears were forming in his eyes. “But Billy *is* guilty. And I will make sure he is brought to Justice for murdering one of the greatest men I ever knew.” Aldwin looked down and blotted his eyes. 

“I...I apologize, Impalias Aldwin,” Okin looked down in shame.

“No,” Aldwin shooed a hand as to dismiss the apology. “I am the one who should apologize for losing my composure.”

Okin smiled, and opened his mouth to speak, but he was interrupted by Aldwin.

“It is good that you are here, anyway. I have something important I’d like you to help me with.”

Okin raised an eyebrow, though inside, he felt a little...unsatisfied. Would he ever come face-to-face with Billy again? Would he ever see the product of Justice?

“Previa, come down here!” Aldwin shouted upwards.

“Coming!” There was some rustling up above, and soon loud footsteps thundered down the stairs. A bright-eyed Previa entered the living room, dark brown hair combed back to show his youthful face. Instead of the proper Ather robes, the man wore a fashionable red coat, with slightly over sized cuffs which folded back over. Paired with a pair of dark brown pants, the man seemed quite well put together, if not a little flamboyant.

“Okin! What are you doing here?” 

Okin’s eyes widened. “I---“

“We had some things to discuss,” Aldwin interrupted. The Impalias leaned back in his seat, and held out a wrinkly hand to his son. “But there are more important matters at hand now. Previa, why don’t you tell Okin what we’ve been discussing.”

Previa’s eyes widened. “Oh yes. Father has--- Father and I have decided that I am to run as Impalias in the upcoming election for lower Whenran.”

Okin’s jaw dropped. *Previa? Run for Impalias? What had gotten into Aldwin?* *Previa is the last Ather in Whenran who should be elected as an Impalias!*

Okin turned to Aldwin, who leaned back in his chair with a proud smile. 

Okin had trouble getting his lips open. “Impalias Aldwin, don’t you---“

“You have always been a great mentor to my son and he will need your counsel now more than ever,” Aldwin interrupted him. “I will continue to do all I can to help, but I am as busy as ever. I trust that you will continue to guide him so he is the best candidate one can be.”

“I---,” now Okin had trouble closing his agape mouth as he glanced back and forth from Aldwin’s stern grey eyes to Previa’s excited emeralds. “Of course, Impalias Aldwin. Though, I will say---,“ Okin’s face scrunched as he met Previa’s, “I expect this to be an uphill battle. Previa will lack experience especially compared to the other candidates.” 

As expected, Previa’s childlike glimmer dimmed ever so slightly. Okin just avoided the pang of guilt by looking away.

“Well yes,” Aldwin nodded. “That’s exactly why he has the most honest Ather in all of Whenran, even all of *Wreathward* by his side.”

The light of youthful pride in Previa’s eyes returned, but now it was Okin’s face that gloomed, though he tried to hide it. His shame, the reminder of his perfect record being broken hung over him like a deathly cloud that would not flee.

“I am not the most honest Ather in all of Wreathward,” Okin bit his lip. “I withheld information from the guards, at the graveyard, remember, I---“

“Oh, yes,” Aldwin looked to Previa, and the young Ather also glanced between them with a look of confusion. “Y-you can always repent, though. In fact, the Arbiter of Truth is here, he would be the perfect man to go see,” Aldwin leaned forward in his chair and placed a wavering hand on Okin’s shoulder. “The Gods know we are not perfect, all they ask is that we try our best to be. You are *still* a paragon of Truth, my son.”

*But once a vase has been cracked, it can never really be the same, can it?* The thought fleeted from Okin’s mind, but he just returned the same kind smile of his elderly mentor with a slow nod.

“Good,” Aldwin patted his hand on Okin’s shoulder and smiled. “Now, I bet you’re tired from such an arduous journey, and Previa and I still have work to do. The visiting complex for Southern Whenranish clergy is on the northern corner of Rentar and Aredal. I can have Devinar Trasin escort you, if you wish.”

Okin shook his head and smiled as he got up from his seat. He nodded to Previa, holding back the still utter surprise from his face, and pushed in his chair as to leave the room.

He took a few steps before turning back. “Impalias Aldwin,” the elder man looked up at Okin. “If the Devinars ever catch Billy and bring him to Justice, may you please let me know?”

“Of course,” Aldwin nodded.

Okin gave a curt nod back and left Aldwin and Previa alone.
