As usual, the markets were bustling in the afternoon, even on this cloudy day. Commoners and clergy alike haggled for food and wares, and Okin even recognized some familiar faces, Athers he knew from Central Whetland, near Ariska, taking out money and putting back things into their own satchels.

He had the urge to say hello, but of course that would subvert his disguise, which was both soothing in its security and uncomfortable by its bulk, and by the fact that Okin was pretending to be someone he wasn’t.  He avoided the main market square, moving around a large crowd on the main road, towards the residential street that would connect with the alley where the beggar always hid. 

A Devinar, stiff-backed and taking long strides, gave Okin a nod as he passed by. Okin tried to nod his head back, not entirely sure of whether the motion was actually clear through the solid helmet.

After passing, the Devinar quickly whipped around Okin’s back, and someone else spoke from behind. 

“We found him in the marketplace. Matched the description, and he tried to flee.”

Okin turned around to see the commotion. Speaking with the Devinar were two Rothars, dressed identical to himself, each holding one arm of a squirming Ather---with short brown hair and green eyes. His robes were white with golden accenting, denoting him as a Dedicant to Aredal.

“It’s not me! I don’t know who you’re talking about!” The Ather shouted.

The Devinar raised a gauntleted finger to the Ather’s chin, lifting it up and inspecting it. He then grabbed the Ather’s left palm, inspecting it.

“It isn’t him,” the Devinar said, and the two Rothars released the man, who gave both of them dirty looks. “Next time you find a suspect, check the palm. He only has Truth.”

The two Rothars nodded and saluted in unison.

Okin shook, sweat building from his already over-heated scalp. He quickly slipped into the alley before any of the men noticed him. The clanking of his boots grew louder as he rushed down the street quicker, turning into the desolate alley where the beggar always was.

The Citadel had probably hunted the beggar, a former Ather, for some time, but the man looked so old now. Where there really still people looking for him, like there were men looking for Okin now? 

Okin shivered as he considered the prospect of the rest of his life becoming like the beggar’s. It seemed more and more likely by the day.

The little crevice underneath the rooftops of the two desolate houses, where the beggar normally stayed, looked empty besides the blankets; the man was likely in his strange little bunker. 

Okin kicked aside the vagabond’s torn, dirty blankets, which revealed the pot cover.

He stomped on it. There was no response.

He did three more loud, distinct stomps. Still, no response.

Finally, he leaned down and shouted into the pothole.

“Hello! I am here, it’s Okin! I have crucial information to share with you!”

Nothing. 

Okin grunted, and resorted to a succession of violent stomps.

“Why are you ruining my door like that?”

Okin jumped around in a semicircle, nearly falling down due to the weight of his armour. He held up his fist clumsily.

“Woah, woah, no need to be afraid. It’s just old me. Please pull up the mask, I haven’t exactly memorized your voice, but I’m quite certain it is you. I haven’t given anyone else directions here in ages,” the vagabond laughed. He had somehow snuck up behind Okin from the alleyway. What could he have been doing out of his little hole? Begging on a more populated street?

“I have found something that might be of interest of you,” Okin said, in between gradually slowing breaths. “*But---*I ask for information in return.”

“What would you like to know?” The beggar asked, smiling.

“First off--- how old are you? How long have you been... hiding?”

“Longer than you can imagine,” the beggar laughed.

Okin rolled his eyes, inching closer. “For real. How long have you been doing---*this*. Hiding out here, investigating The Citadel.”

The beggar raised a chin to his beard. “I suspect...you are afraid that you will become like me and have to live in this... *unfortunate* situation?”

Okin stepped back, blushing. “Well, uhm, yes.”

The vagabond let out another hearty laugh, placing a hairy hand on Okin’s plated shoulder. 

“Trust me, friend, I have other reasons for hiding. Soon enough, this will all be over for you, and you can go back to being an ordinary Ather. No hiding,” the vagrant’s normally repulsive smile was rather comforting. “Now, let’s see what you got.”

Part of him wanted to ask more questions, but Okin felt like obliging. He reached into his satchel for the crystal, and the vagrant released the hand from his shoulder, instead reaching out his hand to inspect it.

Okin pulled away.

“Before you see it, I have a few more inquiries.”

The beggar sighed, rolling his eyes. “What is it?”

“You’ve obviously been at this a long time. What have you discovered that you haven’t told me? Why are they doing this? What do they want?” Okin asked, clutching the crystal with both arms, shying it away from the beggar who still continued to reach for it.

“All I know is that they control The Citadel, and they’ve changed some of its doctrine over the years,” the vagabond replied, extending his arm closer. “I’ve only found out their leadership just now, through you.”

“Why though? And why *have* you been hiding all these years?” Okin asked.

“I’ve told you all I know,” the beggar growled, and he lurched forward, grabbing Okin’s hand, tugging on it. “Let me see it!”

Okin yanked his arm away, squeezing the crystal tight enough so the beggar wouldn’t even get a finger on it. He would not be pushed around today, he would hide the crystal indefinitely until the man finally told him what he wanted to know. The turning of his large bulk sent the beggar stumbling backward.

The beggar raised both arms as if surrendering to Okin.

“I’m sorry, I get a little annoyed when people talk too much about my past,” the vagabond said. “I honestly told you most of what I know. I’ve done a lot of thinking and research, and I’ve only come to one conclusion based on their recent actions, but it isn’t even definite.”

Okin nodded, telling the beggar to continue. 

“I think,” the beggar scratched his beard. “I think they want to reignite the war on Farsun.”

Okin’s eyes widened. It made sense based on the election; Older scholars like Trenton were more opposed to reigniting the war, so they would have to get him unelected. But what goals would the war serve? 

“Why? What would that do?” Okin asked.

“I---there is one possible explanation, but I’m not sure if you’re ready to hear it,” the beggar said.

“What--- tell me!”

“I will, in time. I have told you enough for now, and I am afraid that more information will be too much for your conscious. Finding out about the corruption of men you saw as allies, men you looked up to, it must be devastating,” the beggar replied.

Okin sighed. He didn’t like being left in the dark, but honestly, the man was right. Okin wasn’t sure if he was ready to hear more. Okin held out his hand to the beggar to present the crystal.

“C’mon now,” the beggar grumbled.

“Look at it, its---“

Okin’s heart froze as he saw his empty palm.

“What? I swear, I had it in my hand all along!” He frantically dug in his satchel, checking the ground around him. The Space Crystal was nowhere to be found. 

“That is---,” the beggar stopped, checking around his feet. “What was it?”

“A Space Crystal, I think,” Okin said, scratching his chin. “Could its owner have---retrieved it using Heraldry?”

The vagabond shook his head, eyes widening. 

“Maybe, but I don’t think so,” he replied. “I do not know so much about Heraldry, but I think Teleportation Heralds require line of sight and can really only move themselves to things, not the other way.”

“Where could it have gone then?” Okin asked.

“Well, I have no clue,” the beggar replied.

Okin cleared his throat, leaning down and sweeping up the blankets on the floor just in case the crystal had fallen on them. It wasn’t there. 

“Anyways,” he said, sweat building under his armour, “I found it in Aldwin’s house, in the bedroom. I spoke with Previa, the boy still seems oblivious to what Aldwin and the cult are doing. I have no idea how they are going to make *him* become an Impalias. But besides that, what would Aldwin be doing with a Space Crystal?”

“Is it possible that he is a Space Herald?” The vagabond asked.

“I don’t think so. If he is, he’s kept it very well hidden, which is strange,” Okin replied.

The beggar nodded, his eyes piercing Okin’s.

“You’re sure, you had it in your hand the entire time?” 

“Yes,” Okin replied. “It was in my satchel, I took it out to show you, then we argued, and then it disappeared.”

The beggar looked away, his expression unreadable because of the massive, scruffy beard.

“Alright,” he said, turning back to Okin and patting him on the shoulder. “Thank you for coming to tell me, and be sure to come by if any other crucial information pops up, or if you need anything. I will always be here.”

Leaving the small, dark crevice, Okin stumbled back, retracing his steps, his armour weighing down more on his shoulders with every step. How was it that he now felt the safest in the beggar’s hovel, and a target everywhere else?

Looking up past the houses, his stomach sank. The circular walls of his new prison were likely the highest in the world.
