# The virus

The first Heralds are hit by the virus, they have no anti-bodies passed from food or parents so they fight the virus for longer making them stronger heralds.

Humans first get the virus from animals and it is spread slowly that way

# Types of Heralds

## Dark

## Light  (The Heraldry of Energy)

Absorb visible light, and covert it to other forms of energy

STAYING WITHIN ELECTROMAGNETIC IS EASIEST:

1. light to other UV, xrays, or Infrared (gives them all types of vision assist)
2. light to radar, fm, tv, short wave, am (can be used to detect things and send messages with technology. right now pretty useless.)
3. gamma rays (give someone cancer)

EASY CONVERSIONS, in order of ease

1. light to heat (heat wave, self-feeding (caloric))
2. light to sound (sound wave, blow out people's eardrums)
3. light to kinetic (shock wave, blow people back)
4. light to "electricity" (combination of the three above; electric wave)

HARD CONVERSIONS, in order of ease

1. light to potential (hit harder)
2. light to gravitational (gravity well)

Energy emitted is in wave form, and follows inverse square law

Light has two modes, *conduction* and *radial* that are toggled between

​	Conduction is more efficient, the energy will try to find a path to the ground. Energy is released from the user at all points touching 	the ground

​	Radial is less efficient. Energy is released at all points along a person
