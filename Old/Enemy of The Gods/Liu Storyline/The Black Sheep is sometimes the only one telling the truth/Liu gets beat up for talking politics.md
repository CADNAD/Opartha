“Liu, this is just excellent,” Iago said, smiling at the sheet. “I’ve always struggled with these numbers---I’m almost certain that the inspector had overlooked some of my past errors--- but not only have you given me confidence in the accounting, I’m also quite proud about our earning improvements, thanks to you.”

Liu gave a short nod. “Thank you, Mr. Iago.”

Iago placed an arm on Liu’s shoulder, the wrinkles in the corner of his eyes creased even more as he gave his usual endearing smile. “Your father--- he would be proud.”

Looking away from Iago and to the floor, Liu said nothing. The weight of Iago’s hand slid off his shoulder.

“Oh yes,” Liu’s eyes perked back up. “I almost forgot, I was doing some research on optimal watering schedules for the different crops, and was going to inform the new Sprinkler about which crops he should water, and when.”

Iago smiled again. “If the other farmhands did half the work you did, we could start our *own* empire,” he said. 

*Not even close. We don’t nearly have an established political structure, nor a standing military, or the numerous laws and systems that would take hundreds of years to establish.* 

“But I want you to be back here as soon as you are done with that. As you know, the inspector will be arriving today and I want you to meet him,” Iago said.

“Okay, Mr. Iago,” Liu said. Turning to the door, Liu left Iago’s manor.

Liu walked along the new cobble paths, past the multitude of sheds; six for storing crops, one for storing tools and farming equipment, one for storing the animal feed reserves, and the long stable for the horses. Each shed was freshly painted, red and yellow. 

Past the sheds were the fields, which was majority of Iago’s land. Past the first rice field, a group of farmhands huddled next to a dark circular well, which sat in between the first and second rice field. Liu sped his walk as he saw who he was looking for: a young, short farmhand with dark skin.

A few of the farmhands rolled their eyes as Liu approached. Liu spoke directly to the short man as if he didn’t even see the others.

“Bao, how many of the fields have you watered this week?” Liu asked.

“I watered all the ones on the North side of the farm. Tomorrow I’ll do the South side, like usual,” Bao replied. 

“During this season, maintaining the water depth of five inches is critical,” Liu said. “You can water each field less, but we need to water every field every day.”

Bao groaned. “But it’s so much work!”

“It takes you around twenty-five minutes to water each field, and there are twelve fields in total. Including walking time, that’s less then six hours. You have an easier workload then everyone else on this farm,” Liu shot back.

“Isana, why do you have to be such a little Oka, Liu?” A taller, dark-skinned man stood in between Liu and Boa. It was Cheng, who had tussled with Liu before. Cheng looked down at Liu with angry eyes, and Liu could smell the stench of his breath, which smelled even worse then the dung of Iago’s horses.

“Hey, hey. There’s no need for a fight here. Liu is just doing his job,” a thin arm slid in between Cheng and Liu, who both turned to face the intervener. It was a dark-skinned farmhand, slender and pretty with long black hair. 

With a snort, Cheng backed away from Liu, sitting down dirt path. The group of farmhands stood in silence awkwardly, until the girl who broke the silence turned to Liu.

“We were talking about the recent election before you came along. Don’t you think it’s pretty exciting, Zho Gato rustling up the Imperial Senate and all?”

“Well, it is quite excellent that Delmia has finally joined the Empire, but it was unfortunate to see that we picked someone like Gato to be our first leader. It seems like he intends to get what he wants, no matter the havoc caused.”

The girl stepped back, a look of concern on her face. Cheng’s glare hardened, as he stood up again to face Liu.

“What he wants is for us to get what we rightfully deserve! What are you, some kind of fucking Backuh?” Cheng yelled, pointing an angry finger towards Liu.

“I am not--- a traitor. Like everyone, I want to see the best for Delmia, and it is clear that the best Delmia is a Delmia united with the Empire.”

Liu looked around the group of farmhands; who clenched fists and vilified their glares. Apprehensively raising his palms in front of his chest, he motioned for peace.

With a sudden strike, Bao raised his hands to the air, and a plethora of water flew out of the well and shot at Liu. His body drenched and shocked from the sensation of the splash, he wasn’t able to react as the flurry of fists launched at him.  Soaked, stunned, and hurting, Liu’s back crashed against the ground as the farmhands loomed over him, kicking him without apprehension.

Liu kept his eyes double-shielded with both his eyelids and his hands, and he kept them there for several seconds after the beating had stopped, the full aching of his ribs and legs just making themselves apparent. He heard the footsteps draw away from his crumpled body, and he slowly drew his fingers apart so there was a small gap for him to peek through.

Liu slowly peeked open his eyes. Cheng was looming over him, and he instinctively curled his body, preparing for another blow. 

And then down from Cheng’s mouth shot a ball of spit, covering Liu’s hands and seeping through the gaps onto his face. Cheng walked away from the shivering, bruised, broken Liu, and out his mouth came one final blow.

“Fucking Backuh.”
