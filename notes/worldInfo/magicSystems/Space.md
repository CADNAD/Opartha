Transportation

Moving Items,

* The more elements are in the compositions the harder it is to effect. Knowing the two elements can help, but it will not help much. Because moving a thing that is separate from everything else is easiest 
* The heavier it is the harder
* The more surface area the easier it is to find
* Moving things you donâ€™t know is the hardest, this is why seeing things is basically necessary 
* They see the things the same and find the objects in 
* The more parts a thing has the harder it is to move
