SYNODONTIS - from eager ruler, to doubtful messiah, to forced conqueror, to runaway ruler, to vengeful god

Synodontis expects things to be smooth, poetic, and peaceful, like everything he's remembered his entire life: both real and fictional. He's not oblivious to pain, but being invincible, and sheltered, and able to heal himself or his friends at any time, he is not used to things going badly.

Wosa has made clear to him what a big responsibility his rule is, and he accepts that, but still expects things to go well, and also is under the false assumption that like a king, he can be friends with anyone and make anyone his friend. he has definitely made 'unacceptable' friends before, which Wosa systematically eliminated.
