Alternative Okin storyline: Okin is a ROTHAR instead of an Ather who is tasked with hunting down Dark insurgents, however he is a very successful Rothar who has received both Justice and Bravery. (Backuh instead has Truth: some irony here.) 

This will have some extra conflict at the beginning when he finds out Damian is a Dark Herald, perhaps Okin can even have confront Billy directly.
