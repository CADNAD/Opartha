# Transportation

In both Manipulation and Force mode:
* The more surface area the easier it is to find
* The less mass, the faster you can move it
* Separating things that are fused is very difficult. It's mostly based on sight, and "the feel" of the invisible hand.
* They see the things the same and find the objects in
* The more parts a thing has the harder it is to move
