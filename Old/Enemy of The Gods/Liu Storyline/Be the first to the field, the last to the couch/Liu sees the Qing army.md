On the road ahead, a caravan of armoured men on horses drove through, their banners fluttering in the night wind, just past the edge of Mr. Iago’s property.  

The road was dimly lit by a single streetlamp, but Liu could tell they were imperial soldiers by their red and gold banners and shields.  He ran ahead as quickly as he could to get a better look.  Stopping a few meters before the edge of the road, where around forty men on horses galloped by.  One in every five carried a banner,  displaying a golden sun shining beams in all directions on a crimson background. The emblem of the Tzen Empire.

The horses all galloped at the same speed, and the formation of soldiers never broke.  Instead of forty-something individual soldiers galloping by, it was one strong, organized, intimidating unit.  

Liu took note of the soldiers’ gear, the design of the banners, and their horses. Each one was the same breed, and while Liu was somewhat disgusted by the animals, he knew that they were Gaoleinian horses from their jet black skin, lack of spots, and heavy builds.  

He watched in awe as the end of the platoon galloped off into the distance. As the last banner disappeared past the horizon, he ran back towards his cabin.

Liu entered his humble residence.  It was twelve feet by ten feet,  containing a bunk bed, a small wooden desk with a drawer and a chair.  On the desk were several candles and matches.  He took a seat in the rickety chair and lit a candle, then opened the drawer where he had stored a stubby pencil and a few sheets of coarse brown paper. 

With great precision, Liu drew a Tzen soldier on a horse, wielding the Tzen banner. Before long, he had drawn what was close to a mirror image of one of the soldiers he had seen minutes before. 

Liu picked up the candle and his drawing. Carefully setting the candle down next to the door, he scanned the surface to find a rusty iron nail he’d noticed the night before, wedged haphazardly in the rotting wood. With some effort, he extracted the nail from the door, before pinning the paper to the hole in the dim candlelight.
