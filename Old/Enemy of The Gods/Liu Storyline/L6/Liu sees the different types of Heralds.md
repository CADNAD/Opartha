The squad of boys marched back onto the field, going not quite as far as the Hyo-Ra battlefield. It was still bright; the clouds had cleared away and the sun was above them and slightly to the west. Liu saw line of men already standing there--- straight backed with perfect posture, as if they were also trainees waiting for their sergeant or commander.

But Liu knew they were not trainees. The youngest was slightly older than any of the boys in Iri’s squad, and they all wore coloured tunics, unlike the grey, plain tunics worn by all the trainees, or the red and gold tunics worn by the commander.  A few yards away, besides them, were six training dummie, packed with hay.

Liu recognized one of the men standing in the line--- it was the Dark Herald who he had played Hyo-Ra with, the shaved man stood in his dark robe at the end of the line.

There were five other men in the line, a tall, thin man with a ivory tunic, likely Beisanian, a shorter, rounder man wearing brown, a very muscular man with a bald head wearing yellow, a long-haired man that sported purple and the man with a scarred face who wore bright red, but without the golden accenting of the commanders. 

Iri directed the boys to stand in line, facing the colourfully-robed men. Liu was directly in front of the brown-robed man, who stared forward indifferently.

“Attention!” Iri shouted. “Today you are getting a great opportunity to see the abilities some different Heralds that are common on the battlefield! While most of you will probably flunk out of this academy before the semester is over, those few who do graduate may find themselves face-to-face with some Herald squads in the future! Some of you big-shot idiots may even think you have the balls to command a group of Heralds, so listen up,” Iri’s voice lowered into its normal tone. “Or don’t, I really don’t care.” Iri turned to the man with the white robe. “Nao-Li, please demonstrate your abilities.”

The thin man gave a nod, and the five other men stepped back, giving him space. Nao-Li bent his head up to the sky, taking a deep breath and placing his hands together in front of his chest as he closed his eyes.

Liu stepped back, shielding his face as the immense storm of light flashed into his eyes. Even with his eyes closed, his vision was almost covered in a deep neon glow.

Turning back after a few seconds, Liu saw Nao-Li was now lunged forward, his hands extending out towards the six dummies, or five, considering one had fallen over and had a large hole burned through its chest, the wide circle still glowed orange from the impact.

“A Flasher,” Iri said, motioning to Nao-Li. “Or as the Institutes would say, a Radiation Herald. They can absorb light from the sun or other sources and release them as powerful blasts. Other abilities include healing others, but you can probably understand why we won’t be showcasing this one.”

Iri gave an affirmative nod, and Nam-Li stepped back. “Xun,” Iri said, motioning to the plump brown-robed man.

The man stepped forward, turning towards the dummies. He had some bulky objects in his pockets, and took them out, holding an equal amount in each hand; Liu saw that they were just ordinary stones, on the smaller size. 

The stones started to float up out of the man’s hand’s, hovering in the air above his chest. He then slowly circled his hands closer towards his chest, his palms still facing up towards the rocks.

In a rapid motion, the man twirled his hands upwards hand outwards, the stones zoomed towards the dummies, making several tearing sounds as they teared through the thin cloth skin.

The man then reached both hands down to the ground, and cracks in the earth began to form. Shaking, his hands moved upwards and a decent-sized chunk of ground moved upwards with it, some of the looser dirt falling back to the particles below. The man pushed again, knocking over one of the dummies who was hit square in the ‘face’, the others covered in dirt. 

“And the best part is, we won’t even need to clear up that hole later,” Iri said, as the stout man pulled upwards on the ground below, filling the hole in. Iri clapped, and the man bowed before stepping back into line.

The next demonstrator stepped forward first, looking as if he was waiting for Iri, who stood puzzled for some time. “Oh yes,” Iri said, a mischievous grin on his face. “I require a volunteer for the next demonstration.”

The boys stood silent. No one raised their hands, in fact, no one moved a muscle.

“Oh, come on. He’s not going to attack you. Actually, the volunteer will be allowed to take a free shot at Tao here.”

Finally, one of the boys, much larger than Liu in every dimension, stepped forward. 

“Alright, great, Huang,” Iri said. “Alright, when you’re ready, just punch. As hard as you can.”

The large boy faced down the man, who oversized him in both muscle and height, but was much leaner. The man was a statue, arms by his side.

“Anywhere?” Huang asked Iri.

“Anywhere,” Iri replied.

The boy smiled, leaning down, bringing his arm down and back to charge up a shot. Then he swung upwards, his fist barreling into the man’s groin--- and the boy fell to the ground, clutching his fist, biting his lip to hold in the wails of pain.

The other boys laughed, as did Iri. 

“Just for the record, the powers make him hard all over, not just you know, hard,” Iri said through chuckles.

Iri’s behaviour is confusing.  This is military training, why does he seem to act so... carefree?

Smiling, Iri nodded to the yellow-robed man, who stepped back in line with the other Heralds, as a few of the boys, including Peng, helped a cringing Huang off the ground.

“You know, things like that almost make me not hate my job. Anyway, strongman Tao here is a Tank, or as the Institutes would say, an Absorption Herald. He can absorb light to increase the density of his bones and muscles, which obviously increases durability and strength. He can also use light to heal himself,” Iri said, turning to Huang, who was still rubbing his fist. “Hey, if you think you broke a bone or something, perfect, then Nao-Li can show off his healing,” Iri smirked.

Huang shook his head, still cringing. 

“Alright then, since we played Hyo-Ra this morning, you already saw the powers of a Summoner or a Creation Herald. The summons which we use in Hyo-Ra are very weak and simplistic, but Summoners can summon extremely powerful and complex summons. Unfortunately, they need the ‘summoning area’ to be entirely darkness or shadow, so Lau won’t be able to create any big ones here.”

The man who Liu had played Hyo-Ra with, Lau, stepped forward. He raised his right hand to his temple and pointed the left towards the ground directly in front of himself, where his shadow lay. Moving his finger in a line, the violet wisps followed his fingers, leaving behind the shape of a long serpent. Then he raised two other fingers, and two other lines sprouted from the centre of the haze which shaped the serpent’s body. Finally, the serpent popped to life, or perhaps three serpents popped to life, as the three heads shared one tail and backside, but nothing else.

Liu stepped back a bit from the slithering amalgamation. The Hyo-Ra summons looked nearly identical to many real-life animals, but this was just a monstrosity. There was no way anything like this existed in any of the continents, or at least Liu hoped not. No one really knew what existed in Krinosas, but he wouldn’t really have to worry about that.

Many of the other boys looked equally as terrified, except for Peng and Khan. Khan displayed his normal smirk, while Peng watched the creature with wide eyes.

Lau snapped his fingers, and the serpent disappeared into mist. 

“Thank you, Lau,” Iri said. Lau nodded, stepping back into line with the rest of the Heralds as Iri turned to the boys again. “Don’t worry, that thing doesn’t exist in real life. Summoners can create creatures with almost any different characteristics, only limited by their power level, mental capacity, and imagination. Many learn from Summoners of the past, while others opt to create their own summons.”

Hm. Create creatures with any characteristic? That would be extremely valuable. How did the academy afford to higher not just one, but two?

“For our last demonstration, Zhan and Jia will perform in tandem.
