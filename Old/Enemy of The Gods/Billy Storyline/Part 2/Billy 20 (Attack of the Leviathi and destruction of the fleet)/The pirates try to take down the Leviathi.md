The group of them shuffled away from the gap. Billy watched the chase: the dark blur streaked across the waters, sometimes even slowing its blinding pace for the monster to catch up. The Leviathi’s thrashing jolted the dark vessel behind them.

“Attention!” A bellow came from above. It was the red-bearded pirate, who stood atop the crow’s nest. “Liquids, Gases! Stabilize the ship! Everyone else, throw everything you got at that monster!”

The pirates hurried off into groups, throwing water and pushing wind, and the swaying of the ship calmed. Once again, an organized unit lined up along the side, pushing Billy and the others further towards the back. The Time Crystal continued to vibrate in his pocket.

Skewers, lances, and cannonballs shot out at the beast. Two men’s hands alit with the same golden glow as Allia’s. They fired out focused lasers of Light at the tail of the Leviathi---which just absorbed their blasts, its own skin lighting up with that identical glow. The monster was unbothered by the amalgam of projectiles being hurled at it--- it just focused those fiery eyes at the almost unnoticeable black whirl that ran circles around it. The most fiercely thrown spears would just resonate a small blink of Light on the scales of the massive Beast.

Bright balls of fire and the boom of cannons and blunderbusses exploded from the dark vessel as Kiatus and the Leviathi circled around it. It was a thundering armageddon that would have annihilated almost any fleet or army. It was also an exercise in futility.

The Leviathi curled around the stern of the warship after its prey, but its thick body jerked and crashed into the ship’s side from the rapid turn. Wood shattered. A giant wave thrusted the boat onto its edge. The masts and sails hit the surface. The starboard side completely dipped underwater and men that were just tiny figures at this distance tried the impossible task of clawing their way up a flat wooden surface, inevitably being sucked up by the merciless seas.

Everyone’s faces paled, and they tightened their grips against the rail. The pirates stopped their Heraldic assault and watched with frozen eyes as the Leviathi slithered across the opposite side of the ship in its chase of Kiatus.

“Please,” \[ comma, 2021-05-21 4:22 PM

Definitely have to cahnge this--- Allia was fighting for Jerel’s life and now she’s just letting him die??\]Jerel said, shaking his tied arms behind his back. “If something happens, we’ll have no hope.”

Allia nodded, and ran over to start untying the ropes around Avador. Benjamin helped out Evelyn and the other Herald.  

“Please, Billy,” Jerel said. “I know, I---“

“Give me your hands,” Damian said before spinning a wide-eyed Jerel around. He paused before untieing the ropes and squeezed Jerel’s arm. “And please. Do not make me regret this.”\[ Doesn’t feel that Damian\]

“I will not make you regret this,” Jerel nodded.

Damian pursed his lips and released the cuffs. When the ropes dropped to the floor, Jerel turned around and clasped his hands to bow slightly before scurrying off back to Avador and the others. His shoulder brushed Allia’s on the walk back, and her eyes filled with surprise. Billy pointed to Damian, and she nodded.  

The boat rocked again, and everyone clutched both hands to the railing. Billy slowed Time just to make out what was going on. He finally caught sight of the dark blur a good ship’s length or two in front of both the flagship and the seeking Leviathi. It had stopped and vibrated on the water, flashing between two different parallel points, facing the charging beast.

The creature opened its mouth of darkness. The Captain’s vibration slowed, and for a second it looked like the Leviathi would swallow Kiatus whole. 

The Leviathi slammed its jaws together. Kiatus leapt and his body crashed into the barreling train that was the beast’s face--- much more violently than before. Kiatus dissapeared from Billy’s sight on the far side of the Leviathi’s face.

A deathly howl hurried through the air. Even with his ears shut, Billy could hear the full bellow blowing out of the creature’s stomach and reverb all the way up its lengthy throat. The creature jerked its neck up. 

Kiatus, miraculously, was still alive. He clutched the bottom it’s sharp, scaly ear. 

A vile neon liquid shined off of the pearly white tooth in Kiatus’ hand--- its jagged end was thrust in the now quivering eye of the Leviathi.

The shrills blew through the sky. The monster thrashed, and Kiatus flew off its head in a blur, disappearing into the feral waves. The Leviathi’s tail whipped in the sky, and a massive splurge of water overcame the ship. It shook its entire spine and rose like a cobra, water dripping down the wide lines on its side. The rest of the fleet halted in front of the flagship, and and Billy heard their distant hurrahs and stomping as men aimed weapons at the beast. 

The Leviathi flared its nostrils and darted its lone pupil. Billy could only see the side of the beast’s head that hadn’t been stabbed by Kiatus. The bright orange ring glanced mostly in between two of the boats ahead of the flagship. 

“Fire!” Commanders on the distant boats shouted, and cannonballs and harpoons that looked more like pebbles and toothpicks firing at such a massive creature jettisoned out from the decks of the ships. 

“Hold your fire, hold your fire,” the red-bearded pirates shouted at Billy and the others from above. 

Beams of red and golden light and blasts of fire joined the avalanche of projectiles that showered the beast, who only continued to turn its head slowly to scrutinize the fleet. Every attack failed to pierce skin and even get a reaction from the monster. 

“Aim for its eye!” Billy heard another shout. Men tried to curve their projectiles up, but none could reach that high and hit it accurately. The closest was a fireball whooshed into steam upon hitting the Leviathi’s jaw.

One of the boas in the centre wasn’t firing as much as the others, and instead was gradually turning so that its front would face the belly of the beast. Billy caught the edge of the quivering, closed eye as the Leviathi looked over their ship, but the laceration disappeared from his sight again when it turned back to the others. 

The ship rotated faster, and stopped as its bowsprit almost lined up with the Leviathi. Billy could just make out a dark doublet commanding the ship in the centre of the deck.

Suddenly, the monster’s head stopped over the ship turning in he centre and almost on cue, the men stopped firing, the ship stopped turning, possibly out of fear, or from finally realizing the futility of their assault.

Billy turned away and scrunched his face.

The giant scaly head barrelled into the ship. Masts fell and pinned screaming pirates through the deck. Men threw themselves off the side only to be washed into splintered wreckage or grabbed under the current.

A dark streak whizzed over the back of the Leviathi, and the beast’s head curled back, pushing the back half of the shipwreck and further splitting the ship into several jagged pieces. The pirates continued their assault, and there were more chants to aim at the beast’s unfractured eye, but the vast frenzy saw few sharp ends or bright strikes even reach the beast’s head underwater.

Kiatus continued to circle around the two other remaining vessels, leaving the flagship behind along with the two wreckages. He did a figure-eight between them, letting the pirates get within distance so even the non-Heralds could throw an accurate shot, but still nothing damaged the Leviathi.

The dark blur sprung forward to gain a quick lead on the Leviathi, then whipped around in a u-turn before the beast had time to react. Billy slowed Time and leaned in over the rail; The monster squirmed and spun its neck over the water while Kiatus held on tight, his fist pounding down against it at a million miles an hour.

The beast roared and twisted its neck, loading it up to flick Kiatus off. Its neck belted to the side, and its serpentine body crashed into one of the remaining boats, baring a large hole but not taking it down completely. Pirates screamed and fled as the ship dipped under water.

Kiatus flung through the air over the ship. He splashed below water before lurching back up and transforming back into that dark streak of pure speed.  The Leviathi arced its neck like a cobra, red eyes alight, its forked tongue slithering out through rows of man-sized teeth.

Billy slowed Time, but his widened eyes still couldn’t keep up with the flurry of Kiatus’ legs. 

The Leviathi’s head slunk down so its open mouth pointed towards the water, neck ready to strike at the approaching blur.  It had on a devilish grin of hunger that none could expect an animal to produce; it opened its mouth in a curve that reveled in its own victory.

Kiatus raised his arms straight in the air, the beast’s fangs launched at the charging pirate, and the Captain skyrocketed between those jaws of death. 

The monster swallowed, and Billy almost fell backwards, but his shock was nothing compare to the Leviathi’s; even its stabbed eye burst forth like a squeezed tomato, and it froze.

Before intensely convulsing while screeching like ghoul.

The storm returned in full force, a myriad of chipped debris flying in the air with the wet avalanche. Billy closed his eyes and crouched down as he squeezed against the rails, only peeking up his curled neck to check if Damian was still at his side. The boy had done the same as himself, his soaked hair covered his face against the rails.

“Go, go!” the red-bearded pirate shouted from the crow’s nest. The wind whipped against the sails, but the feeling of the boat moving forward was subdued by the violent rocking and chill of the oncoming waves.

Billy’s ears shook from a brutal explosion that sounded from a faraway ship. The drowned shrill of the beast heightened again, and he shivered.

“Speed up, speed up! We have to reach the coast of Krinosas! Wreathward is much too far gone now!” 

“Urgh,” a groan echoed just to the left of Billy. He looked up--- Benjamin on one knee, carefully standing up.

“What are you doing, Benjy?” Billy shouted, wet hair lashing his own face. 

“This ship too heavy! If we want chance of escape we must throw things off! I’m Space Herald, I must help!” the large man shouted back and stood to his feet.

The throaty roar of the Leviathi echoed behind them.

“He’s right!” Damian turned to Billy and also rose with shaky legs. “We have to help get things off the ship and detract that monster away if we want to get out of this alive!”

Billy’s already pounding heart shook his entire being. “It’s too dangerous!” He bit his lip as he met his brother’s youthful face. “You stay here, I’ll go!”

“No, Damian’s right. If we want to survive, we all have to help!” Allia shouted from behind.

Billy’s jaw tensed. He wanted to scream at her to shut up--- why did she always have to get in the way of him and his brother? But it wasn’t the time for bickering now, so he stuffed the fear and anger down. With two arms on the rail, he brought himself to his feet.

“Fine,” he met his brother’s eyes. “Be careful, and yell if you’re in danger.”

Damian nodded, and the four 

Allia carefully stomped over to the gap in the rail where they had set the plank, and rolled a cannon off the side.



Some pirates desperately held on to planks and railing which were blown into the current.
