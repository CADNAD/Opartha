The city itself seemed near bursting, yet there was an air of organized chaos to the place. A variety of storefronts which included fortune telling, antiques, postal offices, accounting firms, and brothels, just to name a few. They made up the first floor of nearly every building he passed. Between them, food stalls and street performances crowded the roads. But despite the commotions in the streets, the city seemed more organized than most he had visited. The main streets themselves were rings which slowly expanded outwards, with the mountain at the centre. Of course, where else would you put a seat of power, besides near that thing. And the streets themselves, despite crowding by all manner of stalls and other enterprising types, still left clear space down the centre to walk. As he wound his way down these paths, following Allia and Avador, the exotic atmosphere was more familiar than he expected. The haggling, joyful screaming, and fragrant food reminded him of Apathasaw. It was strange that he had travelled most of the known world, yet found himself in much the same place he started. 

There was a certain comfort in the long walk. Though the scenery was stagnant, it was familiar. The only difference Billy could notice as he drew closer to the centre was a subtle rise in height. 

“We should probably give them a primer on how to act, shouldn’t we?” Avador asked, breaking the silence of the trip.

“I believe they are all quite well mannered.”

The man gave Allia a stony stare which seemed to frighten the girl. “You know how anal they can be, don’t you? At least make sure they don’t gawk.” 

Allia released a small sigh, relenting to the man. “I suppose you are right.” She turned to the three men behind her and stopped them in the street. 

“When we go see the Dakungs, you must show them the utmost respect and reverence. I can plead as much as I want, but if they do not see you as amicable, then they will not accept you, and I can do nothing for you.” 

“Wait, what?” Billy took a step in front of his two friends. “I thought you guaranteed us safe housing.” 

She drew her mouth into a thin line, “I don’t suspect you will be rejected. Thus, I was fairly confident in my offer.”

“Farily confident still makes it an cinking lie” 

“If you simply cooperate, then there will be no problem. I promise you.” 

Billy squinted at the girl, face firm. He scanned the older man, who was lounging against a goods stand nearby, then looked back at Allia.

“I swear by the Forces that my promises will be fulfilled. As long as you promise to cooperate as best you can.” *Just bend over and let me use you. Trust me, it’ll be perfectly fine. Just play your part so that I can go about forgetting about you and all the other people I’ve stepped on. Thanks!* That was what she was really saying. But of course she wanted him to shut up and play a part, no one ever cared what he wanted, what he felt.

“We’ll see,” he finally said. 

“Alright then, we’ll lead you into Banuro, and like Chowondo Avador, please try to keep your wits about you.” The way Allia and Avador spoke made Billy feel like a child again. What could truly be so amazing as to warrant a warning to its awe and majesty? What made this *Banuro* so great that it would leave the uninitiated a drooling ,witless mess? 

“Well, I think that’s about it,” Avador turned from the food stall he had been lounging on and pointed them down a nearby alley.

There was something peculiar about the turn. Unlike most streets which opened up both ways, one end of this road led to the back of a building on the previous ring, while the other led to an alley which ended, leading into the mountain. The path itself seemed to meld into the mountain side, blending like the edges of colour in a water-painting.  

Billy opens his mouth to speak, but stopped as Avador began to run his hand along the stone. The man rubbed the stone with a fondness and Billy though he could hear the man whispering to the stone. The man ran his hands along the stone till he found both hands rested softly into two depression in the stone. Firmly pressing his palm into the stone an entrance way began to open in front of them. The stone retreated into itself revealing a rounded doorway about 2 meters high and a meter wide. 

Billy shook his head lightly, processing the events before him. Allia had told him not to gawk, yet he couldn’t help it. He had seen Solid Heralds before, but nothing had ever moved so fast. The way the stone seemed to be sucked in a near instant.

“Welcome to Banuro,” Allia said as she stepped through the hole and into a whole new world.
