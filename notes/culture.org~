*** Onorun and Canonical Verses
**** Neiman
Neiman 1 1:4: He hated no one, not even his enemies!

Neiman 2 14:25 It is what we do over our lifetimes that shows what we are. The Four or the Darkness within. 

Neiman 4 2:8 "/Virtue and Vice cannot be united, neither can Versalist Truth and Wisdom with foreign Deceptions and Foolishness, just as the Four could not be at Peace amongst the Darkness/"


**** Aredal
*Aredal 1 1:24: Being honest when it suits you is easy, it is being honest when it doesn’t that is honourable.* *Even the liar tells the truth in ordinary matters, it is the honest man who reveals his shortcomings.*

*Aredal 1 1:45: To oppose Truth is not just to speak outright lies. Witholding information for the sake of one’s status or reputation, twisting the tongue to use the words of Truth but the essence of Deception, blocking the eyes, ears or mind from Knowledge which reveals Truth, this is all Deception.* 

Aredal 1 8:2: Truth is not just telling no lies when asked-- it is a duty to use one's voice to spread it as far as possible./

Aredal 1 4:8: Be upfront both about what you know and what you do not know.

Aredal 2 4:14 My Compassion will hear all those who hear me. 

Aredal 3 5:17 "/Temperance is not always mindless renunciation, but it is taking the middle road. The road of reason, contemplation, and patience./"

Neiman 7 18:4 "Only a fool or a demagogue, will say, before the signs have come, that they are near, and therefore, change should be upon us."



Rentar 1:6 /the Light of Aredal was radiant, none could look upon him and admit him a normal man, or be left unchanged by him/ 



Votaas 4:6 spirit is more crucial than appearance, as the Darkness can manipulate the appearance

Neiman 7 6:3 Traitors of the highest rank, in the least expected places
