He could see it all now, several dozen Athers conversing on the grass. There were only a couple men with the same masks as him, though. They talked amongst themselves, so it was a bit easier for Okin to move through unnoticed.

There was a line in front of the doorway to the house. Okin walked over to get a better look.

He peeked over. At the end of the line was a man not wearing a mask, who sat behind a table lined with several of the different animal mask and costumes. He handed a spiky Tarnavin mask to the Ather in the front, who took it graciously before entering the house.

Okin watched tow others get their costumes before sliding out of the line. 

*Can I just... go through?* 

He strolled past the line--- thankfully no one could tell how tense he was completely covered in dark drabs. 

He glanced to the table, and met the clerk’s eyes. He shook.

The clerk merely smiled, and instinctively, Okin returned a relieved one.

He laughed at himself a little inside as he remembered that the man couldn’t see.

*Yes... they can’t see anything. As long as I keep the mask on... this should be perfect for me.*

*Why the masks, though?* Okin thought. Didn’t they make it easier for people to find the identity of the cult members?

Then again, no one else beside him and Ateon probably knew of the cult’s connection to these masks. They must’ve been doing this for some secretive purpose. Now Okin would use their own Deception against them. 

Okin stepped into Aldwin’s manor. He had only been inside a couple times before, and definitely wasn’t used to so many people packed within its walls.

He didn’t even expect that most clergy would be excited by a gathering like this. Maybe Citadel Athers were more different from the Southern clergy than he expected.

And he *definitely* didn’t expect to see *Gendro* at the party--- unmasked.

The Rothar, still wore his shiny armour that stuck out from the rest of the group. He trudged past, brushing and even hitting some shoulders as he made his way towards the dining room table.

Okin got a *thump* in the shoulder. His eyes widened, and for a second, he expected Gendro to recognize him. But the Rothar just kept marching on.

“Impalias Aldwin, Impalias Aldwin!” Gendro raised a hand at the dining table.

Okin looked on. Aldwin was sitting at the table, drink in hand. Several others were reaching over to take sliced meats and cheeses from the platters resting on the table. 

“Rothar Gendro? You are not dressed up for an occasion that calls for costumes? I thought that would appeal to the Joy of Nexon. I find it hard to believe that you missed the free masks handed out at the front.”

Men shuffled past and blocked Okin’s view. The Ather stepped aside, hugging the edge of the wall as to be less visible yet get a good view.

“I--- I did not come here for the occasion. I--- High Ather Okin is missing. I know that you and him may have had some sort of disagreement recently--- but please, I think he may be in danger! Do you know anything about his whereabouts?” Gendro asked.

“I--- I apologize, Rothar Gendro, but I have no idea where Okin is. You are his Rothar, surely he must have told you something?” Aldwin responded.

Okin could hear an ever-so-slight *smugness* in his voice, though he tried so hard not to.

He *still* didn’t want to believe it, despite all evidence pointing one way. Aldwin, his mentor, had tried to have him *killed*, and was now revelling in his success. 

But piercing through the anger was also a little bit of sneaky Pride in Okin knowing that the Truth was that Aldwin’s success was a lie.

And Okin would use that to his *absolute* advantage.

“Please, Aldwin!” Gendro shouted. He was losing his politeness a little, but Aldwin didn’t flinch and kept up a forced but cordial smile.

It was--- it was *strange,* seeing Gendro like this. So serious, and--- frankly, *caring* so much about something. The man always seemed so aloof and jolly whenever Okin was around.

Seeing his Rothar beg so helplessly to Aldwin--- it made him want to sneak over and reveal himself. He pictured Gendro’s panic transforming into joyous bright eyes and a loud, clear smile, and then further transitioning into a characteristic jolly smirk as he made a quip about Okin’s disappearance. \[ 2021-12-07, 4:59 PM

Perhaps have Okin do this “literally”--- and then reveal it was him imagining it\]

But no, he couldn’t give up the one advantage he finally had.

“I--- I apologize, Rothar Gendro, but I do not have any clue of his whereabouts,” Aldwin patted Gendro on the shoulder. “Of course, I will be on the lookout and let you know if I spot anything. I know that Okin was eager to speak to the Arbiters of Justice and Bravery, perhaps he sought out one of them and went on a mission.”

Aldwin removed his hand from Gendro’s shoulder and forced a wider smile. Gendro opened his mouth to continue--- but stopped himself and lowered his hand. Aldwin nodded to two others--- both in dark drabs and identical grey-beaked masks, and the three of them got up, leaving the slumped Rothar alone.

Partygoers swarmed by, but Gendro stayed fixed. Okin expected anger, as he had when confronting Aldwin’s treachery, but he saw only despair. Gendro stared at the floor and his head shook ever so slightly.

A taller man, dressed in large fur cape and with an intricate snout-nosed mask resembling a Bortog, bumped Gendro as he ran for the food table. The Rothar lurched forward, but his body returned to its original state, and his head and eyes still looked to the ground.

Okin’s jaw tensed--- a voice from within told him to let the Rothar’s conscious rest. 

But a stronger voice--- the voice of Justice--- knew that Okin couldn’t. This mission was the priority, and *nothing* could interfere with that. And plus, Gendro didn’t exactly have a great track record for keeping quiet.

So he turned away until the mass of partygoers covered up the Rothar in his peripheral vision.

His attention was redirected as he saw Aldwin and the two beaked-masked march in his direction out of the corner of his eye. The Ather forced himself to stay as still as a statue. Nonetheless, Aldwin’s eyes met his, and Okin froze.

Aldwin started to open his mouth.  Okin wanted to run, but all he could do was shiver.

“It’s time, everyone! Get in your groups!” The Impalias shouted. It was  loud enough that it could be heard all throughout the house, and even outside.

Okin shook more at Aldwin’s blaring voice, but a huge weight lifted off his shoulders as he realized Aldwin directed no suspicion at him. 

In fact, Aldwin gave him a straight-faced nod, and he and the two other beaked-masked men turned up the hall and marched up the stairs.

Men in all sorts of masks also made their way through. The men with the furry masks and capes passed Okin to get outside, and many of the men with the scaly masks lined \[ 2022-01-08, 6:03 PM

Check to see creatures\]with tooth-like spikes followed them. Many of the men wearing masks representing a Krinosian horse seemed to be coming from the outside in.

And a man wearing one of those black beaks like that of a raven--- identical to the one that Okin wore--- turned up at the steps which Aldwin and the others had ascended.

Though he was scared, Okin felt the urge to follow him. 

Before he could think about it more, his feet were marching besides the other man’s up the stairs. Though Okin couldn’t see his eyes, the man gave a similar, serious nod like the one Aldwin had.
