# Apathasaw:

Apathasaw is both a continent and regional confederacy. (Technically, the proper political title is *The Confederacy of Apathasawian Designatories*, but almost everyone commonly refers to the political/geographical entity as just Apathasaw.)

The Confederacy is made up of Regional Designatories, which are most commonly a combination of corporate and private-owned lands  which themselves have confederated. There are several Regional Designatories that are part of the Confederacy, and usually support the Confederacy on the global stage. However, Designatories are not *required* to agree on foreign actions, and therefore foreign nations often find themselves negotiating with a couple of Designatories instead of the whole Confederacy, and sometimes in negotiations the “Confederacy” will actually only really be a couple of designatories.
