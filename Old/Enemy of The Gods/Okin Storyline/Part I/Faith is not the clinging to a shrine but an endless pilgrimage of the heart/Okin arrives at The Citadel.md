“Fin-all-y!” Gendro shouted.  

The massive grey walls loomed over the riders.  The circular barrier had been visible for miles, but Gendro had fallen asleep soon after Okin had taken the reins.  They sat in the shadow of The Citadel.

Past the multitude of carriages and riders that were lined up in front of them was a large steel gate that split down the middle, the giant black half-doors were spotted with large domes. Every minute or so, the gate would open, letting a small caravan inside.

Far above them were the watchtowers that ran around the city walls.  There was supposedly hundreds of Rothars who stood guard atop them day and night, but Okin could never see them; from afar they were much too small, and from this close he couldn’t see the top of The Citadel’s walls.

As they drew closer to the front of the line, the circular walls now encompassed Okin’s peripheral vision.  He could hear the entrance guards questioning the travellers at the front of the line.

“Do you already have any property inside The Citadel?” 

“How long do you plan to stay in The Citadel?”

“Do any of you possess any forms of Heraldry?”

“Try to look like you didn’t just get up,” Okin whispered to Gendro as their carriage rolled up to the gate.  Gendro nodded, and then gulped. 

“Hello High Ather, fellow Rothar,” the leader of the four entrance guards said.  The other three began circling the carriage, eyeing it cautiously.  “May I please see your Dedications?”

Okin rolled up his sleeve, showing his palm to the guard.  A black, four-pointed star of Aredal was etched into it, sat ontop a golden triangle which pointed upward to his middle finger.

Gendro did the same, showing the long, black vertical line which marked a Dedicant of Nexon, intersecting a blue Hexagon which proved his Joy.

The armoured man nodded, and the two men set their wrists down.  Looking to Gendro, he asked, “Where are you stationed?”

“Fort Isla, sir,” Gendro replied.

“And where do you serve?” The man asked Okin.  

“Ariska,” Okin replied.

The man nodded.  “And why have you two come here, to The Citadel?”  

“I have vital information that I must relay to Impalias Aldwin,” Okin said.

The guard perked up.  “And of what nature might this vital information be?”

“I’m sorry,” Okin replied.  “But that is for the Impalias’ ears only.”

The guard fell silent, and the others finished their inspection, giving their leader an affirmative nod.

“Alright,” he finally said.  “Welcome to The Citadel.”

He gave three knocks on the massive iron gate, and slowly both sides pulled inward.  In an instant, a hidden world was revealed the two clergymen, the main street which shot through the gate was bustling,  people holding their goods and children as they weaved around the multitude of carriages.  Strolling past the massive, thick walls, the formerly invisible sounds of horseshoes clacking, men arguing and children laughing filled the air, and for the first time the two men took in the lifeblood of The Citadel.

Okin looked around the massive city.  Sure enough, encompassing the entire thing was the massive circular stone walls; still, he could not make out the guards that supposedly guarded them.  The main street that their carriage rolled through continued into the very centre of the town, and the roofs of the buildings grew higher and higher from their position near the outskirts to its core.  Directly in front of them was what had stuck in Okin’s mind since the day he visited for his promotion: the giant statue of a man with wavy hair, wearing ancient bronze plate armour, and the dazzling star which he held out to the surrounding lands. Aredal, God of Light, Truth, Justice, and Bravery. The God who Okin had Dedicated his entire life to.

Gendro must’ve been drawn to the same thing.  “How’d they even build that?  A Light Crystal of that size would weigh a ton,  and it’s just balancing in the palm of his hand.”

“It is one of the great wonders of The Citadel, possibly even of the world,” Okin said, his eyes still fixed to the blinding white light.

“Kind of a waste though.  That much Light Crystal would be worth a fortune,” Gendro said.

“It is worth far more where it is,” Okin replied.

The buildings in this outer section of the city were far more standard than what lied at its heart, and most who occupied them were commoners and noblemen.  Living in The Citadel was quite expensive; the land was artificially inflated due to its central religious power, and the city could never expand outwards as it was cut-off by the walls.  

There were also a massive population of Athers and Rothars.  Many of them received free housing, and the section of The Citadel that they were now approaching--- the middle ring--- was almost exclusively compromised of barracks and training camps where the wartime Rothars were held.  These buildings were less stylish and diverse than those in the outer ring, and looked quite similar to the outer walls.

“This might be the only time I’ll ever be here,” Gendro spoke as they continued forward.  “I hope I’ll have the chance to visit the Cathedral ere Nexon.”

“I’m sorry, Gendro,” Okin sighed.  “For once, you actually express interest in performing your duties as a Rothar, and I have to turn you down.  Unfortunately, our priority on this trip is reporting to Impalias Aldwin.”

Gendro sighed.  “Such a bore, as always.  We could possibly see it *after* we bring the news to the Impalias?”

Okin shook his head.  “We will do whatever the Impaliases see fit.  If they order us to stay in the city, then perhaps we will have time to visit the Cathedral.”

Gendro stayed silent.  *That’s a first,* Okin thought, before Gendro quickly broke it.  “You actually know him, don’t you?”

“Well, yes.  All High Athers report to an Impalias, and Aldwin is mine,” Okin said.  “Plus, I was a childhood friend of his son, and have known Aldwin since I was just a boy.”

*That’s right, Previa should be here.  I wonder if Aldwin took him to the Seat?*

“Ah, so you just got the job because you knew the boss,” Gendro smirked.  Okin rolled his eyes.

He continued to eye the effigy to the West, and the two which stood to its right and left, also at the centre of the city.  The features of both of these were obscured and only their profiles were visible, but Okin knew it was Nexon who faced to the North and Olitheon who faced to the South.  The last of the Four, Intillia, who faced to the East, was completely hidden by the massive structure which towered over the rest of The Citadel, directly embedded where the four Cathedrals intersected.  The twirling stone tower was the Seat of The Mouth of The Gods, reserved only for the Impaliases and His Holiness.

Gendro slowed the horses as they pulled up to the entrance of the Cathedral ere Aredal.  Okin stepped out of the carriage, bending his neck upwards.  The massive statue loomed above them, its feet resting on the massive white archways that covered the entrance to the Cathedral. 

In front of the archways stood a group of heavily armoured Citadel soldiers.    These were Devinars, the highest order of Rothars who either served as commanders during wartime or attended to the highest security needs of The Citadel.  

One of the Devinars stepped forward, stomping his foot down into a militaristic posture as he came to a halt in front of the carriage.  “Greetings High Ather, Rothar.  What is the meaning of your visit to The Cathdral ere Aredal?”

“I am Okin Cantas, High Ather ere Ariska.  Rothar Gendro and I have come here to deliver an extremely important message to Impalias Aldwin.”

Another one of the Devinars came over, whispering into the speaker’s ear.  

“Impalias Aldwin is not present at the Seat of The Mouth of The Gods.  He is most likely in his family homestead.  I may direct you there if you wish,” the Devinar said.

*That makes more sense.  I didn’t think Previa would be allowed into the Impalias’ meeting.*

“That would be wonderful, thank you,” Okin replied.  Okin eyed Gendro, who reluctantly hopped off the carriage with a sigh.  

“Oh no, I will take my own horse.  You may retake your seat, Rothar,” the Devinar said.

Gendro grunted, getting back onto the carriage.   He smiled slyly as he took the reins from Okin.
