Have Nexon have a stranger fighting style, also Nexon uses his Sped powers to punch the Leviathi extremeley hard but the Leviathi’s skin lights up because it is super absorption\] and bandanas flew off, swirling around in the water that had swamped the deck. Billy’s boots filled to the brim. Even Kiatus’ formerly pristine golden locks were dirtied by the waters. He whizzed to the front of the line, and shouted, “Men! Grab your weapons, your Crystals! Ready up for attack!” 

“Drats!” A pirate holding one of those lantern-cages that the Devinar had back in Metheno shouted. The men ambled up to the port side of the ship, where all could see the lengthy, slithering body of the beast rise above water. Much of its length was hidden by the white foam and the dark waters, but even the visible segment spanned the entire flagship.

“Take it down!” Kiatus screamed at the beast. 

Some had spears and harpoons and threw them at the beast, then pushed them faster through the air with the strength of Space Heraldry. The weapons didn’t seem to scathe the scales of the beast, and many just bounced off and fell into the waters. The Liquid Heralds stood at the edge of the ship, holding out spare hands in a futile attempt to quell the intruding waves; their tattered doublets were just as drenched as everyone elses’.

The Leviathi’s back and tail slunk under the water, heading towards the rest of Kiatus’ fleet. The ship’s rocking was still brutal, but the storming waves simmered.

Another ship of Kiatus’, smaller in size but with a massive array of cannons and harpoons, approached from behind, the only one whose front was to their stern. The Leviathi’s dark scales emerged next to it. From this distance, the other boat rocked so much that the masts flicked like a metronome.

Kiatus dashed off to the back of the ship where the prisoners were tied, and peered out towards his black vessel that was being soaked.

“If you want to have a chance to do anything with this beast, kid, calm it down!” Avador’s booming voice shouted. Billy inched forward to hear the conversation.

“Oh,” Kiatus gave an uneasy smile. “Well, yes. That was exactly what I was planning. I am sorry, my friend.”

He rushed off into a blur, and then appeared again at the side of the ship, next to the others, holding a tied-up Avador by the arms. “C’mon,” Kiatus pushed Avador to a section of the ship with no railing. “Men, get the plank.”

“You’re not---you can’t!” Allia grabbed Kiatus by the shoulder, hands shaking. Damian stood next to her, fingers still wrapped around the shaking rail, wide-eyed. The pirates splashed in the ankle-deep water next to them, carrying a board in their arms.

“You two are---friends?” Kiatus asked. “But it looks like he came here to capture you?”

“He’s a good man,” Allia said, brushing away her wet bangs. “Please.”

Kiatus pursed his lips and looked from a motionless, wrapped-up Avador to Billy.

“You---,” Billy squeezed his eyes shut and sighed. “You shouldn’t.”

“Well then. You *must* be someone special,” Kiatus said, patting Avador on the back. “I’ll get another.”

The Captain zoomed off with Avador, and returned with a shivering Jerel at his side. He held a coral horn with gold lining---one of the many valuables on display Billy had seen under the deck in his gallery--- and blew it out over the gap in the rail. It created a deep, horn-like sound. After it settled, so did the rushing waves.

“No!” Alllia shouted. “You can’t feed *anyone* to that thing!”

Kiatus raised an eyebrow and laughed at Jerel. “Now, maybe I’m just out of it, but it really looked like you two *really* didn’t get along.”

Though it was his doom being debated, there was still a hint of a glimmer in Jerel’s eyes at Allia’s protest, and she likely saw it, for she grimaced as she looked down at him. The Captain focused on the others, but Benjamin’s and Billy’s eyes just met the deck. Kiatus smiled and took a step forward to the now in-place plank with Jerel in front. To everyone’s surprise, Allia reached out an arm. 

“You’re right, I don’t like him. But please, you can’t just---“

A deep growl rumbled through the air, and the group turned to peer over the ship’s rail. Red eyes with blood orange pupils the size of cannonballs blinked above the water, and frilled spiky ears pointed up at the edges of the Leviathi’s slowly approaching face.

“It’s here!” Kiatus’ voice heightened and his face lit up like a child receiving a long-awaited toy. He turned to two pirates standing nearby. “If it looks like it’s going to attack, throw him in. But not too soon.” The Captain winked and disappeared off to toward the back of the ship. 

The crewmates nodded to each other. Each grabbed one of Jerel’s arms and waddled him forward.

“No,” Allia’s eyebrows narrowed as she grabbed one of them by the collar. Her hands---and eyes--- were glowing, and Billy had to stop himself from looking away. “You can’t. I won’t let you.”

“What are you gonna do? Throw *us* over?” The chubby man asked.

The Light faded along with Allia’s aggressive stance, and the pirate yanked his shirt back away from her. They continued to push Jerel forward toward the awaiting, hungry eyes of the beast. Finally, after a solid minute of silence, Billy heard whimpers from the scumbag as he walked onto the plank.

The Leviathi’s massive head inched forward. Its bright red eyes glared up at a shaking Jerel. Billy shook at those bright orange pupils, which were so big they appeared to be trained on him even when they weren’t.

The waters were chillingly calm. Billy’s face contorted into a more disturbed cringe every foot the Leviathi’s spiked head gradually approached. The dark vessel which Billy had seen rock so violently just as slowly advanced toward the side of the Leviathi’s head. Kiatus had one foot on it’s bowsprit, holding that massive, pearly tooth Billy had seen below the deck in one hand. The Time Crystal started to quiver again, and Billy clasped his pocket.

The ship slowed.  Jerel’s voice was lost into a mouses’ squeal. The Leviathi blinked, and he jerked so violently he almost fell off the plank. From the edge, Kiatus lunged into a ready stance. Even with Billy’s hand squeezed tight, the Crystal wiggled. 

He made it stop.

Woosh! Kiatus *zoomed* backwards. The Beast bared its fangs. The Captain whipped back around.  The Beast lurched up.  Kiatus shot off the bowsprit. 

He must’ve flew thirty metres\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-23 10:52 PM

Use of metric\] in the open air. He raised the pearly fang over his head.

The Leviathi’s jaw fully opened. Its back teeth were the size of legs. 

Kiatus threw his body forward and jabbed the jagged edge into the side of the beast’s neck.

A glowing Light surged from underneath the beast’s skin at the impact. Time returned to normal. Billy scrambled to get a better look. There was just that glow on the Beast’s scales where it’d been stabbed, but no impact. The Leviathi didn’t even flinch or howl. It just roared and whipped its body to the right, now trained on Kiatus instead of Jerel. 

Billy slowed Time. He could see the laughably tiny looking figure of the Captain below.  Kiatus fell into the Beast’s open\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-23 10:54 PM

Maybe just have Kiatus stab the Leviathi here, perhaps he tries to stab his skin but it won’t work\] mouth, and his left boot touched its tongue.\[ 2021-05-12, 8:13 AM

Perhaps have Billy time slow stuff here\] 

The Leviathi chomped, but a dark blur spurred out of its mouth and ripped through the waves around its closed jaws.

The monster ducked its head under, its red eyes glowed just below the surface. Its tail and body whipped and the waters erupted again. The ship rattled. Billy squeezed tighter against the rail, using his other arm to ensure Damian didn’t fall backwards.

Jerel’s feet slipped and he crashed down onto his back, getting jettisoned forward by the bouncy plank into the deathly waters below. A final hyena’s scream escaped his lips. Billy grimaced---did even a scoundrel like Jerel deserve such a nasty fate?

He didn’t have to ponder for long, though. Miraculously---or regrettably--- Jerel’s tied up body rose in the air. Billy’s wide eyes glanced around. Benjamin’s extended hand shook in the air,  gradually lifting Jerel up until his feet touched the plank again and he could scramble back onto the deck.
