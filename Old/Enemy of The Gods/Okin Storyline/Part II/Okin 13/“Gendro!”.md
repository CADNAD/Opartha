“Gendro!”\[ 2021-11-27, 3:38 PM

Possibly Change timeline of this chapter so Okin goes to printing shop in evening 14 starts close to night for a more believable ambush\]

Okin shook the sleeping Rothar by his robes.

“Gendro!”

Okin groaned, he was getting some foul looks from the Athers of the Cathedral, even though he was keeping his ‘shouting’ to a minimum. 

“Hey!” 

Okin grabbed Gendro’s shoulder and squeezed.

“Hey!” 

Gendro shouted and jumped in his seat. His knees hit the table and the books jumped up a little and slammed back down on the table. Gendro’s arm swung outwards and hit Okin the face.

All the attendees in the Cathedral turned their heads and stared at the two. Okin’s face was *doubly* red, and he held his nose. 

“Oh---,” Gendro shook his head. “I---I apologize, High Ather Okin--- I---“

“How much work have you actually done, Gendro?” Okin hissed in the Rothar’s ear. “There’s a lot of books here, but it seems like you only got a few pages farther than where I left off!” 

“I’m sorry, Okin. I only fell asleep a few minutes ago, I *think.* This is just--- *far* beyond the amount of Terridian we were required to learn in training! And the syntax, the---“

“Is all different, I know, I know,” Okin sighed, and peered over Gendro’s shoulder at the writing. It was surprisingly neat--- but there were *strange* serifs and curls, none like Okin had ever seen. 

“We’re not making much progress this way,” Gendro scratched his ear. “And I don’t even know if any our progress will even be valuable. The accuracy of this is...fishy at best.”

Okin closed several of the translation assitance texts and Terridian dictionaries on the desk and slid them out of the way. 

“I have a way to confirm it’s legitimacy,” the High Ather said. “Of all people, *Previa* actually gave me the idea.”

The Ather leaned in closer to Gendro and checked his peripherals. Everyone else appeared to have gone back to doing what they were doing before.

“Look, Gendro,” Okin said. “It is because we are faithful men, but we have been comparing this text to much to the *Onorun.* But if this text is truly what Ateon says it is, it is not surprising it would be radically different from the rest of the *Onorun.* But then its legitimacy comes into question.”

Gendro nodded, and Okin continued.

“Unfortunately, as much as it pains me to say it, we cannot fully trust that Ateon is telling the Truth, and therefore we must come to our own independent conclusion. May Aredal punish me if he is.”

“But--- based on what I have been presented, I *do* believe Ateon,” Okin found himself saying. As soon as the words left his lips, he bit them, and he raised is hand to clarify.

But, there was nothing *to* clarify. Out of habit, Okin had spoken the pure Truth. 

“B-but others will not be so inclined to believe in a new addition to the timeless *Onorun,”* the High Ather continued. “And understandably, even you are having severe doubts.” 

“But the *Onorun* is the *Onorun.* I can recite nearly every word in that text and I know there is nothing there that will help us fully confirm the legitimacy of this text. So we must look to other sources of the time.”

Okin looked around at the bookshelves, almost double his height, and the men who ran in and out between them, arms filled to the brim texts of all shapes and sizes. He smiled and was warmed within. In some places in Marthia, heathen zealots prohibited any Knowledge not directly attained through their religious doctrines, and information was not free among men. Through Olitheon, Versalists knew that information was necessary for the survival of society and forwarding one’s Dedication as much as possible. Only fruitless, purely heretical texts were removed from the libraries of The Citadel.

Perhaps Okin had discovered a *little* corruption among his ranks, and sure, for a time that had shattered him, but The Citadel itself was *good.* The clergy was *good*. Versalism was *good.* 

And *he* would be good to remember that.

“Get as many books as you can detailing historical wars and events from 300BA all the way to the Ascension. There has to be *something* to connect this text our history,” Okin said, and Gendro stood to his feet. 

“And we will find it in order to bring the Truth of Knowledge to our people.”
