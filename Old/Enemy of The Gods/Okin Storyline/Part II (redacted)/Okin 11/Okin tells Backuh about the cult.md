The water soaked through his shoes as he stomped through the puddles, his sweat mingling with the rain.

His heart pounded rapidly even as he stopped down an alley. Frantically swinging his head left and right to check for others, he rested his hands on his knees and focused on his breath.

Upon the dark grey bricks grew blackened puddles, which were outshined by the pitch-black night. The only source of light were the stars in the sky, and the one held in the hands of Aredal. 

Yet, strangely, Okin was not afraid of the night. Yes, he was terrified of returning to the visiting complex and being met by a gang of murderers, or worse, having them come to kill him in his sleep. Yes, he was terrified that somehow the Rothars had seen him run from the church and were right on his tail. But unexpectedly, despite that it was the time of Tregale, the time that all men should be afraid, he did not fear the night, he did not fear the Dark.

Standing back upright, Okin checked his six again. No one. He took a step forward, and then stopped.

*Breslo, Aldwin, Trenton, they all know exactly where I sleep. If Breslo’s group decides that it would be easier to dispose of me--- which it sounds like they already have---whether I wake in the morning will not be under my control.*

Okin turned around, and began to run again.

The Citadel was large, and its circular structure made it a little more difficult to memorize smaller streets and intersections, but Okin was determined, and had no doubt in his memory. The Ather found the southern marketplace--- which was deserted, and then continued down the same path which he had gone before.

He entered the beggar’s alley again. The lump was still there, covered by blankets, mostly dry due to the two rooftops which shadowed him above at different angles.

“Hello,” Okin spoke.

The beggar revealed himself, although it was so dark and as usual, his beard and hair covered his eyes and face, so Okin could barely tell.  “Hello, Okin. Find anything new?”

“Yes. There is some strange gathering of conspirators, which I assume entirely consists of clergymen. I was invited to this group by a High Ather named Breslo, but strangely he claimed that the group had been disbanded. I only found out of its nature because I followed the man to their meeting place.” Okin said. “They seek to manipulate the election somehow. They need votes for some reason.”

The beggar stayed silent for a while, his expression unreadable. 

“Anything else?”

“Yes, they said something about a harbinger. It sounds like their leader,” Okin said. “I also had a friend of mine follow Impalias Aldwin, who I believe has been acting suspiciously lately. He was the reason I was going to be sent home to Ariska,” Okin said. “Anyway, my tail followed Aldwin to a neighbourhood in the southern section of the outer ring, and then lost him. He was then attacked by dark-robed men in black masks.”

The beggar remained silent in the pitch-black darkness.

“So?” Okin asked.

“Ah, where are my manners?” The vagabond said. “Thank you very much for collecting all of this, Okin. It is very eye-opening, please continue. Is there anything else that you have to say?”

“Uhm--- I’m afraid that this group--- or someone for that matter, will kill me. It is not a secret that I am staying in the visiting complex, and I am afraid my life is at risk,” Okin said.

“Well,” the beggar replied. “If you’d like, you can stay at my home for a few nights.”

Okin’s eyebrows furrowed. “B-But, you’re a---“

“C’mon, don’t be rude to a man who offers you a place to stay! It’s nothing fancy, but it is my home!” 

Okin was at a loss for words.

“Well, do you want to stay at my home or not?” The beggar asked.

“Is this--- this is the home you’re referring to, right? The gap between these two abandoned houses?” 

The man chuckled. “Of course not! You think I’d shiver out here in the cold all night?”

“Well then, where is your home?” Okin asked.

“Right here, of course!” The man laughed.

Okin’s jaw dropped; the beggar’s vague ramblings had just grown into insanity.

Then, he heard the sound of scraping metal, and what sounded like an extremely heavy coin dropping to the floor. 

“Well c’mon, follow my voice. Make sure your foot catches the ladder, you wouldn’t want to fall down!” 

Okin stepped forward carefully, focusing his eyes onto the ground below. He heard a pattering sound, and the beggar’s voice grew quieter and quieter. 

Okin stepped over where the beggar was slumped over previously; he was gone, with only the scrunched-up blanket remaining on the ground. And where he was seated before, was a dark hole, with a very dim light emitting several feet below, underground.

“Well c’mon, come down from there!” The beggar shouted. “You wanna actually get some sleep, right?”

Okin carefully placed his foot down into the hole, and stopped as his heel pushed onto the rung of the ladder. Slowly, he set his other foot on the rung below, and began descending down into the dark hole.

“Oh, please pull the cap back on,” the beggar said. “That large metal plate.”

Okin reached his arm back over to the surface, and his hand met the cold metal. He pulled the plate towards him, making a squeaking sound as the sewer cap scraped against the concrete ground. He pulled the cap over his head, it sealed over the pothole with a snap.

The only source of light was a dim candle at the edge of the room, yet strangely, Okin could see quite clearly. The room was next to empty, beside two blankets spread across the concrete floor. It was simply a grey box. Descending down the ladder, he nervously reached his foot down to prod at the ground, and feeling a hard surface, stepped off. 

“I am sorry,” the beggar said, sitting atop one of the blankets. “It’s not much, but it’s surely safe.”

Now, underground, alone, Okin trusted the man; there was kindness in his voice. He laid down on the unoccupied blanket, the only thing between his back and the rough floor. Despite the beggar’s revolting appearance, the smell was rather plain. Or maybe he had just gotten used to it.

The bearded man smiled, laying down on his own mat.

“I tried what you told me,” Okin said. “I tried to find out if someone was hiding something from me while talking to them. But I didn’t feel anything. I think I’m not just very good at reading people.”

“Did you get near them? The closer you get to someone, if you put a hand on their shoulder even, the better you can sense their emotions,” the man replied.

“I did. There was still nothing,” Okin responded, staring up at the concrete roof. 

“Ah,” the man replied. “But a man of your young age, at such a high ranking, must have many other talents.”

Okin snorted. “Luck, maybe, if you would call that one. That’s probably the only reason I’m alive and here right now.”

The vagabond raised a bushy eyebrow.

“When I was at the church, listening in on the conspirators’ conversation, a group of Rothars walked by, guards. They were probably serving the conspirators, and if I were caught, who knows what would happen to me. It was too late to run, so I just shrivelled up into a ball and hid, praying they wouldn’t see me. They walked right in front of my path, but somehow, they didn’t notice me.” 

Nodding, the beggar turned away from Okin, now laying on his back.

Okin’s eyes adjusted further to the dimness of the room, and now he could see a small bug resting upside down on the roof. “I don’t think it’s luck, actually. Or at least I hope not. I think it’s faith.”
