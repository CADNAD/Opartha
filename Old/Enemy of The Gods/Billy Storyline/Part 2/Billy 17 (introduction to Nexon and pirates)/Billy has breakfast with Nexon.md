Billy expected to be forced to scrub the deck for countless hours, to be shoved into a little closet reeking of fish and shit, and to be stripped, humiliated, and beaten. That was the way of pirates, or so he’d been told since he was a kid.

Instead, after telling the Captain his name, his hands hadn’t been tied and he’d been basically allowed to roam the deck freely, and he and the others slept among the pirates, in a dorm below deck that was surprisingly clean and well-kept. The lot of them weren’t exactly *friendly,* well, except the Captain, whose smile hadn’t left the whole night, but they weren’t mean, either.

Billy stayed awake though, staring endlessly at the ceiling. Soon enough the sound of men snoring completely filled the room and he couldn’t catch a wink even if he wanted to, and even if he shut his ears, how could anyone sleep with the rumbling, swaying, and bouncing of the ship?

One question stayed on his mind: what had happened? One second, he and the others were awaiting their demise on their own sinking ship, and the next, they were on board that of another. He hadn’t been able---no, he hadn’t wanted to--- talk to the others since the bizarre teleportation.

There was a firm knocking on the trapdoor above the ladder. It clicked open and bright sunlight poured in. 

“Breakfast time, everybody!” The Captain’s cheerful voice shouted.

The dozen or so pirates in this dormitory groaned awake, rolling off of their beds. Billy followed them up the ladder and onto deck, shielding his eyes as he stepped up.

The pirates passed several tables rooted onto the deck, and underneath the wooden awning\[ Confused about what this is exactly\] of one of the cabins was a rotund, black metal pot, several shorter stacks of ceramic bowls next to it. Out from that cabin, several other pirates poured out, and Billy picked out Benjamin and the others.

“Oh, wait,” Billy jumped, feeling something on his shoulder. It was the captain’s hand. 

“Stupid me. I don’t think they’ll be enough food including you and your friends. Ah, but no matter. The *ShaoRi* has the best kitchen and chefs anyway,” he winked a shimmering green eye.

“You three! The new catch!” The Captain whistled to Benjamin and the others. “Come down here, I’ll get you a special meal, it’ll be just one second.”

Benjamin and the others wiggled past the line of pirates, stepping down onto the deck where Billy and the captain were.\[ Geography confusion. Is this supposed to be stepping up?\]

The Captain smiled---and then zoomed off so fast, Billy couldn’t even see his body streak through the air. It appeared as though he bounded upwards almost *over* the ship, but it was such a blur.

Mouth agape, Billy scrambled over to the side of the deck that the Captain had hopped off. Five other ships swayed up and down the violent waves as they trailed the massive flagship.

Four forceful gusts of wind blew across his back, and Billy stumbled backwards, almost falling over the ship’s rail. 

He felt a gentle tug on both his shoulders stabilizing him upwards. The Captain’s smiling face greeted him; the man’s unexpectedly shiny white teeth were almost more eerie than his crew’s nasty, chipped yellows. Wobbling on the table in front of them were four bowls, filled with a hearty red soup. The Captain released Bilyly back on his feet and opened his hand to the table.

“Enjoy!” The Captain bowed.

“Y-y-you---,” Billy’s lips couldn’t even meet together to speak. The group stared at the Captain with wide eyes. Billy finally realized how they had ‘teleported’ onto the ship.

“Yes? Is there something else you need, Billy?” The Captain brushed off his maroon inner vest, though Billy could see no filth. In fact, both it and his dark leather coat looked as if they had been bought yesterday, much unlike the torn wear of the other pirates. He was obviously the authority here, and despite his clownish demeanor, the roughened pirates knelt to him. It was probably because even without his crew, this weird man could likely kill them all in the blink of an eye.

“Thank you, sir,” Billy bowed his neck.

“Ah, what’s with the formalities?” The Captain raised a perfect eyebrow. “Oh, I suppose in all my running around, I never got to introduce myself! Funny, how I can do so much and still forget the crucial,” the Captain chuckled. “I am Captain Kiatus, the leader of this humble fleet, and the last great Pirate Lord.”\[ This should be earlier, or should warrant a different reaction because someone already introduced him at some point\]

He did a stylish flick of the arm, and a red, silky sleeve pushed out past his fingers. Billy nodded, and the Captain further gestured to the bowls, smiling. Benjamin and Allia had already started to dig in, but Damian just ogled around at the rushing waters.

“Wait---,” Damian’s eyes focused on the Captain. “Kiatus--- like, the ocean?”

Kiatus chuckled. “Yes, just like the ocean! Ever vast, with endless possibilities!”

“And secrets,” Benjamin chuckled. “I am sailor, but actually afraid of ocean.”

“Uhm, sure,” Kiatus smiled weakly\[ 2021-04-27, 6:37 PM

Perhaps change this beat- adverb and may not be clear enough to show Nexon’s nervousness with secrets\]. 

“Wait---we’re on the Leviathi Strait! This should be impossible to sail for prolonged periods!” Damian shouted.

“Impossible?” The Captain laughed. “Then how could we be doing it right now? ”

“I---It *shouldn’t* be possible---“

“Everything is possible with a full crew of Heralds. Ah, I forgot to mention that,” Kiatus scowled. “Since you’re not Heralds, you’re probably just gonna have to play prisoner until we find...something else to do with ya.”

“We’re actually all Heralds,” Allia said in between slurps.\[ Might be out of character here for her to say this?\]

“Oh, excellent!” Kiatus’ eyes brightened. “That is wonderful, I’m sure in no time at all---“

“But---why would you even subject yourself to this?” Damian interrupted. “The current is so extreme, there’s no one even here to raid!”

The Captain’s smile vanished, and he trotted towards Damian, who hid behind his mop of hair and the bowl of soup.  Kiatus’ posture was still open, almost regal, but his hips slunk backwards, and his gait was off-balanced and uncomfortably timed; one massive curved step with the right, followed by a little push with the left.\[ Not sure what his conveys\]

The Captain’s arm fell on the table next to Damian, and his head slumped backwards so he spoke to the sky.

“I find that people indulge in not what is good, or beautiful, but only in that which fits with what they have already done before. It is like room with thousands of puzzle pieces, all from different sets, allowing the completion of dozens of wondrous puzzles. But instead of fitting together the vast array, developing a multitude of beautiful puzzles, they only look around for pieces that immediately fit the few they have in hand, endlessly searching the piles for only three or four that perfectly mould into what they already know.

“Most men wish to only live one life, and many to not even complete the one they own. But I, oh, now that I’ve opened myself to all, I wish I had an endless amount of lives to complete the endless puzzles,” Kiatus’ watery eyes twinkled. 

Allia and Benjamin exchanged confused glances.

Kiatus became a blur and zoomed over to the side of the deck, waving his arms out to the rushing waters of the Leviathi Strait. He shouted back at the prisoners at the centre of the ship.

“After a while, all the major oceans start to look quite the same. But here--- in between the stretch of icy mountains and wild jungle--- there is true, unique adventure!”

He let out a childish howl to the seas, followed by a trailing laughter.

“You see, most pirates are outlaws. Most would actually rather find booze then gold because they can actually use it! But finding gold, oh, it still has its wonders, but not only because it’s shiny, no, that gets quite old, quite fast,” Kiatus flinched, and in an instant, he was back, his nose inches away from Damian’s.

“You see, my friend, it is the *thrill* of piracy that we are all after. Most the men here are GaoLeian. They could’ve received a pardon from the Empire, and become part of the navy, or even a privateer to hunt down their fellow men. But no. They stayed *pirates*, because of the thrill,” Kiatus smiled, stretching his arms out to the sky. “All around us is gold. It may not look it--- but it is. The Strait---the Strait is the heart of adventure, the heart of a *pirate*.”

Kiatus stumbled backwards with the shake of the sea, still maintaining a wide grin. Several of the tables around him---who Billy hadn’t even known were listening, clapped. There was already red soup spilled across the deck and surfaces that wasn’t there upon Billy’s arrival.

“Now,” Kiatus stood up straight again. “What type of Heralds might the four of you be?”

“Transportation,” Benjamin said, levitating his bowl in the air with no hands. Kiatus gave a silent applause with his fingers. 

“Radiation,” Allia rested her face against her fist, giving no demo.

“I’m a Creation and a Mind Herald,” Damian said. “Though I am rather inexperienced in both.”

“Ah,” Kiatus raised his eyebrows. “A fellow Dual Herald. That is quite fascinating! I’m curious, where do the lot of you come from, then?\[ Confusing strcture\] I assume it could only be Apathasaw, but I didn’t know many Beisanians left the Empire!”

“Uhm, yes, we from Apathasaw,” Benjamin waved his hands over himself, Billy, and Damian. “She is---,”

“How did you know that I’m Beisanian?” Allia interrupted.

“The silver eyes. I’m not an idiot,” Kiatus laughed. “Just because you don’t have that striking hair doesn’t mean it’s not obvious.”

Allia blushed and covered her face with a slender hand.  “I’m not from Beisan, though. I was born at the Tsuman Monastery.\[ comma, 2021-05-16 8:59 AM

Maybe remove this bc of what happens to Jerel later\]”

“Ah, what a fascinating group!\[ Insert Intillia relationship hint here?\] Oh---I’m so sorry, I keep always getting sidetracked. You, my friend,” Kiatus placed a hand on Billy’s shoulder. “What type of Herald might you be?”

“I’m a Control Herald,” Billy said.

“And a fellow master of Time! And from Apathasaw! You must be quite the gunslinger, then. I’m not so bad myself,” Kiatus laughed, sliding away the left side of his dark jacket. Underneath it was a bandolier holding a long array of bullets with a revolver tucked in at the end.

“I didn’t see one on you, though,” the Captain remarked. “Just an empty holster.”

“Lost it,” Billy said.

“Aw, that is unfortunate. I might be able to get you another, but I suppose I would be going a little *too* far off the deep end if I allowed my prisoners to walk around with loaded guns, on the first day of capture. It’s not a *hard* rule, though, and is certainly subject to change. Oh---and I although I normally rather do without them, we do have *one,* well, yes, hard rule.”

Kiatus’ eyes narrowed, and he pointed a pale finger at the four. “There is no---absolutely none---talking about religion, or Gods, or the like.”

Billy nodded, he’d heard far too much religious rabble from the Athers and the Monastery in the past few weeks. “Sounds like a fine rule to me.”

Kiatus’ cheery laugh returned, and he patted Billy on the back. “Good. It looks like you’re mostly finished your meal, but enjoy the view, my friends!” He spun out to the rapids, and his shouted in a singsong voice,”We will soon sail closer toward the sea, to embark on glorious piracy.”

With a shining smile and a wink, he leapt over the ship’s rail and dashed off over the water to the ships behind.
