Okin awoke. He rolled his neck to the side; the beggar appeared to be still sleeping.

Quietly, he got up. Looking around the dark room, he crawled to the eastern wall, and reached his hands out to feel along the ground. There really was nothing; it was just a plain, empty space.

*How can he survive down here, with nothing? And did he build this, or just discover it? Why would a homeless man build an underground bunker with no purpose?*

“Ah, I see you’re awake,” Okin spun around. The beggar stood before him. Even in the blackened room, he could see the beggar’s dirty teeth smiling at him.

“Good morning,” Okin replied, face red.

“Good morning, Okin,” the beggar laughed, stretching his arms. “You have a nice rest?”

Okin nodded. 

“Good. Because tonight, we’re going to be getting into some action,” the hobo smiled.

Okin froze. The beggar realized he was an *Athe*r, not a Rothar, right?

“What are you talking about?” he said.

“Oh, don’t panic, you won’t be having to fight. If you do well, that is.” The man chuckled.

*First, he makes me fetch information from him, which I risk my hide to do. Granted, it is not because I feel I owe this man anything, but because I desire the truth. Now he is implying I must risk my life?*

“Enough of your nonsense,” Okin said, eyes stern. “Tell me what I have to do.”

The beggar shook his finger. “Just breathe, my friend. It is more fun as a surprise, trust me. And you still have several hours to prepare yourself, to get yourself in the right *state of mind.* You are free to go now, but return to me at sunset tonight. Then, you will find the truth.”

Okin clenched both his teeth and his fist. It was always surprises, always secrets, always beating around the bush with the strange vagabond. Yet, he *had* given Okin promising leads. And both he and Okin knew that the Ather would continue to play his game. 

“Well, at least part of the truth,” the beggar smirked.

“Alright,” Okin said, already beginning his climb up the ladder. “I’ll be here, as long as you promise that you’ll help me find the answers.”

“Oh trust me,” the vagrant laughed. “You’ll get your answers.”

Okin slowly raised the pot cover, checking to see if there was anyone walking along the alley. The coast was clear. Quickly climbing out and putting the cover back on the manhole, Okin looked both ways and began running towards the visiting complex.
