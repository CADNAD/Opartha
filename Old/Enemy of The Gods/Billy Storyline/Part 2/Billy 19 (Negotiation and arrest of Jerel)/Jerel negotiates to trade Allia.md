“So, may I ask \[ iceisnice, 2021-08-23 10:27 PM

Think ab this combined with other chapter- Billy might’ve made too much progress to still have hateful thoughts about allia\]why you’ve been following us?” Kiatus spoke. The two footsteps drew closer to the centre of the ship, ontop of where Billy, Benjamin and Damian crouched.

“I apologize for what probably was very unsettling,” Jerel said. “We were tracking some escaped criminals in an identical Ytthernu-carried vessel as ours. We lost them, but heard an unmistakable shrill of one being tortured, or killed. We happened upon the remnants of a crashed ship, which led back to you and your fleet.”

Kiatus paused, as did his steps.

“And you were looking for information?”

“Well, yes. I assume that you and your fleet were---*involved* in the crash. It deeply saddens me, not just because of the importance of our mission. There are criminals, yes---,” Jerel’s voice raised even higher, “but I am also after my betrothed.”

There was a slam of a heavy door which shook the entire ship, and Billy’s hands instinctively reached to where he thought Damian was, clutching the boy’s thin frame.

“I am *not* your betrothed. Not by choice”

Billy could hear the crew’s attention turn to the back of the ship, where a singular step of poised, sharp footsteps came forward. Even his jaw dropped a little.

“But Allia,” Jerel said. “You made a vow.”

“You know why. You and Taedon all but forced me, but none of that even matters anymore. I have deserted the Monastery, and we both know there is only one thing I can do for them to have me back,” Allia said. “I know that he’s crazy, but I’m surprised *you two* came along.”

“Oh, don’t be so dramatic, my dear. No one ever *forced* you to do anything, and I’m sure if you return with the other three in ropes, promising to marry me and bear lots of children, that they’ll come around,” Jerel replied. Billy could almost hear the smug, cheesy smile in his voice, and it made him want to barf.

“Ah,” Kiatus chimed in. “This is interesting.”

“Well,” there was some venom in Allia’s voice. “I rather you just send them back my severed head than be subject to that torment.”\[ She should maybe be more on the fence about this. She hasn’t really had time to confront her crisis of faith.\]

There was a chuckle among the pirates, notably from Kiatus.

A harsh stomp silenced the pirate’s muttering. “Don’t be like *that* now, dear,” Jerel said, his voice chillingly low.

“Billy,” Billy felt Benjamin’s thick, sweaty hand on his shoulder. “She’s in trouble. We have to help.”

*“*No, no,” Billy held out his arms to block the ladder. “Don’t move.”

“Billy,” Damian said, and Billy felt his brother inching for the rungs. “She did the same for us.”

Billy gritted his teeth. How many times were they going to have this argument? Yes, it was true, Allia had saved them from the rope, but that didn’t mean they were *obliged* to throw themselves into the fire after her! 

“Come on, Allia. You’ve thrown your life away for fools enough as it is. Tell me where they are, and we can return home, and everything will go back to normal,” Jerel said.

There was a long pause, during which Benjamin kept trying to push his giant frame past Billy’s arms. The outlaw struggled not to make too much noise while blocking his friend.

“Jump in the Strait, Jerel,” Allia said. The pirates exploded into a ball of laughter.\[ 2021-05-04, 8:47 PM

Maybe delete this, might ruin serious mood\]

“Billy!” Benjamin hissed. “You know we have to do this. If anything happens to her, you’ll curse yourself for not helping.”

Billy continued to block Benjamin and his brother from the ladder, though his arms shook. There was no way--- she’d really done all of this to protect them?

“After all I’ve done,” Billy could hear Jerel’s laboured breathing, followed by a violent stomp. “I’m sorry, my dear. I know you don’t really mean that. 

“But it did make my insides turn to find the wonderful gift I gave you as the start of our engagement in the room of that heretic,” Jerel’s throat roughened at the word. “And I am having trouble controlling my... vitriol. Your actions really do seem irrational, my dear. Now please, I’d rather things not get violent. Tell me where they are and let’s get going.”

There was an audible groan from above, likely Allia, though it sounded like more than one. The weight of Benjamin’s shoulder released, and Billy silenced his breath, priming his ears. Where had his friend gone? Billy widened his eyes, but it was hopeless, especially with Benjamin’s dark skin. He outstretched his arms again, preparing.

A massive force shoved him aside, and his right side slammed against the floor. 

“I’m sorry, Billy,” Benjy whispered.

“Benjamin? What are you do---

“What is right, Billy. And if you really do have any care in world about justice, you will do too.”

Benjamin climbed up the ladder, and from the tiny stream of light flowing above, Billy could see Damian following behind.

“Damian!” Billy groaned. “Don’t---it’s not safe---“

The hatch flipped open, and a shower of light shone down from the skies above, blinding him after his brother and best friend had stepped up out of hiding.

*Of all the times he chooses not to be a coward.*

“Ah, phew! It was getting difficult to hold my tongue,” Kiatus chuckled. 

“Hold your--- ah, never mind, they are here now,” Jerel said. “Well, it seems everything is wrapping itself up. We’ll be taking them away.”

*No, no, no, no*, Billy thought. He forced himself off the floor, ignoring the burning ache in his back, and seized the bars in front of him with both hands. There was shuffling above, and he pulled himself up the ladder, he couldn’t miss a second.

“Well, they are technically *our* prisoners, so we’d like some compensation,” Kiatus said. “Do you have anything---*special* to offer us?”

“Of course. The Tsuman Monastery has a prodigious collection of valuable resources that I’m sure we can work something out. Don’t try it, Allia,\[ This feel like it should accompany an action\]” Jerel said, the pride in his voice dancing above Billy’s ears. “We both want them to get a fair trial, don’t we?”

The girl grunted, and there was more hurried steps. Billy’s fingers wrapped around the rung three from the top, still invisible to those above even with the open hatch. He tucked his legs in tight to a bar below and tightened the muscles in his back. 

*You can’t let them have him.*

He squinted out into the blinding light above, and from within, readied another muscle---the control of Time.

“Wait,” the snark in Jerel’s tone fleeted. “Where’s---”

Billy thrust his legs upward, pushing himself through the narrow opening. Time slowed as he flew into the open air, his body swirling around in a semi-circle. A mass of pirates stood just below him under the massive sails, all huddled in a group, or no, two; they had parted for Allia, who’s glowing veins were clear even in the daylight. As his body spun, he saw Benjamin in a fighting stance, but unarmed. His eyes finally turned upon the group at the front of the ship: Jerel’s expression was still curious, none of them had had the time to register Billy’s ambush yet.  On either sides of him were Evelyn---Benjamin’s Dakung at the Monastery---and another armoured man. 

Slowing Time this much taxed him immensely, and he felt the fog creeping into his mind. Still, he forced his eyes to find two figures: a smiling Kiatus, who stood separated from the three intruders on the side of the ship, and his own brother, who stood just in front of Jerel, shaking. Even when he was brave, he somehow still surrendered to cowardice.

Billy reached the apex of his jump and was forced out of Time Slow, lest he suck away his own consciousness. The Crystal had been fueling him, but it felt strangely barren at this point and never shook as it had before. He crashed down into a squat, feet on opposite sides of the open latch.

A darkened barrel pointed at the spot between Jerel’s widened eyes. \[ 2021-05-06, 3:46 PM

Might have to reconstruct this---why wouldn’t Billy just kill Jerel?\]

“Don’t you fucking dare lay a slimy finger on my fucking brother.”

The other two Heralds snapped awake, raising their hands, and a stream of water flowed up from the Strait and pointed at Billy, alongside a mass of hovering cannonballs. His head whirred; being on a rocky boat was enough, but being absolutely drained of Time to the point that he felt the barrenness was another.

“Okay, okay,” Jerel raised his hands in surrender, stepping out from behind Damian. “We’ve come for fair negotiation, and there is no need for violence.”

Jerel shared a look with his fellows, and Evelyn and the other lowered the cannonballs and the sea.\[ Don’t think Space Heralds can move \] 

“There is no *fair negotiation*,” Billy said, motioning for Damian to come closer. “You’re not taking any of us.”

“Hm,” Jerel stepped in front of Damian, stopping the boy with his arm\[ Geography makes sense when I go backwards, but doesn’t make sense going forward. I.e, you don’t understand the geography clearly till this point.\]. “I’m sure we can come to some agreement. How about---we’ll go back and tell the Pajuongs that Allia had a turn of heart and together we hunted down the three heretics? So you three get to go free, and she gets to return to a peaceful, married life.” 

“You know that they might not buy that, and whether it’ll even be enough. You have absolutely *no* idea what they’re going to say,” Allia scowled. 

Biting his lip, Billy lowered his sights. He could dump the girl off with these crazies and be done with it? 

“I think if we do that,” Jerel’s eyes met Billy’s, “everybody wins. Isn’t that right?”

“No,” Damian turned and faced Jerel. “Like my brother said, you’re not taking any of us.”

A wealth of pride washed over Billy before being drenched by fear. He reached deep to slow Time, but it pushed back against him, only fogging his brain. In his weakness, Jerel snatched Damian and pulled him in, pointing his shiny Edgar 38 to the boy’s head. 

“Put it down or I’ll blow his brains out,” Jerel said. Billy set his weapon on the floor as the Jerel’s accomplices raised theirs--- water and throwing knives respectively---at Benjamin and Allia.

“Now if you don’t want to be agreeable, I’m personally sanguine to go through with our original plan. So I guess you couldn’t be any more wrong,” Jerel grinned down at a trembling Damian. “I’m taking *all* of you. I’m finally going to have you, Allia, and a whole lot of glory to go along with it.”
