“Follow me!” Okin yelled, turning down the road towards the centre of The Citadel. 

“Where are we going?” Gendro yelled, catching up to Okin. The bright sun had allowed him to absorb enough light to seal the wound completely, and gave him enough strength to push past the pain and keep up with the Ather.

“To the only other ally we have in this city,” Okin said, panting. “Trenton.”

Okin stopped to take a breath, nervously checking his six. After a ten-second breather, the Ather gave Gendro a nod, and the two men continued off towards the Cathedrals and the Seat at the centre of the city.

“How are we going to get to him, though? I don’t think you want to be sending another messenger up to the Seat with Aldwin there,” Gendro said.

“Trenton is an Olitheon Dedicant. He is sure to be in the Cathedral when he is not in meetings at the Seat.”

The massive Light Crystal of Aredal beamed from hundreds of feet above, putting Gendro’s to shame. But Okin wasn’t headed for Aredal’s Cathedral today, rather The Cathedral ere Olitheon, which was to the left of Aredal, facing to the South.

“Here,” Okin said, and they turned into one of the many circular roads, sprinting down it until they reached the northern main road, turning right again.

The statue of Olitheon towered above the street, one hand rested along his chin in a thoughtful position and another outstretched to the world as if it was merely an art piece he was displaying. The beautifully cut stone displayed a tall man with short hair. and a clean, handsome face. His expression was unique from the other three--- his seriousness the opposite of his smiling brother, but more thoughtful than that of Aredal or Intillia’s.

Unlike many other Athers, Okin had a deep knowledge of all of the Four, not just his Dedication. As a youth, dreaming of becoming an Ather, he actually thought he would Dedicate himself to Olitheon due to his own scholarly nature, but was later enthralled by Aredal’s focus on Truth and Justice in the world. 

But facing the statue now, all he could think about was the short excerpt he had gotten of the supposed Fourth Book of Nexon.

*I stand here today, not because of choice, but lack thereof. He has left me without option. Only he could pressure me to stand against him, only he knows my personality well enough to force my hand. Only my brother.*

Was the passage really about the two that stood on the left and right of Aredal--- the two brothers who were the shining examples of different personalities in harmony?

Okin shook his head. Once again, these were questions for another time. He was in danger, he needed to focus on the task at hand. 

Like Aredal’s Cathedral, the entrance was guarded by a high-ranking Devinar, who wore shining armour with gilded cuffs and bracers. He held a long halberd at his side, and two steel-armoured Rothars stood at attention to his right and left, all wielding halberds. 

The Devinar stepped forward. “Hello, High Ather, welcome to the Cathedral ere Olitheon. Why do you wish to enter the Cathedral?”

“I---,” Okin paused. “I am looking for Impalias Trenton.”

“I understand,” the Devinar nodded, stepping aside for the two men to enter. “May you find whatever Knowledge that you seek.”

Okin smiled, and the two men entered.

The Cathedral wasn’t nearly as busy as it was just days before when Okin had been searching for information surrounding the supposed Fourth Book of Nexon. The clerks weren’t present; during a few hours of the day, the Cathedral was reserved for worship and prayer, and no checkouts were allowed.

In fact, the place was almost empty, save for a lone man with a purple cap and pellegrina who knelt in front of the endless twirling bookshelf which stretched to floors above. 

Trenton.

“At least he’s here,” Okin whispered to Gendro as they quietly strolled towards the praying Impalias. 

“Impalias Trenton,” Okin said, and the Impalias looked behind himself to see the two men. 

“Okin! What might you be doing here?” Trenton said.

“I’m afraid it is somewhat an emergency,” Okin said. “I have been investigating a strange group that I believe is trying to manipulate The Citadel, and they attacked me in my room today. If not for Gendro, I would’ve been dead.”

Trenton’s lip quivered as Okin continued. “I feel bad for coming to you again, as you have already done so much for me. But you are the only one I can trust, and I am under your command. If it is your will, I would like to request a secretive place within The Citadel for my Rothar and I to stay.”

Trenton turned back to the bookshelf. “Why? Why would anyone seek to shatter what we have built?”

“Not shatter, I’m afraid,” Okin said. “Control from within.”

Trenton spun back around, his eyes wide and staring directly at Okin’s. “So you are saying that it is members of The Citadel who are plotting against it?”

“I’m afraid so.”

Trenton shook his head, closing his eyes tightly. “Oh Olitheon, please give me the Wisdom I require to move forward, and the Knowledge to make decisions that will further your will.”

The Impalias looked back to Okin. “I do not have any places of secret where I could hide you. But, I do have an idea, if you are willing to--- willing to hide in plain sight.”

“At this point,” Okin said. “We’d be happy to try anything.”

“Well then. I will hide you among the Rothar trainees,” Trenton said. 

Gendro shrugged, but Okin shivered. It was easy enough for Gendro, he was already a trained Rothar, and an Absorption Herald. But Okin had both the build and the mind of a scholar, of a preacher. If he had to convincingly stay amongst the Rothars, it would be a sweat.

But he really didn’t have any other option. Was he more afraid of being a weak link, or being killed?

“Thank you, Impalias Trenton. As the timing is crucial---“

“Yes, yes, we’ll go now,” Trenton laughed. “Follow me.”

The three men turned to leave the endless wealth of Knowledge within the walls of the Cathedral.
