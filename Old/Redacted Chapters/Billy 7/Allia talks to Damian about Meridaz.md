Home. They were so close to being home. Allia pulled her hair back as she looked herself over in mirror. How long had it been since she had been home. Nearly two years now, two long years. Silently, she picked at a small scar under her chin, the girl who had left home knew so little, had so much hope. *It’s not as if you yourself know what much more now,* she thought to herself as she stared at her reflection. 

A knock came at the cabin door and Allia yelled for the person to let themselves in. In a swift motion, Allia finished the bun and pinned it was a silver rod which was engraved with tessellating gold patterns. 

“Captain,” she said with a curt nod as he bowed to her. Unlike the common sailors, Captain Herdro wore the long officer’s coat which buttons at the sides of the torso and had ran to his thighs. As a sign of respect, Allia had been offered a similar coat to wear, rather than the common clothing he had provided the others. 

“We’ll be arriving soon, your presence would be much appreciated,” he said, rising from his bow. 

“Of course captain, a small price to pay for your hospitality. I do hope the officer’s quarters you were relegated to were not particularly harsh?” 

“It was not, Kadonsong. I do wish I hadn’t been forced to part with the bottle though.” A slight smile creeped onto his face. It was always interesting seeing how different Kurizhongs reacted to her requests. While there was never grumbling, some would drop to their knees waiting on her whim, while some like Captain Herdro had more, well, *personality*. 

“I ensure you captain, if we cross paths again, I shall repay you ten fold for the bottle.” Allia closed a small leather bound book on the table and slid the thin book into her pocket.  

“Have you ever been to Meridaz before?” Allia rounded the desk and stood by the door.

“I don’t think I have, Kadonsong,” the man replied as he pushed the door open. 

Allia gave the man a smile before stepping out to see her home, “I do hope you get to stay longer than to simply collect your payments.” 

Allia’s breath caught in her throat, and for a moment, she was the who girl stared as her home drew away from her for the first time. Yet, painted against the orange backdrop of the setting sun, the island of Meridaz appeared more beautiful than she could have ever described. The ship sailed in south, the only direction from which the island broke the turbulent currents between the continents of Krinosas and Wreathward. The island was around thirty kilometres long on this side, and stretched twenty kilometres deep. From the maps Allia had seen as a child, the island held a fairly rectangular shape with the corners rounded off. Buildings crowded the coast line around the dock and blocked away the views of the green interior which rose in terraced hills toward the main feature of the island, Mount Theiadon. The mountain rose several thousand meters above the sea, and was a cracked brown stone dotted with patches of green. All along the side, windows and balconies dotted the stone at irregular intervals and elevations. Staring at the rising mountain, she wondered if her mother could see her. *I’m almost home, mother. Only a little while longer.* 

“It’s amazing,” a voice said to her side. Damian stood against the railing, peering out over the water at the island. His hair flew wildly in the wind, obscuring his face. 

“It is, isn’t it?” Allia asked. The women took a step and leaned against the railing next to Damian. He shied away from her a little as she did, sliding a few inches away from her. Though he had been the most friendly of the three, he still seemed wary, or perhaps scared of Allia. 

“It’s nothing like they described it in the books, it’s so much... bigger,” Damain said. 

“Most miss how much farmland the island requires, even crown reports fail to highlight that fact.” Damian seemed to nod in silent agreement. It was a common response for the man, simple nods and no protests. She had met many men like him over the years. Ones who went through life attempting to be as agreeable as possible.

“There are many things most miss about the island. Forces willing, I’ll get to show you some of those things.” Damian smiled.

“Sure, if Billy doesn’t run first,” he said.

Allia stifled a laugh. “Yes, he does seem like the type to leave even after all this. But I’m sure all three of you have enough sense to listen first, don’t you?”

She had hoped for a solid affirmation of his commitment by Damian, but the man only shrugged. “Can’t ever say with him.”

The wind whipped past both of them as a bell rung up above. “Kandonsong,” the captain said from behind her. 

Allia gave Damian a wry smile and turned to the captain. She was home.
