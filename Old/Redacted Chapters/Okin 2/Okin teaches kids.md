“The Gods, through their Sacrifice, gave an example of how we can use our gifts, and talents, and even our personalities to help others, and the world. People like I, and your parents, try to look to the Gods and be like them, but we aren’t perfect,” Okin smiled. “But we try our best, so that you can understand how to be good from our example. When you do good things, it also sets an example for others.”

There was a rush of cool breeze, and many of the children watching vigilantly in the pews turned around. A stout, bearded man stood in the double doorway, smiling, gently nudging a small girl with auburn hair forward, who held her father’s hand.

“I’m so sorry we’re late. Celia is just very shy,” the father said.

Okin stepped down from the chancel, smiling at the newcomers, and waving them forward.

“It is alright. I’m just happy she is joining us,” he said.

The father nodded with a smile, kneeling down to his daughter who crumpled into his leg.

“It’s okay, sweetie,” he said. “High Ather Okin is a very nice man. Don’t you enjoy his speeches when we come to church?”

The girl nodded slowly.

“Go on then,” the father said. “Daddy will be back in an hour.”

The little girl shook her head. 

Okin crouched down, eye level with the girl’s green eyes.

“It’s okay,” he said softly. “When I was a little boy, I was scared of being away from my father too.”

The dad smiled.

“Now I’ve been away from him for years. But when I see him again, I’m all the more happier. And look, you have lots of friends here,” Okin pointed to a pew a few rows in front of them were two other young girls knelt over, looking at the newcomer. They waved.

The little girl stepped forward from her father, and lightly waved back.

“They want you to join. Do you want to go sit with them?”

The little girl stood unmoved for a moment, and then nodded.

“Come on,” Okin smiled, taking the little girl’s hand and guiding her to the aisle where her friends were.

“Thank you, Ather,” the father said, before leaving.

Okin walked back up to the front of the church. The newcomer was laughing with her friends, and he smiled. 

He opened his mouth to recommence his homily, but stopped; a small boy in the front row had raised his hand.

“Yes, Paolin?” Okin asked, gesturing to the boy.

“My father has a tattoo, like the one you have, but a--- a different shape. And no colour,” Paolin said. “Will I get one of those?”

“Ah,” Once again, Okin couldn’t help himself from smiling. “One day, you will choose which tattoo you get, whichever of the Four you Dedicate yourself to. You all remember the Four, correct?”

All the kids nodded, and a few even yelled “Of course!”

Okin laughed, moving to the centre of the aisle, in the middle of the pews the children occupied.  

“This is my tattoo,” he held out his palm, where there was a black Four-pointed star, with a thin golden triangle at the top, pointing farther upward.

“The symbol in the centre displays my Dedication, and the four-pointed star is the symbol of Aredal. Everyone can choose their Dedication at any age, but you must choose yours if you wish to become an Ather, like me. The golden triangle, that shows that I have shown my Dedication especially in Truth, one of the three main values of Aredal.”

“Only Athers and Rothars can get coloured tattoos, but everyone can receive a black one by showing their Dedication in each of the three values of their God,” Okin turned back to the boy who asked the question, smiling. “In fact, your father received the proof of his Dedication to Truth from me.”

The little girl who had came late cautiously raised her hand from the back row. Okin gestured to her with a smile.

“My-My daddy told me that---he tells me about all of the Four, like you do, before I go to sleep. I-I want to be like Nexon, he is the nicest and always helps out other people.”

Okin’s cheeks warmed and his smile grew.  “Yes, Nexon showed us how to truly be Selfless, and how to express our Gratitude and Joy to light up not only our own lives, but the lives of others.  I have many great friends who are Dedicants of Nexon.”

The Ather continued to speak with the children, and later on they played games to make the learning more fun.

Around an hour later, there was a knocking on the door and the parents lined up at the back of the church, receiving many excited hugs and kisses from their children.

A young boy with black hair ran up to Okin before greeting his parents. 

“B-but, Ather Okin, why would Tregale and D-Deionis, why would they attack the people, and the Gods, since they are good and were friends?” 

“Ah,” Okin said. “Tregale and Deionis, they came from the Darkness, which seeks to destroy the other Four. It is--- it is hard for us to understand evil. They pretended to be friends, but they always wanted destruction.”

The little boy stared up with wide eyes.

Okin smiled. “I know it is very difficult to understand. You’ll learn more as you grow up, and I am always willing to answer questions. But I think your parents want to see you now.”

The dark-haired boy turned, and threw himself into the arms of his father and mother.

Okin smiled, shaking the hands of many of the parents, and waving goodbye to their children.

After everyone had left, he grabbed his leather satchel off the front pew, brushing the dust off the golden symbol of Aredal at the front, the same four-pointed star on the palm of his hand. 

Gendro’s carriage was already parked in front of the church building, and the Rothar leant against the its side, smirking.

“You done playing with the children yet?” He asked.

“I don’t think so. I believe I have to babysit one on the ride to Metheno,” Okin grinned.

The Rothar laughed, hopping into the driver’s seat, and the two men rode off, back towards Okin’s hometown.
