After a long while running, the cowboy had finally reached his destination. The once seemingly endless road that kept continuing over the horizon sloped downwards into a grassy hill.

And at the bottom of that hill, between the four stone pillars an iron gates, the dead of Metheno laid in their graves.

Billy showed Damian his watch--- 07:49, they were just a few minutes late. That was probably a good thing; the attendees had already gathered in the centre of the cemetery, dressed in all-black. They wouldn’t pay attention to Billy’s arrival.

*I just wanted it to be you and me, but it doesn’t matter. Ten years, dad. I’m sorry I didn’t come sooner, but I know you were a sucker for round numbers, so I thought this would be a good one.* 

As Billy strutted down the hill, his eyes watered. It was a humble procession; the two stone pillars on either side of the gap that Billy walked through, a clear, centred line of sight between himself and his destination. The chirping birds, usually a needless annoyance, were the choir to Billy’s ceremonial march.

He heard sound of galloping horses in his mind, as if they were leading him to his destination, magical Pegasi gloriously making way for his reunification.

“Stop right there! You’re under arrest for the murder of Lionos Henry Gruissem!” 

Billy’s euphoric trance was interrupted by the boisterous voice. Towering atop the hill stood six lovely couples, or no, threesomes: six men on six horses, carrying six muskets. Their muskets pointed down on Billy. They were an invading army who had breached the enemy lines and had their weapons pointed into the trenches at the one helpless remaining soldier. 

Billy stood in shock. *How did they find us?* 

Billy didn’t know what to do, so he did what he always knew to do when he didn’t know what to do: he slowed things down. 

And when you slow things down, you often find what you’re looking for.

Hidden behind the tall legs of the horses was a short, stout man with a small nest of thin white hair and a wrinkled face. Mr. Cantas, the man they had visited just the day before.\[ 2021-01-18, 6:35 AM

Billy pulled out his gun and aimed it between the legs of the horses, pointing it at the head of the bald white man.

“Billy, no!" Damian leaped and tackled Billy to the ground. The revolver slid out of Billy’s hand, tumbling down the hill.

“Grab them! And get that toy musket, or whatever that thing is!" the front man yelled, and the other guards chuckled, planting their boots on the ground. Three of the men hustled over, one headed straight to grab the revolver while the other two pointed their muskets at the two scrambling men. 

Billy shoved Damian off his chest, and was greeted by the muzzle of the musket in his face. 

“Stand up and put your hands behind your back,” the guard commanded.

Billy and Damian complied, and then two of the other guards came over, grabbing their arms and tying rope around their wrists. The rough rope etched into Billy’s skin.

“Get moving," the guard pushed Billy up the hill, and the tied-up men began walking. The guards got back on their horses, ready to tug him and Damian towards their demise. Billy got one last look towards the graveyard where his father laid to rest, the very father that he was accused of murdering all those years ago.
