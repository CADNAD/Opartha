He came to see him. After ten years, he thought it’d be safe. 

There was the same look of recognition in Billy’s eyes, and it was confirmed by the drop of his jaw. Thoughts and memories flooded Okin’s mind; he had blocked himself from pondering Billy’s fate for his own sanity, and it had been successful almost to the point that he had forgotten about him. 

Okin marched closer to the group as the soldiers remounted themselves. Doing his best to ignore Billy, Okin addressed the soldiers, Gendro at his side.

“Is there a problem here? We heard the commotion from the cemetery.”

The guard, noticing the Ather, straightened his back and dusted off his shoulder plate. His shocked expression morphed into a proud smile. “Ah, Ather, you’d be happy to know that these men we apprehended are actually the murderers of Lionos Gruissem. I’m not sure of the extent of your knowledge on the history of Metheno, but that event shook the population and left the city in social and political turmoil for years.”

“I grew up here, sir,” Okin smiled softly. “And I had actually just finished the Half Decadem ceremony of Lionos Gruissem, and yes, his death was an unmatched tragedy.” 

The guard’s face flushed, and it was clear his squadmates held back childish grins. Billy squirmed, inspecting Okin, but quickly returned to docility as the guards’ attention was drawn away from their leader.

“Anyway,” the squad leader spoke up, “Then you would be even more delighted to know we are taking them for a public execution in the town square, which is long overdue.” The guard’s cheeks paled again and his prideful beam returned.

*Execution? Without a trial?* Okin looked to Billy, unsure of whether his concern showed on his face. The man’s neck was craned and his back was hunched, but his eyes burned and his teeth grounded. Okin looked to the other man, thin and tame, almost to a point of looking depressed. It had to be Damian. The night Billy disappeared, Damian was never seen again, and the two were always close.

Sure, Okin knew they were probably guilty. They had clear motives, and the murder was sloppy, like it was planned by two children. Perhaps it was the fact that they grew up together, but Okin didn’t want to see Billy hanged. At least not without a fair trial. 

Okin’s eyes widened as he realized that his God had already answered his prayers. The night before he travelled to Metheno, he had hoped for an opportunity to show his Dedication to Aredal’s Justice and Bravery. Not even a week later, it had been granted to him in the most unlikely form.

“That is against the doctrine of Moden Versalism, and contradictory to our laws on Justice,” Okin said. “I thought you would know better to take this route of action in front of a High Ather.”

Okin cringed inside, his mind leading to the first place it always would: doctrine. Values 3:12 reads, *Do not be arrogant, or present your class, name, or rank as an argument, for this is the argument of the man who is wrong.* He shook his thoughts. The Gods valued humility, but they also valued Justice---which is why they made their Sacrifice. Perhaps Okin would have to bend one value to uphold another.

The guard’s face reddened again, and this time, the other soldiers stayed silent, their eyes gluing to anything beside the Ather’s. “I-I apologize, High Ather. We will take them to the High Court in Caldoor, where a trial will be held.” 

Sweat grew from Okin’s scalp. *If they do go to Caldoor, and that is still a big if--- I’ll never be able to see the trial, and won’t have the opportunity to uphold Justice and show my Bravery.* Okin knew it wasn’t his duty to see the trial--- in fact, a crime of this nature was supposed to be brought to a High Court--- but seeing Billy after all these years had reignited his curiosity. He had to understand why Billy did it--- or if he really even did. And he had to use this opportunity to prove his Dedication.

“No. As you said, this issue is important to the people of Metheno,” Okin replied. “You will take them to the local church, and the trial will happen there, open for the people to see.”

The guard nodded obediently. Okin held in a sigh of relief--- it technically wasn’t in his jurisdiction to command these guards, but travelling a mile to the local church was much less strenuous then babysitting two miscreants all the way to Caldoor, and an appeal to a man’s sloth is often a strong appeal.

The guards turned their horses to face the main road, and through the pivoting legs was another figure--- short and stout. The horses cleared their way for another familiar face--- his father.

He smiled, and Okin knew it was a symbol of his pride. The Ather rushed in, hugging him. 

“Dad, what are you doing here?” Okin knew the answer--- he had come down to attend the Half Decadem ceremony. 

“These two murderers came into my house yesterday, like some kind of sick stunt, thinking I wouldn’t recognize them," Okin’s father shouted, pointing towards the tied up men. Arm around his back, Okin pulled his father away from the crowd.  

“But how did you?” Okin whispered. “Even I didn’t really recognize him--- I only knew it was him because of what he said and how he was arrested coming to the cemetery, on the Half Decadem of all days.”

Okin’s father didn’t bother to match his son’s quiet volume. “I saw that watch--- only Lionos had a watch like that. It was one of the most expensive possessions that went missing, because that dirty thief loved money more than his own father.”

At that remark, Billy lunged forward, his teeth gnarling, as he screamed in a bestial voice. “Fuck you, old man!” 

Billy, the wild dog, was soon pulled back by his new owners----the guards, by a virtual leash--- the muskets. Okin stepped back in between his father and Billy, Gendro once again at his side.

Okin commanded the guards once again. “You will go with Rothar Gendro here to the church. I need to finish this ceremony, and then I will take my father back to his home. You will tell the local Athers of the situation, and I will return to make sure you do.”

The guards nodded with the same passive obedience. Gendro sighed, rolling his eyes. Okin’s short time with the young Rothar had made him realize that Gendro wasn’t exactly the shining example of how Rothars are supposed to serve their Athers; he often had an attitude, and a bad one at that. Okin walked back towards the main ceremony as the guards went back down the main road with Billy, Damian, and Gendro in tow.

Okin’s father looked down to the cemetery, where the people were still gathered. “I’m a bit late, but I think it’s about time I paid my respects to old Lio.”
