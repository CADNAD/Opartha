Knowing that Aredal, Nexon, Olitheon and most the other gods will not agree to his plan, Tregale begins a rival faction with Intillia, Deionis, Revictus, and Rentar on his side. Their goals are to kill all the legendary beasts and create a united humanist government, with heralds on top.

# 45-38 BP - Tregale underground
Tregale realizes he can make a secret civilization underground. He tries to create his own heralds, but without Time and Light, he does not have the energy required to create living organic beings, who have conception in time and are created when he wants. Little doees he know, he spawns the Spirit Chasms in around 500 years, and his civilization does survive, though very different to his original plan, in modern times. He then moves on to kidnapping civilizations to create his own underground one, which will be a supreme race which will conquer Opartha's surface, defeat the gods, and establish his civilization.

# 38-34 BP - Skirmish wars
Rentar and Revictus find Tregale's current strategy to be not interacting with the real world enough, a bit delusional.

Tregale will not accept these terms, and some skirmish wars are fought, with many gods on Aredal's side dying.

# 34-2 BP - Tyrant Tregale
