A cool breeze blew across Damian’s face. He blinked awake and his eyes stared up at a canopy of green leaves. Sunlight danced between them as the wind rustled the otherwise peaceful atmosphere. He turns his \[ 2021-04-06, 5:49 PM

Turns his what?\]and felt it roll against hard cloth, cloth which covered some something soft. But the cloth was too hard to be his pillow cover. He was in another dream. But this *was* a dream, not a nightmare. Damian exhaled, relaxing his body. He had expected to run, to fight, but this was so peaceful. The tree atop a small hill, surrounded by rolling fields of green, stirred nostalgia within Damian. 

“Linos?” A woman’s voice said. Rolling his \[ 2021-04-06, 5:50 PM

Rolling his what?\]towards the trunk of the tree he found the source. She leaned against the tree and held his head in her lap. The woman---somewhere in her thirties, Damian guessed ---had light brown skin and an angular face. She was pretty, even with the scars.

She smiled down on him and slowly stroked his hair. The touch was both familiar and foreign, but comforting nonetheless .“By Isana’s grace I wish I could sleep half as good in a bed as you do just about anywhere.” 

Damian shifted away from her touch. The woman winced ever so slightly, so slight that Damian was not sure if he had simply imagined it. 

“Wh- wh- who are you?” Damian asked. But the words might as well have been a thought. The woman simply looked down at him and played with the long black braid which hung over her shoulder. 

His chest rumbled and he felt wind pass through his mouth as if he were speaking. But if he had, only the woman could hear the words. 

Her mouth quirked up in a tense smile and she shook her head. “There’s no need for that, I can get on just fine by myself. But I appreciate the offer.” 

Damian felt his chest rumble again. He turned from the woman and pushed himself to kneel next to her. Again, she spoke to him as if answering a question. “Only an hour or two, Berin should tell us when we need to be back. Right?” 

*Berin,* it was an old name, used by generations before even his father’s father. He had read it once before, in a play called  *The Fool and The King*. Damian tensed at the realization. His dreams never included such inane details from the real world. It was only the nightmares that so closely echoed his reality. 

He scrambled to his feat, frantically scanning the horizon for the catch, the thing that would turn the idyllic countryside into a scene which would keep him up for weeks to come. But it did not change. The grass rolled on as far as the eye could see, with only an occasional wolf or gazelle darting across the landscape. 

“Come on, Linos,” Damian’s attention was drawn back to the woman as she called that name again. Was he supposed to be Linos? It wasn’t a name he could recall. In fact, he had never been called a name in any of his dreams of nightmares. There were sometimes titles, but never names. 

“Just sit with me, won’t you?” She opened her arms wide and motioned him into them. He hesitated before kneeling down into the embrace. As he did, he caught sight of it. Of what would haunt the shadows around him for weeks to come. 

Behind the tree, a face peered down at him. Two tall white slits in a deformed face which tapered off in a point behind its own head. All black, the figure appeared to be made from smoky obsidian\[ 2021-04-06, 5:55 PM

Hm, I understand this, but maybe ‘appeared to be made’ isn’t the right descriptor as ‘smoky obsidian’ is obviously not real and is metaphorical. It’s sounds like it’s made of dusty stone although ik in reality it’s dark black smoke \]. It took a step from around the trunk and stared down at Damian. 

He wrenched himself from the woman’s embrace. Scrambling across the grass his gaze remained frozen to the monster. 

“Run!” Damian yelled. It didn’t matter if the woman could hear him, he need to hear it. But try as he may, he was frozen in place. Just like he had been in Metheno. Gods please, somebody, anybody, *help!* 

Damian kicked awake and his covers flapped to the ground. Moonlight shimmered through the small window to his left. Barely enough to make out the walls of the bedroom, but enough to show what crouched at the foot of his bed. Two tall white slits in a face of smoky obsidian. *It was a nightmare, nothing more*. He repeated the phrase like mantra. As if the very idea could dispel what he saw before him. But there had been something more tangible\[ 2021-04-06, 5:58 PM

Are you trying to say that it looks more real now? Because the ‘had’ makes it super confusing\]--- more human than before. 

At the foot of his bed, the monster let out a low drowning croak. In response, Damian fell out of his bed with a scream. His hand blindly grasped for the book he kept on his night stand. Finding it, he lobbed the book at the thing at the foot of his bed. With that he ran. Damian crashed through his bedroom door. The sound of wood slamming on stone filled the room behind him as he barrelled for the outer hall. 

“Help! Help! Help!” Damian yelled the plea into the empty hall. In the dim lantern light he could see the occasional face peaking out of an open door. But non made to stop him.\[ 2021-04-06, 5:58 PM

What?\] As he rounded a corner, a hand shot out in front of him. Carried by his momentum, Damian slammed into the open grip. 

“You fool boy,” a man muttered. Following the arm, he saw Avador standing in the doorway to his own apartment. “What in the name of the Forces are you doing up at night running around and screaming, kid?” 

“There- there was a thing.” Damian said. The stutter was only part fear for the thing in his room, the other was shock at Avador’s dress. It was the first time the man hadn’t been wearing the Order of Tsuman uniform, instead sporting a white tunic and grey wool pants. 

“A thing?” Avador raised an eyebrow. “And what is this *thing* that you’ve got to wake half the Order?” 

“A monster.” 

“It came right out of my dream!” Avador’s eyes narrowed the more Damian spoke. Olitheon be dammed, he’ll never believe me. \[ 2021-04-06, 6:01 PM

Kind of like a swear, and idk if Damian would do the God type of things. probably should be italics\]

“Monsters ain’t re-“ The older man’s gaze suddenly drifted up as a shadow occluded the already dim light of the hall. The demon had *followed* him.

Avador yanked Damian’s shirt, throwing the younger man behind him, into the room. The smoky monster advanced into the room, as if it were chasing Damian, and Avador stood above him, hands held out as to guard the boy.

As Damian ogled at the descending beast on the living room floor, Avador yelled out, “Sani!” 

In an instant, the doorway to Damian’s right was filled by a red haired woman in an grey night gown. She took only a moment to take in the scene before sweeping her arm out towards the black figure. As she did, three plates left on a table in the centre of the room flew past Avador, spinning towards the monster’s torso. But they just flew right through it.

Damian tensed ready for the monster to lash out, but no such reaction came. Instead it remained perfectly steady. “In the name of the forces what is that?” 

“It’s the *monster*,” Damian managed through his frozen face.

Avador slowly backed up towards Damian. “Kid, did it attack you?” 

Damian shook his head. 

“And you say it came out your dream?” Damian nodded and Avador’s face became more thoughtful.

The woman took a step of the door way, her hand still warding towards the figure. “It looks like a summon, Avador.”

“Kid, tell it to come in.” 

“Come in?!” Damian’s jaw dropped. “Why would I do-“  

“Just do it, kid.” 

Damian blinked at his mentor, but he acquiesced. \[ 2021-04-06, 6:04 PM

Maybe a good spot to show how much energy it takes for Damian to conquer his fears and how unusual it is for him. This is actually a spot where a decent amount of introspection is probably good\]“Come in.... please.” 

Slowly the monster moved. Hunching, it walked slowly into the room.\[ 2021-04-06, 6:05 PM

Does it have legs? \]

“Kid, what in the name of the Forces are you?”
