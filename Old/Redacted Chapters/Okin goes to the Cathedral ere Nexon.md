“Follow me!” Okin yelled, turning down the road towards the centre of The Citadel. 

“Where are we going?” Gendro yelled, catching up to Okin. The bright sun had allowed him to absorb enough light to seal the wound completely, and gave him enough strength to push past the pain and keep up with the Ather.

“To the only other ally we have in this city,” Okin said, panting. “Trenton.”

Okin stopped to take a breath, nervously checking his six. After a ten-second breather, the Ather gave Gendro a nod, and the two men continued off towards the Cathedrals and the Seat at the centre of the city.

“How are we going to get to him, though? I don’t think you want to be sending another messenger up to the Seat with Aldwin there,” Gendro said.

“Trenton is an Olitheon Dedicant. He is sure to be in the Cathedral when he is not in meetings at the Seat.”

The massive Light Crystal of Aredal beamed from hundreds of feet above, putting Gendro’s to shame. But Okin wasn’t headed for Aredal’s Cathedral today, rather The Cathedral ere Nexon, which was to the left of Aredal, facing to the North.

“Here,” Okin said, and they turned into one of the many circular roads, sprinting down it until they reached the northern main road, turning right again.

The statue of Nexon towered above the street, holding out its arms like a massive Y. The beautifully cut light stone displayed a man with long, flowing hair and a smooth, handsome face. He was quite lean, and wore a long, streaming robe that stretched behind him like a cape. Unlike the other statues, Nexon was visibly smiling.

Unlike many other Athers, Okin had a deep knowledge of all of the Four, not just his Dedication. As a youth, dreaming of becoming an Ather, he actually thought he would Dedicate himself to Olitheon due to his scholarly nature, but was later enthralled by Aredal’s focus on Truth and Justice in the world. 

But facing the statue now, all he could think about was the short excerpt he had gotten of the supposed Fourth Book of Nexon.

*I stand here today, not because of choice, but lack thereof. He has left me without option. Only he could pressure me to stand against him, only he knows my personality well enough to force my hand. Only my brother.*

Was this smiling marvel really the God who had written that?

Okin shook his head. Once again, these were questions for another time. He was in danger, he needed to focus on the task at hand. 

Like Aredal’s Cathedral, the entrance was guarded by a high-ranking Devinar, who wore shining armour with gilded cuffs and bracers. He held a long halberd at his side, and two steel-armoured Rothars stood at attention to his right and left, all wielding halberds.

The Devinar stepped forward. “Hello, High Ather, welcome to the Cathedral ere Nexon. Why do you wish to enter the Cathedral?”

Okin paused at the question. It was uncustomary for anyone to be allowed into the Four Cathedrals if they weren’t performing something crucial like a promotion in rank or Dedication. The Devinars would most likely bar anyone from entering, even relatively high-ranking clergymen such as Okin. 

Okin lightly pushed Gendro forward, presenting the Rothar. “I am High Ather Okin, and this is my friend Rothar Gendro. He has Dedicated his life to Nexon, and I have come here as his witness to testify that he is worthy of an increase to his Dedication.”

“May I see his Dedication then?” The Devinar asked.

Gendro pulled down his sleeve, revealing the helix shape just below his wrist. The armoured man nodded before stepping aside.

“You are granted entry into the Cathedral,” he said, before turning to Gendro. “I wish you luck in your Dedication.”

The Ather and the Rothar bowed their heads, entering into the stone building. 

Okin placed an arm on Gendro’s shoulder. “Unfortunately, we probably won’t be able to actually to increase your Dedication today. But know that I will always willing to be your witness should you ever need it.”

Gendro nodded. “I understand. And thank you, Okin.”

The Ather smiled, before turning in awe to admire the tremendous Cathedral.

Giant white pillars stretched to the rooftops, lined with decorative artwork of hourglasses and whirlpools. The walls were giant murals, telling the stories of the great feats Nexon had accomplished, and the legendary adventures he set out on.  Ontop the quartz floor laid beautiful light blue carpets, stretching around the dome-shaped cathedral, all pointing towards the giant construct at the centre of the room, directly underneath the arched skylight.

Surrounded by giant bronze gears inside of a large, circular hole, a giant pendulum swung, hung in place underneath the centre of the roof.

The place was empty, except for a lone man kneeling in front of the giant hole, with a light blue cap and pellegrina.

Trenton.

“At least he’s here,” Okin whispered to Gendro as they quietly strolled towards the praying Impalias. 

“Impalias Trenton,” Okin said, and the Impalias looked behind himself to see the two men. 

“Okin! What might you be doing here?” Trenton said.

“I’m afraid it is somewhat an emergency,” Okin said. “I have been investigating a strange group that I believe is trying to manipulate The Citadel, and they attacked me in my room today. If not for Gendro, I would’ve been dead.”

Trenton’s lip quivered as Okin continued. “I feel bad for coming to you again, as you have already done so much for me. But you are the only one I can trust, and I am under your command. If it is your will, I would like to request a secretive place within The Citadel for my Rothar and I to stay.”

Trenton turned back to the pit of gears. “Why? Why would anyone seek to shatter what we have built?”

“Not shatter, I’m afraid,” Okin said. “Control from within.”

Trenton spun back around, his eyes wide and staring directly at Okin’s. “So you are saying that it is members of The Citadel who are plotting against it?”

“I’m afraid so.”

Trenton shook his head, closing his eyes tightly. “Oh Nexon, please tell me that it is my Destiny to help end this. That it is our Destiny as your servants to rid our lands of corruption.”

The Impalias looked back to Okin. “I do not have any places of secret where I could hide you. But, I do have an idea, if you are willing to--- willing to hide in plain sight.”

“At this point,” Okin said. “We’d be happy to try anything.”

“Well then. I will hide you among the Rothar trainees,” Trenton said. 

Gendro shrugged, but Okin shivered. It was easy enough for Gendro, he was already a trained Rothar, and an Absorption Herald. But Okin had both the build and the mind of a scholar, of a preacher. If he had to convincingly stay amongst the Rothars, it would be a sweat.

But he really didn’t have any other option. Was he more afraid of being a weak link, or being killed?

“Thank you, Impalias Trenton. As the timing is crucial---“

“Yes, yes, we’ll go now,” Trenton laughed. “Follow me.”

The three men left the building as the world-sized pendulum continued to tick.
