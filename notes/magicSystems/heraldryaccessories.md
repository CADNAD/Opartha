## dark
Dark Heralds use a parachute/rug-like piece of fabric wrapped up in a small, transportable ball, that when thrown up in the air, unravels into a massive, flat form which casts a large shadow over the area as it gradually falls to the ground, creating a large area over which dark Heraldry can be temporarily used.
