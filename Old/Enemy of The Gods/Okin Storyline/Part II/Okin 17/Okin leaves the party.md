Okin stepped down another step, staying at least one step behind the last man with a beak mask as they made their way down to the dining room of Aldwin’s manor. He squeezed the crystal in his hand tightly, even though the jagged edges pricked his palm. 

All the other masks were making their way inside from Aldwin’s front door, shimmying into a larger huddle that reached wall-to-wall until they got into the dining room. Okin leaned down and glanced to the doorway, which was still filling up with the men who were coming from outside. 

*What if we have to take the masks off?* he thought. *What if someone talks to me, and someone else whose face I can’t see recognizes my voice?*

He needed to get through that doorway and out of here without being noticed.  His eyes flowed down the river of marching masks from the front door to the dining room. 

He breathed a sigh of relief. At least Gendro’s shining armour was nowhere to be seen.

*Where might Previa be?* He wondered. Was he really underneath one of these masks?

Most of the men with the identical beaked-masks had made it through back to the kitchen. 

The doors were held open by two wooden blocks. As he passed them, he wanted to close off the world of masked men inside. But of course, he could not, lest he alert them all of his departure.

Okin sprint-walked, back straight but arms moving swiftly at his sides. He didn’t look back. He just trusted that no one glanced back or cared enough to call him out. 

Without looking, he focused his left hand to his Ather’s satchel and he stuck his fingers in between the flap and the body of the bag, where the rope-like loop on the inside of the flap latched around a large button, keeping the protective flap over the open pouch. He felt around for the rope-like material and when his fingers found it he dug onto it and pulled it open. With a sly movement he lifted the pouch’s cover and threw the crystal he’d been squeezing with his other hand into the bag.

Okin leaned over the hedges as he pried at the gate’s inner locking mechanism. There weren’t many men at the streets, and in a sort of panicked, probably impractical fashion, Okin opened the gate as he shuffled the mask off his face.

Closing the gate and turning onto past the bushes onto the sidewalk where he couldn’t be seen, Okin swung his Ather’s pouch to his front side and made to stuff the raven-like mask back into the bag. He still kept up his heightened posture and hurried steps as he walked along the sidewalk. His eyes flew around the street, darting to every laugh and hoof-stomp on the road to his right and the sidewalk past it.

He breathed a sigh of relief; the outside world seemed oblivious to his plight. He slapped the cover back over the pouch.
