“Billy?  Billy, what are you guys doing?" wide-eyed, Billy did two shoulder checks, and then spun around in a circle, unable to see his caller.  The other two boys, a petite, thin boy with long, jet-black hair, and an equally short, light blonde boy stood still with their hands raised like statues.  Billy heard the snapping of twigs coming from behind him, and then turned around, and could see some movement from behind the layers of thin, dark trees.  

Stretching his neck to get a better view, Billy could now see a white linen shirt which stood out behind the trees, a few dozen feet away.  

“Who is it?" the little boy with blonde hair reached up to tap Billy on his shoulder behind him.  

“It’s Okin," Billy replied.

Ducking underneath the branch of a tree which was blocking his way, the figure in the white shirt made himself clear.  He was taller and older-looking then the other boys, by a few years, and looked as though he was a little less rough-and-tumble.  

“Billy," the teenager said, and his face crumpled seeing the two younger boys hiding behind him.  “What are you guys doing out here alone?”

Standing on his tiptoes, the blonde boy replied, “We’re having a battle.”

The older boy’s mouth hung open in shock.

“No, not a real battle, Okin, we’re just playing around," Billy interjected.

“What do you mean?” Okin asked.  Leaning into Billy’s ear, he whispered,   
“They’re younger, and not like you.  I don’t want them to get hurt, and I don’t want you to be blamed if they do.”

The little blonde boy interrupted again, “We’re doing the Final Battle!  Almighty versus Tregale!”

Okin’s sharp, grey eyes turned to the little boy.  “You shouldn’t be playing as the Gods.  The sacrifice they made for us wasn’t a game," he said.

“This isn’t a game, it’s a reenactment!” the blonde boy replied.  

“It is a game, and you guys shouldn’t be out here all alone in the forest playing it," Okin said.

“Since you’re so bossy and stiff,  you’d be perfect as Intillia," Billy said.  The two younger boys giggled, and Okin glared at Billy.

“Do not *ever* disrespect the Gods. And--- if I was similar to any of them--- it would be Olitheon," Okin replied.

“Perfect, you can be Olitheon, so now it’s fair!” the blonde boy exclaimed.  “I’m Aredal, Billy is Nexon, you can be Olitheon, and Damian is the *Dark Lord Tregale*!”  

Okin sighed. “Ugh, fine.”  A soft smile came across his face.  “I’ll play.”

The two younger boys cheered and Billy smiled.  

“I’ll blast you with a sunbeam!” the blonde boy shouted, holding out his hands in the air towards little Damian.

“Not if I can reflect it!” Okin replied, as he jumped in front of the ‘blast’, holding out his hands as if he were shielding it.

The four boys all laughed as they fought the intense battle.
