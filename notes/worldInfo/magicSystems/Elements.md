# Elements (The Heraldry of Atomic Interaction)

All Elemental Heralds can change their body to a different substance. But they must keep the replacement together. If they loose parts of the transmuted body part, then they can not recover the lost mass

# Solids
Can move and reshape solid objects. Very slow

Does not matter how many "discrete" objects there are, moves on an atomic level, but for the user "by feel".

Can transform non-organs and non-bones into solids.

Can crush and move all solids with the same difficulty, but if they are close to their melting point, it becomes more difficult.

## Worse vs Better Heralds
Worse Heralds move solids slower, they cannot transform solids to other solids that are two chemically or properterly distant from each other, also they expend more crystal (which can also be improved with technique) when transforming solids, but transformation will always be perfect.

## S Tier
- Can easily separate "pure solids" from materials, can separate even small amounts of specific solids from homogenous or heterogenous mix.
- They can manuever thier body, no matter the material, as it was their real body, quicker activation time
- Can make solids more "solid"
- Can manipulate shape of solids at the same speed as Earth benders, can crush solids
- Can engrave words on stone
- Can transform any element into any other element, and any isotope.

## C Tier
- Struggles at separating non-common solids, can separate only obviously visible portions; or heterogenous mixes. Can learn how to separate specific homogenous mixes by first mixing them.
- Feels like they are wearing titanium armor, when they transform their skin and bones into titanium. A little less dexterity. Lots of training to be able to do this well.
- Can make small shapes, can make sure bricks are aligned.
- Can only subtract or add thirty or so protons, and cannot if they do not know the substance.

## F Tier
- Cannot separate solids
- Needs a mould to make good shapes. Even then struggles.
- They are weighed down, and have no control over anything they transform themselves into.
- Can transform any substance into something they commonly know and use, and not if they are by more than 10 protons apart.
