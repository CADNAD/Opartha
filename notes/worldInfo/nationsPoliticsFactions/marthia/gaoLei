The Coral is a legendary flora-like creature which appears like a giant stalk, which can grow upwards to massive sizes. It starts as a stalk, which is cut off and replanted from a larger Coral's stalk, and then if water is left in a line starting from its stalk in any direction, the Coral will grow 'roots' outwards.

The Coral has properties of Dark Heraldry. It can connect people mentally and send thoughts between them if any part of its body, including roots, are connected through shadow to the person/people in question.

- Humans can insert their hands into large holes in the coral's stalk which 'download's their memories into the coral's massive memory database. They can also choose to 'search' for memories that others downloaded to the same coral, and retrieve those memories, quickly picking up new knowledge and experiences.

- As the Coral grows, it can hold more knowledge, it also makes desert farming arable.

## Trades
Special shamans called AeiBai take care of and determine the direction of the Coral's growth. Also, a higher ranking shaman, DaoEiBai, are required to cut off and plant a new Coral.
## Language
GaoLei has several languages from several tribal subcultures, and it is easy to learn languages through the Coral, the most popular amalgamation of tribal dialects is known as NiTan which is likely the language with the most words in all of Opartha. However, the vocabulary is always changing and is different from Coral to Coral.
### Naming Scheme
Newborns are given their last name from the name of the Coral they were born nearest to. Their first name is given and directly put in front of their last name.

Example: First Name 'John', Last Name 'Northcoral'

Result: Johnnorthcoral

However, villagers who are of the native coral often just skip the last name.
## Taboos and Customs
People move between Corals a lot. There is no shame given to a traveler or even settler from another faraway Coral, however, respect is always given most to those who are native to the Coral by travelers and settlers.

Those who have not downloaded to a Coral are looked down upon. It is seen as especially disrespectful to not do a download on important events or milestones such as a birth, marriage, birthday, or feast day.

## Religion and Philosophy
The people believe that the Coral is the only thing that will ensure the retention of knowledge and human civilization for all of time. They believe that people will war inevitably until they are connected through the Coral, which ironically justifies them in annexing other nations by force.
## Class Structure
DaoEiBais are the founders and leaders of tribes, and as a Coral grows, and therefore a tribe grows, a new AeiBai is nominated for every original offshoot root, and if further offshoot roots are too much to handle. In very large cities, the AeiBai will often delegate maintenance of offshoots of his original offshoot root to

"DaoEiBai" means something close to 'master gardener' or 'inner gardener' in the GaoLeian language, and "AeiBai" as 'outer gardener' or 'lesser gardener'.
