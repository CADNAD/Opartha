1\. Simplify and make Okins conflict clearer. Lean towards one of these obvious conflicts:

\-Okin is desperate to be a “good man” but he only looks to society’s standards. This of 		course, means the Citadel in his eyes. He constantly questions whether he is doing right 		or whether he is doing wrong and will justify the wrongest actions if they are justifiable 		by his religion. He becomes conflicted when he can apply two different articles o9f 		doctrine to a problem that are conflicting. His flaw is that he does not know how to act 		in a moral manner when there is no doctrine/authority to guide him.
