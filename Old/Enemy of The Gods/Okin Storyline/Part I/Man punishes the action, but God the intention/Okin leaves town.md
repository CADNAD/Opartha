Gendro was waiting on the main road at the edge of town, leaning against the carriage on top of the hill.  The sun shone down onto the valley below, illuminating the rustic graveyard where Okin had served just the day before.

Okin’s face contorted as he remembered how he had withheld the truth from those guards right here atop this hill. Gendro was right, he had to move forward, inaction wouldn’t redeem his fault, and it certainly wouldn’t increase his Dedication in Bravery or Justice--- which is why he had taken the trial in the first place. The Ather tried to shake the thought from his head as he greeted his Rothar.

Gendro looked up as Okin approached. “What took so long?”

“I said a goodbye to my father,” Okin replied.

Gendro raised an eyebrow. “I almost forgot you grew up here. Must be weird, being so close to--- all this.” Gendro instinctively glanced towards the graveyard below, but quickly turned back to Okin.

“Gendro, I *knew* Billy and Damian. I’m about as close to *all this* as one can be,” the High Ather sighed. “If only I didn’t intervene, if only I didn’t bend one law to preserve another.”

Gendro scoffed. “By Nexon, you’re such a nit, Okin. If you didn’t hold a trial, they probably would have escaped, all the same, but their ‘saviour’ would instead attack the public square during the execution. The point is, you can’t judge your actions based on the outcome. Outcome is influenced by others, and the world around you. You can only judge your actions by intent.”

Okin’s eyes widened. The statement was quite thoughtful, especially for the often grumpy Rothar. “Well, sometimes I feel like my intent, while hidden, is selfish all the same,” he replied.

Gendro placed his foot on the carriage. “Well, selfish or not, you’ve made the decision to drag me a couple thousand kilometres across Wreathward. So stop your incessant philosophical moaning and let’s get going already,” he said, climbing aboard.

Okin smiled, stepping into the carriage. “You’re the one who started with the philosophy, Gendro.”

Gendro smiled back as he hit the reins. “Well, we need *something* to talk about on this trip, and we both know I’m an expert on speaking about matters which I know nothing.” 

Okin ignored Gendro’s jest, looking from the top of the carriage, on the top of the hill, down at the graveyard below. In the brilliant sun was a small group of people, dressed in black, weeping at the grave where he stood just the day before.  

*Oh, Billy. You’re either an evil monster, doomed to rest within the claws of Tregale and Deionis, or we’ve got it all wrong, and you were just a poor boy who watched his father die. I want to believe the latter--- but you’ve made it almost impossible.*
