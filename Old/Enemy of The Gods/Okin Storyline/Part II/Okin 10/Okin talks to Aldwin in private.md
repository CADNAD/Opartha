Okin’s fingers kept tapping against the stone pillars. He glanced at the still Rothars again. It was impressive how they had not asked him to leave or even looked at him; moreover, it was astonishing how they could stand there in those heavy suits for hours on end.

The last couple Athers exited The Citadel. Some had given Okin strange glares, but none physically confronted or questioned him. Still, there was a hint of anger. Okin wasn’t used to being the social outcast, in fact, he was always closer to the prodigy.

Still no Aldwin.

*Those who wait reap the eternal rewards of Time*. *Deliberations of Vaskiel and Aleine, IV.*

And as always, the scriptures proved to be true. Finally, a few minutes after the last few Athers had left the Cathedral, Aldwin strut out with the two Rothars by his side. 

Aldwin immediately noticed Okin and let out a sigh. The Rothars stopped with him, awaiting his command, but his full attention was to Okin.

“Okin. I knew you would still be here,” Aldwin said.

“I’m flattered you think of me so highly, Impalias,” Okin replied. “And I will pursue you throughout the free streets The Citadel and all of Wreathward to uncover this Truth, as is my right.”

Aldwin looked down, but he had on a meek smile. It was possible he respected Okin’s unruly determination, although it was an obstacle for him. “Yes, it is your right. But would such a harassment not be an act of Wrath? And against your very own superior, even an act of Treachery?”

“Not if it is in pursuit of the Values of one’s Dedication. And I apologize that I got a little heated, but we would both be fair to acknowledge that I have been reasonably cordial especially considering what has recently been brought to light,” Okin replied.

Aldwin smiled and shook his head like someone who had just witnessed the most clever move in a board game \[ 2021-08-25, 7:55 PM

Could possibly use in-world example here\]from their longtime friendly competitor.

“Come inside, Okin. We will discuss,” he said. “Rothars, you are free to do as you please. The Ather and I would like some privacy inside the Cathedral.”

“Yes, Impalias Aldwin,” the Rothars said in unison. They marched off down the street after the rest of the Athers.

Aldwin wrapped his hand loosely around Okin’s robe and gently led him back inside the Cathedral. Something about it made Okin shiver now; part of him thought that maybe he wasn’t giving Aldwin enough benefit of the doubt. One accusation, despite strong evidence, and now Okin felt wretched even being touched by his formerly beloved and admired mentor?

Still, though he let it happen, he felt as though he was being led by a pervert as he and Aldwin strolled down the aisle. It didn’t help that out of the corner of his eye he could see Aldwin glancing around and checking his six. Finally, as the approached the front few pews, Aldwin stopped and looked Okin in the eye.

“Tell me, first. How did you find out?”

Okin struggled to keep his emotions in check. He would not blow up yet, though.

“That should be the last thing on your mind now, Aldwin. But I will give you the honesty you have failed to give me. You told me you knew nothing of this accusation, yet you tell your son that there is such a text as the *Fourth* Book of Nexon?”

Aldwin opened his mouth to retort, but Okin just pointed a finger at him and continued ranting.

“And *do not* attempt to continue to deceive me, Aldwin! It is over! I know that this is true,” Okin said.

Aldwin nodded repeatedly, his eyes to the floor.

“And the beggar that set you on this path... do you know who he is? How he found this information?” Aldwin asked.

Okin sighed. “Even though I know it would disadvantage me, I would tell you if I could, Aldwin. But fortunately for the man, *I do not know,”* Okin said.

Aldwin let out a heavy sigh of his own. He shook his head with regret. After a few seconds staring off at what Okin assumed to be the murals decorating the walls of the Cathedral, Aldwin calmly placed both hands on Okin’s shoulders. Despite his rage, the Ather let it happen.

“Okin... I don’t really know where to begin. I know this--- what you think you discovered--- may seem daunting and frustrating, but you must relax and understand what implications your actions have before you pursue them. You have no idea what you’re getting into, Okin. I know, this... I never wanted this. And I do not mean to lie to you. I will take that to my grave, and I will suffer for it. I have damaged my Dedication, but I assure you it is for the best interests of The Citadel, the best interests of Versalism, and the best interests of Opartha itself.”

Aldwin stared into Okin’s eyes and let the words settle for a bit. His hands shook as he studied Okin’s expression, unblinking. 

Okin had to mask the utter shock of Aldwin basically admitting the Truth behind the accusation. He wasn’t sure if it made him more angry or less. He wasn’t sure whether to believe Aldwin regarding his motives, *Tregale,* he wasn’t sure if he could ever truly believe Aldwin again! 

But he was sure that there was no reason, no justification, why an *Impalias of The Citadel,* an *Impalias ere Aredal* should *ever* flat-out *betray* their Dedication to such a horrific degree.

And finally, he was Brave enough to truly express that.

“You’re saying it is true? Well then there is *no* end or motive that can justify what you have done, Aldwin!”

Okin threw Aldwin’s hand’s off his shoulders. Aldwin shuddered back, and Okin encroached on him.

“You’ve--- I assume it is more than one text, and even if it is only one, you have betrayed not only Aredal himself with the most despicable digression, but you have betrayed *all* of the Gods! No matter your motive, you have *betrayed* The Citadel, Versalism, and Opartha!”

“Okin... if you had *any* idea of all that I have done, all that I have *Sacrificed* to keep Opartha secure... if you knew *why*, you would turn around and never speak of this again,” Aldwin said. “And I implore you, please, stop.”

“Then tell me, *tell* me what this great motive is!” Okin’s hands shook at his sides.

“If I did that,” Aldwin sighed. “If I did that would you promise me not that you would do what I just asked?”

Okin narrowed his eyebrows. 

“You and I both know I cannot promise anything, Aldwin. For I would n0t knowingly betray my Dedication like that again. I...I---“

Okin’s face heated up and he inhaled before exploding into a rage.

“*I...* lied... too, Aldwin! *I lied!*” Okin threw his hands at his own chest. “But... I repented. And I will do whatever I can to not fall like that again. But *you*--- you want to keep up this--- this *Deception?* You show *no* will to fix this--- *Treachery.”*

“It’s not about me, Okin! This is about *so much more* than me. For Previa, for yourself! *For your own safety, Aredal!* Please, stop now. Please.” 

Okin stepped back and looked at Aldwin with bewilderment. He had used Aredal’s name in vain, and yet--- that was the most superficial sin he had committed in the past few minutes. How far had Aldwin fell behind the shadows? 

“I cannot, Aldwin. I cannot. I must stand up and be Brave even if I am in danger. I am finally learning that lesson that *you* taught me all those years ago.”

“Okin--- the way it is now--- this way--- it protects the people. It keeps everything *safe*. Upsetting that would have dire consequences,” Aldwin’s breath grew thin.

“If there is word from the Gods that is hidden from the people, then they are not protected. Then they are doomed to commit sin that they do not know,” Okin’s breath grew sharp. “They are doomed! And what are you doing this for? To-to protect that Synodontis, so that *he* may be of equal level to the Gods? You would use Trickery in order to create a false God?”

“No, no, no! The Synodontis has *nothing* to do with this! This--- this is about--- yes, it is about protecting the people! You have no idea, Okin. This is not just about the texts, this is about *so much* more. You have no idea, Okin. So please, just, I know it is hard. But you must *let this go*.”

Okin gave several nods, and Aldwin’s shoulders relaxed a little. 

Then, Okin met his former mentor’s eyes again.

“If I really have no idea--- if I have no idea of the secrets that you keep from me--- from the world,” Okin inched closer to Aldwin, “then how can I trust a word that you say.”

Aldwin’s face grew with horror, and Okin turned to the door. He marched with pride and determination back down the aisle to the street.

“Okin! No! You can’t! Okin! Stop!”

He heard Aldwin’s pleas, his desperate rattling, but he didn’t listen. Aldwin tried to grab him, but Okin just brushed the old man off.

He loved Aldwin, but even he needed to be brought to Justice. Now that he knew the Truth for certain--- he would spread it.
