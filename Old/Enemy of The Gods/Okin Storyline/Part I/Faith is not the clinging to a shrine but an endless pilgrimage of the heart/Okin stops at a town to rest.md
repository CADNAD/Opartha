Okin’s throat throbbed as he swallowed, his tongue rubbing against the sores at the back of his throat. The dirty water was more refreshing than any drink he had ever tasted; the temperature inside the church was finally bearable compared to the chill of riding at night.

Gendro let out a throaty breath. “I’ve never even been here before, but it feels like home. Why couldn’t we have stopped earlier?”

Okin straightened his back, turning to the Rothar. “Who knows how far Billy has gone now? He was either living in Apathasaw or the Apathasawian colonies, that much was clear from his outfit and the strange weapon he held. If he gets back to Apathasaw, the chance we’ll find him again is low to nil.”

“Good thing I took his money,” Gendro smiled.

Okin’s eyes widened. “You didn’t tell me that the whole ride here. You went on ranting about the Devinar Wilston for half an hour--- and you never told me about something that is actually crucial to what we’re doing!”

The young Rothar just chuckled. “Calm down, Okin. I get it, you’re a very wise and established Ather for your age, but you don’t need to be acting like the rest of the old bags yet.”

Okin sighed. “Sometimes I wonder why you became a Rothar. You almost have a *passion* for disrespect.”

Gendro grinned. “Well, Okin, I thought it was common sense that I took all of Billy’s possessions.” 

Okin shook his head. “Ah, you insult a fly for being filthy and it proceeds to bathe itself in dung.”

Gendro laughed. “You insult a thirty year old Ather for acting like a sixty year old Impalias, then he talks like an eighty year old Nihdanian Monk.” 

*Gendro, Gendro. I often remind myself that your humour is part of your Dedication to the Joy of Nexon, but you just never know when to stop.*

“Well, if Billy and Damian were planning to pay an Apathasawian ship for transport, your frisk has made a roadblock in their plans,” Okin said. “I’m curious, do you have the cash on hand?”

“Yep,” Gendro said, reaching into his pocket. He held out a wad of Apathasawian papers. 

“I don’t have too much knowledge of Apathasawian currency, but that seems like a good amount,” Okin said.

Gendro nodded.

The door squeaked open slowly, and a thin woman, around Gendro’s age, wearing a long black garb stepped into the room. She smiled weakly at the two men, and Gendro returned a smile.

“I apologize for the lack of hospitality,” she said. “We usually don’t have visiting Athers or Rothars at this time.”

“There is no lack of hospitality,” Gendro said, smiling. “We’re just happy you let us in.”

“Well of course, any house of Moden Versalism welcomes Athers and Rothars no matter where they’re from,” she replied. “I believe we have some spare rooms upstairs. Would you like me to lead you to them?”

“That would be wonderful,” Okin replied.

The spare rooms were extremely minimalistic: a bed, a nightstand, and a prayer bench, all atop a fuzzy cream carpet. Okin smiled at the Istar; while he knew that a church would never turn away a High Ather, it was still a luxury which he was extremely grateful for. 

Okin closed the door to the hall, and knelt down onto the prayer bench. Closing his eyes, he held out his placed his hands together as he spoke.

“I wish nothing more than to pursue Justice in your name. I will fight off the Deception of Deionis and the Pride of Tregale until I breathe my last, but I am more lost than I have ever been. I do not understand if it is your hand acting in ways I cannot comprehend, or if this is my duty to fight the forces of evil. Please, give me the strength to enact Justice as you see fit. Please, give me the guidance to perform your will. Aventa.”

Okin finished his prayer and said some last warm thoughts for his father, the ate Lionos Gruissem, and the people of Metheno and the world. He got up from his bench, snuffed out the candle and laid down on the bed to rest.

“Thank you for the wonderful hospitality,” Okin said, and the Istar smiled back.  Gendro and him left the Ather’s quarters and entered the main hall of the church, which like their rooms was small, homely, and dim. 

A couple was already lined up near the back of the room, praying to the row of candles, the only source of light.  As Okin and Gendro came within visible range, a short, dark-haired man looked up from his praying stance.  

“Ather!  Ather!,” he said, clutching his wife and turning her to face the two men.  His excited expression changed to one of confusion as he came face-to-face with Okin.  “I have not seen you here before, Ather.”

“Rothar Gendro and I were just staying here for the night.  We are on the road to The Citadel,” Okin replied.

“The Citadel?” The man said, eyes widening.  “Well then surely you have important business to attend to, I mustn’t bother you.”

“If you have something to ask, my ears are always open, son,” Okin said.

“Oh, thank you, Ather,” the man smiled.  “My wife and I come to church every week, and we read our children the writings of The Pact every day before bed.  But there was a question my young son asked me that I could not answer, so I turn to you for guidance.”

“What is the question, son?”

“My son asked me ‘why didn’t Aredal didn’t stop Tregale before The Betrayal?’ I was going to tell him that it was because Aredal and Tregale used to be friends, but I know the Citadel teaches that Aredal can see the true nature of all, that none can hide from his Justice, from true Justice.  Now, if Aredal could see that Tregale would betray the Gods, why didn’t he stop him?”

Okin scratched his chin. “You know that the Four and Tregale are the true embodiments of the Five Forces which control our world, that they are the physical form--- the *human* form of astral powers beyond our comprehension.  But when the Five Forces brought themselves into this world, they *chose* to limit their powers in order to be more like us, so that we could understand them.  Tregale--- the Force of Darkness--- he broke that *Pact*, he betrayed the Gods, he betrayed *humanity*.”

The man nodded off, his eyes darting around the room as he clutched his wife.  “Thank you Ather.  I-I just have one inquiry, if that is alright.”

“Go ahead, my son,” Okin said.

“Tregale--- was his soul always corrupt?  Did Aredal really fail to see the darkness which corrupted his soul?  Or did he change, was he changed by his experience here, with *us*?”

“Now that is a question which I cannot answer,” Okin said.  “Perhaps there was always some Darkness in Tregale’s soul, that overtook him during his time on this planet.”

“Thank you, Ather,” the man said, before turning back to the candles with his wife.  Okin nodded, and he and Gendro exited the church.

The two men were greeted by the carriage which they had left overnight.  

Okin took a deep sigh as he got into the passenger seat.

“What would that man think, if he knew that I, one who is supposed to lead by example, had just betrayed my Dedication days before?”

Gendro rolled his eyes. “What would that man think if he knew that you kept whining to me like a little girl?”

“This isn’t a joking matter, Gendro! I-I was true in my Dedication to the Truth above all else! Yes, I haven’t had enough experiences in my Dedication to Justice and Bravery as I should have, but that was my one strength that proved that I serve Aredal! And now it’s gone!”

Okin’s chest heaved up and down after finishing his rant. Gendro’s face was stoic, and he made a calm response.

“Perhaps this predicament is a blessing in disguise. You have focused too much on one, and have no sense of balance,” Gendro said. 

Okin’s eyes widened. He had spread similar beliefs to Previa just a day before, and had asked Aredal for an opportunity to practice what he preached.

“I-I am sorry, Gendro, I shouldn’t have yelled. You are right, you know. You would have made a good Ather.”

Gendro chuckled, slapping the reins. “Ah, Okin. We both know I can barely even be a poor Rothar.”
