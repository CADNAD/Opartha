Boats, it was always a boat. He had spent nearly a month on a boat to get to Wreathward, now he was going to spend who knows how long cinking long on another boat. At least this one didn’t make him seasick, but the frigid air and feeling of lightheadedness was probably a bad tradeoff. Plus, he wasn’t a pussy, but being up *so* high, all relying on this weird blob to lift up a ship that appeared to be triple it size---it was a *little* nerve-racking. The room the same size as the one that Damian and himself had shared on their way to Metheno, but they had to split it amongst the three of them now. Benjamin had gone above deck, not spending much of his time here. The crew had taken him in easily. O*nce a sailor, always a sailo*r, Billy thought. 

He had slept most of the day since their departure, and slept through Damian leaving. Damian had been there when Billy had fell asleep, but where had the youth gone? Probably crying over having to leave Metheno.\[ 2021-04-06, 6:33 PM

Idk, Billy is the more nostalgic one.\] 

Being honest with himself, Billy was pretty devastated about the situation, too. The thoughts of his dad that were all joyful and excited on the boat ride to Metheno now made him want to smack his head. At least this high up it was hard to think.

Peering out the porthole, Billy wondered what time it was. He guessed it was some time past noon based on how damned bright the sun was, although it seems the days were much longer flying above the clouds. So he had slept for how long, twelve hours? He wouldn’t be sure till he found someone else to ask. *Speaking of asking, I’ve got some big questions for a certain someone*. Allia Su-Han, Kandonsong of The Order of Tsuman, whatever the hell that meant. A fucking cult, by the way Damian described them. A cult which apparently infected even what should have been the most upstanding, loyal of men. It wouldn’t be the first time he had seen manipulators so---unbelievable.

He swung his legs over the side of the bed, and found him self stumbling to the wall. “I guess I never got those sea legs,” he said to himself. His father had always tried telling him that as soon as he got older all this would be fixed. He’d figure out sailing and would join him, galavanting the globe, collecting antiquities and exotic items from every corner of the known world. He might not be collecting items, but he was going to eery corner of the known world. He stood up, dusting off his jacket and straightening out his collar. He grabbed one of the stringy coats that had been given to him by the crew, and put it on, shaking his body, preparing himself for the beyond frigid air outside. 

Stepping out of the cabin, he found himself on the lower deck of the ship, and slammed the door shut. His cabin was at the stern of the ship and in front of him stretched thirty guns, fifteen on each side. He chuckled to himself, imaging another ship flying up here to fight them. 

The cloud beds were painted in a lively palette of violets and oranges. Looking out towards his brightness, he squinted directly at the big ball of light as if to challenge it. How did a star of yellow and white create such a vast array of colours?

While some of the crew was all bundled up, they still worked with discipline. The discipline of true soldiers, not payed thugs. An orchestral rhythm of work. He had gone on several ships before, guarding supplies, on the run between cities, and as a guest with his father. But never an---airship? Perhaps the threat of falling out of the sky made men more conscientious. 

“Hey you over there!” Billy shouted to one of the sailors who leaned over a cannon, polishing it, one of those slimy tentacles from the beast wrapped around his foot. The man turned, exposing an angular face with short brown hair. His eyes were narrowed, annoyed at the disturbance. 

“Yeah?” he asked, his voice gruff. 

“You mind telling me where that crazy ass girl is?” 

The man pointed towards a staircase in the centre of the ship. “She’s in the captain’s cabin. No idea what she had to do to get in there.” 

Billy gave the man a respectful nod before taking the staircase to the main deck. 

It took his eyes a moment to adjust to the sun as peeked his head out. Looking at the sun through the two masts, he could see that it was perhaps an hour or two off noon. \[ 2021-04-06, 6:42 PM

Might take this out as I have sun scene before this\]Across the deck Benjamin was lounging against the railing, striking up conversation with a female sailor. Female sailors were rare enough, but a female sailor on a warship? Well, if one existed, then of course Benjamin had found her. Billy spared a simple chuckle before turning to the stern of the ship. Ther,  a red door was inlaid under the quarter deck. That had to be the captain’s cabin.
