“What was that?” Damian whisper-shouted after Billy and him had made it a good distance away from Mr. Cantas’ house and the rest of the town.

“I had to make it believable,” Billy hissed. “You think some men would come *all the way* from Apathasaw and just be happy with leaving empty handed?”

“I *kind of* understood talking him up, but asking for whiskey? Sleeping at his house? You said it yourself, Billy, we aren’t here to meet new friends! And it’s *way* riskier to be talking to old ones!”

“He’s not *our* friend, but--- yeah. I just--- I know you’re tired, and it’s too late now to keep going, and--- I don’t really have a place for us to stay,” Billy bit his lip.

Billy stabbed at himself from within. What kind of *failure* planned out a whole trip like this without a reliable place to stay the night? 

Then again, back in Apathasaw, there was almost always a place that would trade a night of shelter for some chores or extra security. And here in Wreathward, he had to be extra careful.

So yes, Damian was right. Taking that offer would have been reckless. Billy always got more reckless when alcohol was around, even if he wasn’t drunk yet.

“Well--- this is a port city now. There’s gotta be a room for rent,” Damian said.

“I’m not giving a cent to these bastards,” Billy said. “And plus, they don’t take Apathasawian currency here, and I’m not getting scammed in an exchange.”

“So--- what are we going to do?” There was that common pleading in Damian’s voice. When he heard questions like that from the boy, Billy realized how little Damian had changed since--- well, since they had *left* this place*.*

Of course, Billy needed to look out for Damian. The boy didn’t really have an eye for *opportunity*--- and it seemed that Damian always thought and debated with himself a little too much, when sometimes things just needed to be *done.* 

Billy looked out at the large farm properties on this large street, the same street where Lionos’s mansion was, up ahead now. 

“Look,” Billy pointed out at the now shadowed barnyards. “These properties are *huge*, and everyone sleeps early here. No one would know if we stayed the night in a shed, as long as we woke up before sunrise.”

“Why not? It’s not the worst place we’ve ever stayed.”

Billy narrowed his eyes and grabbed Damian by the shirt. “Damian--- listen. Sometimes we just gotta take things from others. And it’s not like *they* didn’t just take it from someone else more innocent before. *I know*, that *you* *know,* that sometimes we only *ate* because I took from others in Apathasaw.”

“I know,” Damian looked up with a slightly defensive glare. “That’s why I didn’t eat sometimes.”

“Well, now you’re becoming a man, Damian. And you have to know that that’s just the way it is sometimes. *We* were given a bad hand, and others got lucky and struck gold. If they leave their gold out, it’s our *right* to take it.”

“And plus, we aren’t even going to be taking anything this time,” Billy waved his hand forward. “So come on.”

Damian sighed, but he did follow Billy. Billy sped his pace. The sun was setting on the horizon on the wide, straight road; it looked as if they kept on fast enough, eventually they would meet the sun. But of course it kept setting, and of course it would eventually get dark\[ 2021-11-04, 2:56 PM

Maybe not capitalize\].

But Billy had it in his mind that he would at least pass that white manor again. That at least he would see his childhood home one more time.

And he did. But for some reason, after a quick glance at the feint, orange sunlight over the white pillars, he couldn’t bare to look at it.

Luckily, there was a desolate group of farm sheds and stables just past a field of growing corn.

“C’mon, Damian,” Billy used hn arms to assist himself over the fence. His arm almost slipped, and he almost dropped the glass of whiskey, which still about half-full. “We can rest over there for the night.”

With a grimace, Damian followed Billy over the fence. The boy was overly nervous--- the rural property was so large, the only residence was barely visible from here, and to was near impossible to see two tiny figures at this time. Plus, even if the landowner did see them, they would likely assume Billy and Damian were just wild animals--- and no Wreathwardian would come out at dusk just for that. 

So Billy scurried through the fields of corn, occasionally checking his six to make sure Damian wasn’t too far behind. Soon enough, they reached the sheds.

Billy sneaked over to the first shed. There was a rusty iron handle on the door, and he tugged on it. Not surprisingly, it was locked. 

Billy wanted to scream and curse, but he bit his lip as he heard Damian’s footsteps sneak up behind him.

He moved to try the other sheds, they were all locked as well. Billy sighed.

He turned his head as he heard a neigh. He followed the sound and ended up at the stables. The wooden gate was locked, but he could get over it. He motioned with his neck to Damian, and the two climbed over.

Most of the stalls were full of resting Trentanian mares or food and dung. But just at the end, there was one that was left unoccupied, exempt from a small pile of hay.  Sneaking tacitly, the two men approached the covered stable.

“Here,” Billy said. “We’ll stay here the night.”

“But...there’s only one stall, and well--," Damian awkwardly pointed to himself, and then Billy. 

“You take it.”

Damian pushed open the stall gate and looked over it. “It looks like there’s enough room for the both of us.  It might rain, you wouldn’t wanna---”

“I’d rather get wet then cuddle up with you like some kind of cinking faggot," Billy chuckled.  “Get some rest.”

Nodding sheepishly, Damian climbed over the hay bales. He awkwardly laid down on top of them, shovelling off pieces of hay that stuck out.  Turning onto his side, he tucked his hands together under his head like a pillow.

Billy pretended to walk away; no one could fall asleep with someone ogling over them, even a brother.

But after a few minutes, Billy checked o the boy again. He appeared to be asleep.  Unmoving, silently breathing, like a resting infant. 

Billy enjoyed this time alone, at night, not being bugged by Damian’s whining, or the judgemental, arrogant looks from the ever-conceited natives. And he hadn’t had a taste of *real, hard* liquor for over two weeks, so gods be damned, he would finish this entire bottle.

He stumbled over to a sleeping Damian. The young lad shivered a bit, but he still appeared to be asleep.  Even through the strong smell of liquor on his lips, Billy could smell the stench of Damian’s clothes,  which had seen a massive buildup of perspiration.  Or maybe that was his own?  Or even just the smell of the large, grimy horses which were probably lying in their own shit?  Whatever the case, Billy knew it could be masked by some more drinking, and so he took another swig of the now half-empty bottle of whiskey.  He jugged the rest down in one chug.

Dropping the now empty bottle on the ground,  Billy doddered closer to a sleeping Damian, extremely slowly; he was trying his best not to wake him.  Taking off his jacket, Billy attempted to place it on the shivering boy, but in doing so he fell forward. His face landing towards Damian’s backside--- Billy could feel his nose touch Damian’s ass.

“Get some rest," Billy murmured, before realizing what he was staring at. “What am I doing?”  he trailed, trying to stand up but just pushing himself onto the muddy ground. A waterfall of puke came streaming out of his mouth, or maybe it was more like a volcanic eruption, except upside down.  

Rolling onto his back, Billy could see the twinkling stars up above.  They flashed themselves, smiling at him, were they greeting him? No, they were mocking him, high on their horse just because they were the little piece of light that could shine through the all-encompassing darkness.  

And one star even flew through the air, he was dancing over Billy, like a gazelle galloping by a crippled, dying tortoise.   

*Fuck the stars. I wish I never saw you and your fucking dumbass lights ever again.*

And in a few moments,  Billy’s wish was granted.
