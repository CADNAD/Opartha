The northern outskirts of the town were less modern and refined than the area surrounding the ports.  Small buildings made of cobblestone, uneven wood, and few windows was the extent of the architecture, but it was a sight of pleasure nonetheless, the feeling of childhood familiarity. 

Billy stopped in front of a house with a tall cobblestone base, a wooden roof and a large window that stood above his head. There was ample moss building up on the underside of the roof, and the window frame was warped and rotting. 

*I wonder if he’s still here.*

Instinctively, Billy marched to the wooden entrance of the house and gave it a knock. He heard footsteps from inside, and the door swung open. A short, plump man with a small nest of thin white hair and a wrinkled face stood below Billy. Looking up with scrunched eyebrows, examining the rugged cowboy’s face, the elderly man itched his chin.

“Need something?” He asked.

Billy’s eyes lit up. “Mr. Cantas?” 

The old man backed away from Billy. “How do you know my name?” 

Billy stammered. “I-I’m a traveller from Apathasaw, and I ran out of Wreathwardian steltells, and the townspeople say that you were the most hospitable man in Metheno," the cowboy smiled weakly. 

The old man snorted. “Eh, well I guess I got nothing better to do. Come on in," he held open the door and waved the two men inside. Inside, it was much more humid, and smelled of charcoal. It was also rather empty; a wooden shelf containing raw vegetables and grains, a cast-iron stove, two chairs and a table occupied one side, and pots, pans, tools and buckets were scattered across the stone brick floor. The other side of the room had an iron-framed bed with no sheets or pillows, and a staircase leading upwards to a second floor. On top of the food shelf were two unopened bottles, probably whiskey.

“Take a seat. I’ll make you both some tea," the old man said, and Billy and Damian sat across from each other at the table. Opening a cabinet below, the man grabbed a stone teapot and began filling it with water from a large wooden bucket.

“Uhm, actually," Billy spoke up, grabbing the attention of the host. “Could I perhaps get some whiskey, or gin, or any sort of spirit?”

The stout man furrowed an eyebrow. “Quite unusual for an uninvited guest to ask for liquor," he said. Damian shook his head, glaring at Billy.

“Yes, I know, I apologize," Billy said, his eyes locked with Damian’s, his hands on his knees below the table. “It’s just I have some dark memories when it comes to Metheno, and that’s the only thing that can numb my mind enough.”

“Mhm," the man scratched his chin, eyeing Billy. “Well, Intillia teaches that one should always attempt to ease a man’s pain when the means to do so are readily available.” Standing on his tiptoes, the man reached up to grab one of the bottles from the shelf. Indeed, it was whiskey. 

*Maybe I can finally thank those damn Gods for something*, Billy thought.

“Would you like anything, my friend?” The old man asked Damian as he opened the bottle with a corkscrew. 

Damian shook his head. “No thank you, sir.” The old man walked to the table with a glass in one hand and the bottle in the other. Placing down the glass, he poured out the whiskey into it, but his hand began to shake, spilling some on the table.

“I’m sorry," the old man said, wiping the table with his sleeve, watching Billy’s face carefully. “It’s my age, you know.”

The man continued to pour, this time with both hands, until the cup was around three-quarters full.

“Thank you, sir," Billy said, smiling to the man. He slid his right hand out from under the table and grabbed the cup of whiskey, chugging it all down in one gulp and slamming the glass back down on the table with a satisfied sigh. 

“I’m sorry, I never got your name," the old man said.

“You can call me, uh, Saul. And this here is--- Meryl,” Billy replied, gesturing to Damian.

“Hm. And why might you be in town, Saul?” the old man asked.

“Eh, just business," Billy replied.

Billy nodded, and he hid his hands back under the table. “Could I get another drink?” he asked.

“Of course,” the old man said, grabbing the bottle from the counter and pouring him another glass. His eyes drew away from Billy’s as he carefully poured with both hands to counteract their shaking. 

Damian eyed Billy from across the table, his pupils motioning for the door.

“How’s--- you have any kids?” Billy asked the old man while he finished pouring.

The old man nodded. “Yeah, just one. A boy, about your age. Maybe a bit older.”

Billy looked around the room. “Where’s the wife?”

The old man craned his neck downwards. “She passed a few years ago. Only a single man could make a household look like this," he chuckled.

Billy bit his lip, then released it and laughed, “You should see what two men can do.” He downed the second glass.

“Ah," Billy eyed the bottle in the man’s hand. “Could I, maybe---“

“Just have the rest," the man said, slamming the bottle down onto the table. Damian got up from his seat, going around the table and urging Billy up.

“We should really be going now, wouldn’t want to overstay our welcome," he said, smiling to the old man.

“It’s no trouble. I got an extra bed upstairs and a spare bedroll if you’d like to stay the night," the man replied.

Billy smiled. “That sounds---“

“Thank you, but we need to be on our way," Damian spoke up, pushing Billy away from the table.

Billy reached forward to grab the bottle from the table, his golden watch showed itself from underneath his sleeve as he stretched out his arm, just barely grabbing it. The old man squinted at Billy’s shimmering wrist as Damian guided him out of the house, slamming the door shut on the frozen old man.
