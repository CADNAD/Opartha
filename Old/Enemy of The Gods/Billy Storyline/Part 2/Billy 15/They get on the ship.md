“Run, run!” 

The pain numbed over his body, and he sank into Benjamin’s shoulder, only occasionally drifting from blackness to blurry flashes of red dust .

“Duck! They’re coming back for us!” Allia screamed. There was an alarming heat on Billy’s right side, and a magenta blob flashed in the blackness of his closed eyelids, empowering with Benjamin’s heaved breaths and pounding heartbeat. Billy let out a throaty ache.

“There! Get in! Quickly!” It was Allia’s voice again. Benjamin grunted, and Billy jolted up on his shoulder; there were more clanky footsteps. 

“I must set you down! Stay still Billy!” Benjamin shouted, and Billy felt his back lay against a more solid surface. He forced his eyes open, his friend’s imposing face was covered in sweat.

“Whhhee---Whe-re’s Damian?” Billy croaked, but by the time he got his eyes open again Benjamin had already stomped off.

Billy’s hands slithered around, wrenching upward at the sharp stab of splintered wood. He let out a breathy tremble of both pain and agony: once again, a massive, gelatinous form hovered above him, extending wiry tentacles in all directions. And dozens of those tentacles were gathered at the bow of the ship, wrapping around his brother.

Billy writhed himself toward Damian and the others, who were even farther up the bow, facing the spikes of the beast. 

A brutal shockwave coming from below shook the entire boat. Billy clawed himself up onto a box, unnoticed by the others. 

A mere hundred metres away and closing in, four men in navy robes were sprinting towards them. The closest of them had stopped, and was ripping away pieces of the ground---the beast’s back--- and hurling them in plumes at the ship. He took out a chunk of red ‘rock’, part of which crumbled off back into the beast, and pitched it right at the escapees. Benjamin held out both hands, redirecting the projectile back into the ground below.

“C’mon, c’mon. Okay, okay,” Damian muttered frantically under his breath again. 

“Take down that ship! Don’t let it leave!” The pursuers lurched closer and readied their multitude of weapons.

“Please,” Damian whispered, clasping his hands together. “I-I---I need you.”

“Yes,” A demonic growl ensued from all around. 

Spiralling out from Damian’s own fingers, five streams of ghostly black mist coalesced into demonic manifestation, eyes surging with equally smoky, yet flaring crimson eyes. It shot out over the deck of the ship, its legless form whirling off with the wind, yet remaining whole; the back of its head flowing behind like a horses’ mane.

Their pursuers shrilled at the monstrous sight, the commander dropping his spear and hiding his face under his forearm. The two Elementals shot stone and fire at the demonic being, both slipping through its form as if it were really only mist.

The demon stretched out long, thin arms, circling in its lengthy claw-like fingers at the end. The Elementals stopped their barrage, and the being let out hissing exhale---before lurching forward with claws outstretched.

Benjamin and Allia stepped back from the edge of the ship, turning around and looking at Damian with wide eyes.  The lad gave a childish smile. Though he couldn’t manage the effort, inside, Billy smiled as well. Though he had mostly stayed out of the combat, and had still hid in fear---Damian had come to rescue him, and he’d taken a big risk by doing so.

“Now you,” Damian looked up to the bulbous blob. “We need to fly.”

The Ytternu stayed docile, only its tendrils swaying back and forth as per usual.

Damian closed his eyes, reaching two fingers up to his head.

“Fly.”

The creature rumbled, its tendrils straightening. The boat was yanked in the air, and Billy’s vision flickered from blackness to bright fog.

They skyrocketed over the beast, and once again had vision of the only the tips of the spikes peeking above the clouds, the rest of the beast covered in a foggy carpet. Billy didn’t know why he stared over the deck, he was nauseated enough as it was.

A ball of black mist shot out the identically textured clouds. It landed on the deck in an almost graceful fashion.

Billy almost tumbled off of his box, but Benjamin reached out his hands, stabilizing the outlaw without even touching him.

The demonic Summon turned to Damian, whose hands trembled, strangely matching a wavering smile.

“T-th-thank you,” Damian said.

The ghostly form almost bowed, the triangular back of its head tilting to the moon above. 

“Yes, master,” it growled. Its’ throaty exhale echoed as Billy faded away.
