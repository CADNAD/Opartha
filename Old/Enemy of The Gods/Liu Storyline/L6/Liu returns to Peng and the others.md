Liu and the summoner rejoined the rest of the group, who were standing in a circle near the centre of the field. He saw Iri’s the shine and flare of Iri’s red and gold tunic; the commander was speaking to the group of boys.

Upon seeing Liu approach, the commander turned, addressing Liu solely. “That was a very intense match! You played very well Liu, except it seemed you weren’t playing at all during those last several minutes, what happened?”

Liu entered the crowd of boys who were surrounding Iri. “I wanted to get information from my Parrot before I made a decision, but I didn’t know that my parrot was eliminated,” Liu said.

“Ah,” Iri responded. “I thought that much. Sometimes as a commander you don’t ever find out when a spy is eliminated or when one of your most trusted squads have been wiped out on the battlefield. As you probably saw, waiting and inaction are a surefire way to lose a war.” 

Iri eyed both Jin and Liu with a sly smile. "In fact, both of you advanced to a second tent, leaving the entrance to said tent unguarded. It was only a matter of who attacked first, and that was Jin. And while you did end up victorious Jin, you didn’t attack the easier, unguarded target.”

Jin stayed silent, looking down awkwardly.

“Still, you took a gamble, and you ended up right. The right gamble can always win a war, but you never really know what the right gamble is.” 

Ah, so Jin never knew that I went to the second tent. Still, my chalk wasn’t exactly well-guarded.

“Well, that was decent while it lasted. It’s meal time now, and then the rest of the day,” Iri said. Iri led the way towards the lunch hall, the troop of boys following behind.

A figure shuffled through the crowd towards Liu as they walked. It was Peng, ever so smily.

“You played very well, Liu. Now that you know the basics, you should roll through the next game.”

Liu’s eyes battered. “I didn’t play very well, I made an idiotic blunder.”

Peng’s smile only grew. “It wasn’t that idiotic. Plus, now you’ll never make that blunder again, and next time you’ll crush it.” Peng patted Liu on the back, and Liu flinched.

Peng’s smile faded.  “Oh, I’m sorry Liu, did I scare you?” 

“No,” Liu replied, as the group headed into the lunch hall. 

“Well, day one and you’re already losing big time,” Khan chuckled, looking to Liu’s still present bruise. “And from the looks of it, it isn’t the only fight you’ve lost recently.” Khan smirked.

“Hey, he played well,” Peng said. 

Khan scoffed. “Maybe by your standards, Pengy-Peng. He played like absolute shit. Even another beginner absolutely massacred him.”

From the end of the table, Jin raised a finger. “Actually, I was introduced to Hyo-Ra a few years ago. My uncle took me to a game in Manailang and taught me about all the units.”

“I wasn’t talking to you, Jin,” Khan responded, turning back to Peng. “Anyway, I know I can crush you. Either of you. I already beat you before, Peng, and Liu just isn’t good.”

Peng smiled at the other boy. “I don’t know, Khan, I think you’re getting rusty. I bet in a month or two, Liu will whoop your ass.”

Liu looked away from both Peng and Khan and down to his food, as Khan laughed.

“Ah, Peng, I didn’t think you were that stupid, and that gay for your new roomie.”

From the end of the table, Iri interrupted. “You know what, Khan, I also think he’ll be able to beat you in a few months.”

Khan turned in surprise to his commander. “W-What? W-Why?”

Iri took another bite of his food, returning to his usual disinterested attitude. “Well for one, you’re not as good as you think you are. But more importantly, you won’t ever shut up at the table, no matter how many times I tell you to.”

A self-satisfactory smile came across Iri’s face, and the rest of the boys laughed, except for Khan, and Liu.
