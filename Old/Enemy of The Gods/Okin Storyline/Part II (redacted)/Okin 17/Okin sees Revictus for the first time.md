“So you need help sneaking? I wouldn’t say that is necessarily my forte,” the hobo said.

“You seemed quite adept when we were at the church,” Okin said, stopping to recount his steps at an intersection.

“I’m not so sure. But, I guess in this manner, a man of the streets can always teach a man of the book something.”

Okin turned right down the path, and the beggar followed close behind. 

“Are you sure this is the right way?” The beggar asked, a hint of mischief in his voice.

“Yes,” Okin responded.

The streets were clear at this time, but Okin would do a headspin after every twist and turn. A couple times a loud gust of wind almost blew him off his feet, his heart stopping at every passing sound. All of Okin’s senses were heightened, and he could even make out the rough shape of the beggar in the pitch-black darkness.

“That’s it,” Okin said, pointing at the top of the tall church building, its features hidden by the utter darkness. “That’s Arten’s church. He should be up there,” Okin motioned to the western side of the church, where there was a window that emitted warm, dull light near the top of the building.

“He should be in there,” Okin said. The shining window was hopeful. Many people slept with candles nearby, to ward off the Darkness.

“Okay, so we’re just going to watch an Ather sleep? I’m not going to stay around for sunrise,” the beggar said. 

“Uh...,” Okin didn’t exactly have a plan. “Well, I’d like to at least get a view into the window.”

“Well, why not?” The bearded vagabond grinned.  “Who is this man, anyway?”

“He---he is threatening the fairness of the election,” Okin replied. “Against our favour.”

“Well, perhaps you can find a way to threaten him back,” the beggar said. “And I think I can find us a way up that building.”

The beggar motioned for Okin to follow; it was a miracle the Ather could even see in this darkness, but lately he had gotten more used to it. He followed the vagrant around to a building on the opposite side of the alley from the church.

Crouching behind a windowsill, the beggar leaped in the air, latching to the side of the building like a spider.

Okin climbed up more hesitantly, his fingers settled into the cracks and crevices, his feet perfectly placing onto the window ledges and up to the deck railing, scaling him up the building after the beggar. 

He struggled to pull himself up to the roof, and his ankles shook as he reached his hand to cling onto the ledge. 

“C’mon.”

The beggar reached his hand down, and Okin clasped onto it, allowing himself to be pulled up onto the roof.

From the top of the building, standing on his tiptoes, Okin could see right into the church window where the candle glowed. There was no sign of Arten, or anyone for that manner.

“I am gaining support. But many still stand by him, I hear them talking.”

The whispering was coming from the alley directly below them. 

Okin crouched down into a frog’s squat. He slowly peeked over the rooftop. Next to the side of the church, he could just make out two figures under the shimmering moonlight. But their features were still muffled. He squinted at the darkness.

“Continue to play your part,” a much deeper voice said. “I will take care of the rest.”

“Trenton is a wise man, I’m sure we can make him see our vision,” the first voice said.

The breathy tone, the slower voice; there was no doubt, the speaker was Arten. And the shape of the robes confirmed it. Before, Okin would be shocked that a clergymen would be out at this time, but now it seemed everyone had something to hide and all were sneaking around past midnight.

But the other shape was much more horrifying. The long, curved beak--- identical to the profile of the assassins who tried to kill Okin in the visiting complex.

“I said--- play your part. Do not speak to Trenton.”

“I-I understand,” Arten replied. “There is something else I must tell you. I---“

There was silence for a moment.

“What is it? Spit it out,” the other voice said.

“Look! Up there! Something’s up there! Watching us!” Arten shouted.

The beak turned away from Arten and pointed toward the sky, at Okin. Then it vanished--- blinked away as if it was never there.

Okin shrunk back, pulling away his eyes from the scene. He turned to his right--- the beggar had been there before, but was nowhere to be found. 

Okin peeked back over the terrace, his heart racing.

Arten stood there, looking around as frantically as Okin had been seconds before.

This was his only chance. 

The Ather scooted up to the edge of the roof. It was over a dozen foot drop, onto concrete.

He closed his eyes.

*Be Brave.*

He carefully lowered his body, placing his hands on the roof’s edge, and slid off.

His finger’s gripped the side of the wall. He glanced down for an ever-fearful second, and dropped.

His knees and thighs ached from the impact, but they didn’t break. The booming landing elicited a childish squeal from Arten.

*You have to look strong, not afraid.  No more chasing other’s crumbs.* 

Okin didn’t even take time to stand up from his lunge. He dashed forward elbow first, pinning a terrified Arten against the church wall behind him.

“W-what do you want?” The older Ather pleaded, covering his face.

“For you to drop out of this election. I know you’re just a puppet,” Okin deepened his voice, growling. “That you’re just running to unfairly take away votes from Trenton!”

Arten removed his hands, his eyes widening. “How could you know that?”

“It’s obvious. What I don’t know is *why,”* Okin pushed forward on Arten’s chest, squeezing him against the wall. “Is there some sort of arrangement? A bribe?”

“Please, please! I don’t want power, or money! I’ll drop out, I’ll resign!”  Arten wailed. “I’m just doing as I’m told!”

Okin grunted, shoving a hand to Arten’s neck, glaring into the Ather’s now babyish eyes.

“By *who*?”

The fear dripped from Arten’s eyes, squeezed out by Okin’s force. His vision spelled true horror, but he wasn’t looking at Okin.

Okin twisted his neck to discover the destination of Arten’s gaze.

On the rooftop where he crouched before, stood another. The cold, silver moonlight hailed down its back, and the warm fire of the church’s windows radiated its front, its curved mask of doom. 

“Please, I’ll resign,” Arten’s voice teared, breath leaking through each word. “But you have to go. For both our sakes, you have to go.”

Okin’s short seconds as the predator ended as he stared into the unmoving masked figure. His Bravery shrivelled.

He released his grip on Arten. The man fell to the ground with a gasp. Water splashed at Okin’s feet.

He turned sprinted off into the darkness. A sharp gust of wind billowed behind him, but he didn’t look back.
