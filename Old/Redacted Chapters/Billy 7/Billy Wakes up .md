Billy nursed a bottle in his arms as he lay on the bed inside the cramped cabin. Bringing the bottle up to his lips, he dripped the last few drops of the brown liquor into his mouth. He could taste a faint oaky tinge to the drink, it was a Trentanian whiskey, dutifully squired by Allia in apology. If she could do one thing right, it wasn’t picking out a drink.

The boat rocked and the bottle rolled out of Billy’s limp hand and onto the ground. He mumbled a curse before doing his best to reach it.

It had been four days since his conversation with Allia, and it seemed in that time the girl had turned even Benjamin to her side. For the love of money, what was the girl doing to them? The deal was too good, it was simple. No commitment, no cost, and they would have all their needs seen to? He understood why Damian took the deal, he always had trouble seeing beyond the shiny surface of people’s intentions. But Benjamin? He was Apathasawian, born and raised. Of all people, he had to understand that all deals came with a price. You practically couldn’t take a shit without signing some contract stating how much you’d pay and how long you’d use it for. What had she said to make him agree? Did she outline some sort of secret deal with him that she simply wasn’t telling the rest of them? Not likely, yet there was something Benjamin wasn’t telling him. 

“Billy?” Damian’s voice came through the cabin door. “We’re almost here, if you want to come above deck.” 

Billy groaned slightly before swinging his legs over the side of the bed. “Yeah, just give me a sec, won’t ya?”

Maybe now he could find out what Allia *actually* wanted from them.
