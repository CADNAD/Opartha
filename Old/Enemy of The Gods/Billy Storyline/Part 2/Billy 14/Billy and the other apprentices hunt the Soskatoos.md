“Alright,” Beryl said, stopping the group of a dozen or so apprentices. “I think most of you know the drill. Jerel has convinced me to let the lot of you use guns, though I think that makes this  too easy. Still, these *are* Soskatoos,”  Whoever brings me back the most corpses wins.”

Beryl nodded to the three holding the large, wooden stick, and one of them stuck it into the ground. At the end of the stick, now the top, waved a bright green flag. 

“Every time you make a kill, bring the corpses back here. Kerlo here will make the tallies,” Beryl motioned to a thin, pale man holding a clipboard. “While this is a competition, I expect respectful practice and will be wandering around to monitor your technique and strategy.”

The Dakung nodded to his apprentices, who surrounded the flag in a circle. He raised his right arm and they all turned away to the surrounding back of the beast.

“Three!”

Billy looked out into the wilderness.

“Two!”

He spotted one of the beautiful, multi-coloured birds off in the distance.

“One!”

He readied his arm on his hip, narrowing his eyes on those vibrant feathers.

“Go!”

Billy sprinted right for the coloured sillouhette, picking at one of the many installed fields on the back of the beast. Another apprentice who looked a few years older than Billy but much more clean and refined must’ve spotted the same one, as he took off a bit behind Billy.

Billy didn’t even look behind, the other guy was eating his dust. The individual feathers of the Soskatoo became clearer, and Billy wrapped his fingers around his holstered weapon. There was no sign of the other apprentice, he must’ve been way behind as his footsteps couldn’t be heard. Billy slowed Time, sliding across the ground, his boots kicking up that chalky red residue. 

His boots grinded against the ground, and he released Time a bit, allowing himself to draw his weapon. The reverence the other apprentices had given it, the bird was probably extremely agile, but Billy took that into consideration and already lined up his weapon by the time the creature turned its thin, black neck---

The Soskatoo dissapeared into thin air. 

Billy grinded to a halt, catching his leg. The red soot blew in his face, causing him to cough.

“Idiot,” Billy turned his head. The other apprentice who had come after this Soskatoo shot him a glare before spinning his revolver into its holster.

“Well you didn’t fucking get it either,” Billy said, dusting off his chaps\[ might change to monastery clothing\]  and returning a hostile stare.

“That’s because you decided to rush in there like a moron and let it teleport away,” the apprentice replied, doing a quick panorama of the surroundings.

“Never fucking played this game before,” Billy said. 

“Alright,” the other man said. “Well, don’t do that.”

The apprentice simply walked away to the south, getting into a crouched position. Billy shot daggers at his back, forming a fist but just standing there as the man sleuthed away.

Turning away from him, Billy spit on the ground, and then kicked it, which blew up another plume of dust, much of it hitting him before blowing away backwards with the wind.

He hit his own body to blow off the red residue. His teeth were clenched and he tensed his jaw, preparing to scream at the sky.

Instead, he let out a deep exhale, relaxing his formerly clenched fist. He *was* having a good time training with Breslo, putting a smile on every once in a while for Damian and Benjy. It wasn’t perfect by any means, but this was an opportunity to move forward, to hopefully leave some of that darkness behind. It pained him, but he would try his best.

He scanned the area. The apprentice who had slighted him was in a crouched position, approaching a feeding Soskatoo, probably the one that had teleported away from Billy. He really had maintained a snail’s pace, not even kicking up a hint of debris with his slow steps.

Billy copied his stance, but snuck toward the Soskatoo with wider steps, in a more direct line. The bird kept pecking at a juvenile plant, oblivious to the two men approaching it.

The other apprentice, still sneaking, pulled out his gun and aimed it at the bird.

Billy knelt on one knee and drew his own. He was much farther than the other man, much farther than he’d normally take a precise shot from. But put his non-firing arm under the gun’s grip, slowed Time, and the brilliant feathers fell under his sight.

Smoke blew away from his gun, and the explosive sound blew through the sky. A harrowing yelp came from the bird, and it vanished. The other apprentice whipped his head from his target to a crouched Billy, eyes wide. Billy lowered his gun and scoured the surroundings, and the other man quickly followed suit.

There, around a hundred metres toward the edge of the beast, the same distance from Billy and the other man, the bird lay on the ground, twitching in a pool of its own blood.

Billy sprinted for it, and the other man quickly dashed off as well.

He got there first, whipping around with his gun over of his left leg, which stopped the other man in his tracks.

“It’s mine,” Billy said. The apprentice took a step back, and Billy did a flip with his weapon before sliding it in his holster.

The man grumbled, spitting to the side.

“Should’ve been faster. I even gave you a head start,” Billy said.

The apprentice dusted off his robes, glaring at Billy. “You didn’t even kill it. It just bled out and died.”

“I was just giving the pro another chance to show his skills,” Billy smirked. “But he must be feeling really generous today, cause it looks like I got here first.”

The man just sputtered, walking away from Billy and the dead bird.

Billy turned back to the Soskatoo, squatting down. His nose scrunched and he drew away from the corpse, only briefly glancing back as he squatted down to pick up the creature by the neck. Blood dripped from its open wound, some spilling onto his hand.

He grabbed its neck with the other hand, grimacing, and shook the blood off. Then he trekked back to the green flag, leaving a trail of dripping blood from the original pool.

“Ah, Billy, you got one,” Beryl said, and the thin scribe, Kerlo jotted it down on his clipboard. “Impressive. Most of the time the newbies don’t even catch one the whole game. Yep, the guns are probably making this too easy, but then again, at least we actually hunt ‘em down, instead of it just being a, you know, wild Soskatoo chase.”

Billy threw the corpse into a pile of half a dozen or so next to the flag. Though they were all dead, the radiant feathers were even more vibrant than the lime-green flag. 

“These things are actually quite pretty,” Billy said. “Wouldn’t mind keeping some of those feathers for myself.”

“A lot less pretty when they ravage through your farms and threaten starvation,” Beryl said. “And we do make clothing and decorations out of the feathers.”

Billy nodded. “Well I guess I’ll go shoot another.”

Scanning the plains, there were none to be found that weren’t already in the clutches of one of the apprentices, so he just continued southward. The whooshing of the beast’s wings made it hard to hear any sounds the Soskatoos might’ve made. There were several times he went off in one direction, thinking he spotted one of the birds, just for it to be killed by another of the apprentices.  

After a while of running in circles, he heard footsteps from behind. Beryl approached Billy, staff in hand.

“Having some trouble, are you?” Beryl asked. 

Billy nodded, speeding up his strut. “I don’t think we needed this many to hunt down these birds.”

“Well that’s part of the competition, isn’t it?” Beryl asked, catching up to Billy’s side. 

Billy grunted.

“Tell you what. It looks like you’re just running around, getting there only after others have already fought over the boon. Sometimes the best thing to do is to take a step back from the conflict and wait for your best shot,” Beryl said.

Billy stopped, turning to face Beryl. 

“So I should just sit here and wait for one of those things to come along?” 

Beryl smiled as he took a seat on a natural little bump on the ground. “Hey, worst comes to worse, and you got to relax while all my other silly students are running around shooting the air.”

Billy relented, taking a seat next to his master. Beryl stared out into the bright, blue sky.

“There ain’t a lot of time of the year we get to admire the sky without leaving *Tehwa Kanura.* Might as well spend the little time we got.”

Billy squinted against the radiant blur. 

“Sometimes I don’t know if Kan’s cloaking is really ‘perfect’, as the rest of them say. It lets us shield ourselves, but doesn’t discriminate what it lets in. Even hides us from the light.”

Billy scratched the little stubble on his chin. “Maybe that’s a good thing too, though. To be honest, I think living on a flying monster is a little looney, but those clouds it makes, yeah, that’s pretty good. Enough light sinks through anyway. All you need is enough light to see.”

“These days are enjoyable, but the cloak is necessary. Well, I guess that’s what makes these days so enjoyable,” Beryl smiled.

“I respect privacy myself, but you guys are a little...intense about it. Wouldn’t you guys be really worried when this thing releases its cloak?” Billy asked.

“It’s always at the same time every year, over the northern part of the Kiatus Ocean,” Beryl said. “Only people who have a chance of spotting us are sailors, and everyone knows sailors are superstitious.”

Billy nodded, staring out into the red rough. A couple of apprentices were running toward them, features still unrecognizable in the distance.

A blunt forced hit Billy in the shoulder; it was Beryl’s elbow. The elder man gestured forward with his chin.

Billy turned. The Soskatoo looked right up at him with black, beady eyes, rainbow feathers glimmering in the sun.

Slowing Time, Billy fumbled for his weapon, his own reflection glowing brighter in the bird’s eyes, the edges of the Soskatoo fading. Sweat leaked from his armpits, and his heart beat in an exponential rhythm; the bird would disappear in the coming moment, but actually moving in Time Slow was painstaking. His brain commanded every muscle in his arm from shoulder to finger, all moving like concrete against him.

He drew the gun, releasing Time, and fanned the hammer. 

Five dark bulletholes steamed up from the ground. The bird was gone, and only a feather left behind. 

Billy popped up. The bird was nowhere to be seen, and the two apprentices slid to a stop ahead of him and Beryl, bending over and panting. Beryl himself sighed and shook his head.

“Sometimes just taking one focused shot is better than showing off and losing all your bullets,” Beryl said. “There’ll be times like that where you only have one shot and then it’s too late.”

Billy grunted, throwing his empty gun on the ground. The light glared in the corner of his eye.

One of the hunched men looked up. He had the dark eyes of the apprentice Billy had squabbled with earlier, and the man gave Billy a sneer.

“Ah, so this asshole stole yet another one, and yet again failed to nail it,” the apprentice said. 

Billy turned away from the man, away from the sun, but the light shone brighter, emitted from within his mind. He stared out at the mountains, but they were invisible to him.

“How do you even miss a shot that close?” The apprentice’s throat shook with venom.

Billy cried violently, but no water left his eye.\[ Cried out, right?\]

“It was the light,” he murmured. It flashed before him again, and his tiny hand trembled in the darkness.

The man let out a sardonic laugh. “The *light*? You missed a shot because of the *light*? What kind of coward---“

Billy spun and smashed his fist into the man’s cheek, causing the man to topple backwards. Beryl jumped out of his seat, along with the other man who was catching his breath--- Jerel. The two reached wide arms between Billy and the fallen apprentice, who wiped the blood off his lips, still sneering at Billy. The cowboy pushed forward with the rage of the storming seas, only held back by the dam that was Beryl.

“Forces, Billy, calm down!” Beryl shouted, holding Billy’s writhing shoulders in place.

Billy pushed Beryl’s hands away, glaring at the befallen apprentice. “Fuck your Forces! That asshole, he---“

“*Billy!*”

Beryl’s expression darkened and the light faded from Billy’s eyes. The rise of his chest and beating of his heart became clear, and he stepped back from Beryl’s sunken, murderous face.

“I’m going to have to ask you to surrender,” Beryl said, his usual uncle-like voice gone, a judiciary tone filling the void.

“Why---“

In a blur, Beryl pulled out one of the many revolvers from his bandolier and cocked it at Billy.

Billy instinctively slowed Time and reached for his holster, which of course, was empty. Beryl kicked back Billy’s dropped gun to Jerel.

“You are under arrest for blasphemy,” Beryl glanced back to the bloodied apprentice, who Jerel was helping on his feet. “And assault of a Hylong. Put your hands behind your back.”
