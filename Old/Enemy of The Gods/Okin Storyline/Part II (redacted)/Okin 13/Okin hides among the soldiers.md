Trenton strode confidently through the bustling streets of the middle ring, waving with a smile as Rothars and Athers bowed around him reverently. Okin made sure walk with his neck hung down, hiding his face with his hands, but Gendro wasn’t as cautious. Part of Okin wanted to tell the Rothar to hide his features, but he ultimately decided against it.

Every building, the fortresses, bunkers, dining halls and housing units all looked the same: stone brick castles with minimal windows and maroon tops. There was minimal space between buildings and the street, and the tall watchtowers and multi-levelled castles shadowed over the entire street.

Finally, Trenton turned to the door of one of the castles, knocking. A skinny boy with a pale but youthful face opened the door, his childish eyes widening further as he saw the grinning old man.

He turned back inside, leaving the door open. 

“Captain! Captain! It’s an Impalias!” 

The sound of heavy steel steps shook the hall.

A towering man completely incased in armour peeked through the door. Unlike the standard steel colour, his was dark yet still shiny, with massive shoulder plates and ringed bracers. He held his helmet under his right arm, which was large and square, with three vents near the mouth and a larger one for the eyes. He had a square, plain face and a thick black moustache and top.

“Impalias Trenton,” the Devinar bowed. “How may I serve you today?”

“There is nothing you need do for me,” Trenton replied. “I would merely like to request a favour for my dear friends here. This is High Ather Okin, and this here is Rothar Gendro.”

Gendro bowed, and the Devinar gave a brief nod, welcoming the three inside. The young boy closed the large wooden door shut with the push of his entire body, and then ran off up one of the many stone staircases in the main hall of the garrison. The interior of the fortress was just as plain as the outside: minimal wooden furniture and arched doors, with the same stone brick inner walls and flooring. 

“It seems that my friends have been the targets of someone with a lot of power who does not share our interests, to the point that their lives have been threatened. This was the only safe place I could think of,” Trenton said.

The Devinar raised a sharp, black eyebrow. “So you want us to protect these two?”

Trenton shook his head. “Not just protect, I want you to disguise them amongst the trainees. They have no idea who could be after them, so *no one* can know of their true identities. They have many other important tasks to perform, so expect that they will be missing many of your drills.”

The tall man nodded. “Your wish is my command, Impalias Trenton. I will protect these men with my life.”

“Good,” the Impalias smiled. “Well, it seems my work here is done. Okin,” Trenton turned to the Ather, holding the side of his hand, looking into his eyes. “I wish you luck in this path that you’ve been put on. It sounds more difficult than the trials of many, but it is the hardest tests that show the strongest Dedication.”

Okin nodded, and the Impalias smiled, waving good-bye to the Devinar before excusing himself from the garrison. 

“You may follow me,” the Devinar said to Okin. Turning to Gendro, he said,  “You, stay here.” For once, the Rothar did as commanded without argument. Okin followed the Devinar through the hall and up one of the curved staircases. At the top was a door with iron boards, and he unlocked it. 

It was a large storage room with dozens of identical sets of steel armour and gambesons hung from armour stands. 

“Grab one of the gambesons, and then knock on the door when you’ve changed.” the Devinar said. “I can hold your robe and make sure it’s safe.”

Okin removed his white robe, revealing his plain, grey undergarments. The Devinar closed the door after Okin handed them to him.

After changing into one of the brown, puffy defensive jackets similar to Gendro’s, Okin followed the Devinar back down the stairs. 


The other trainees sat at tables, chatting amongst each other loud enough to cover up the defeaning footsteps of the Devinar. They remained oblivious as the three men entered the room, continuing their clambering and stuffing their mouths with food.

“Attention!” The captain’s booming voice silenced the room. “These two are going to be staying with us here, but they have many important duties to attend to, so they will often be excused from training. I expect that you all will treat them with the respect that any Rothar of The Citadel deserves!”

“Sir yes sir!” The group shouted in unison.

The Devinar exited the room, leaving the two new recruits standing awkwardly in the middle. As soon as the door had slammed shut, the men turned back to their plates and their babbling. 

Gendro took an empty seat between two men confidently, and was already receiving handshakes and smiles. Okin stepped forward nervously after Gendro, his unfamiliar apparel matching the rest of the group. 

*I bet they can already tell I’m not one of them.* 

“Would you like a seat? There’s one right here!”

The offer had come from the farthest table on the right. A large, dark-skinned man with a small scar across his cheek had invited Okin to sit down at his bench. The man smiled, and he walked over to take the seat. 

The table was shorter than the others, and much less packed. Across from the dark-skinned man sat two others, both younger, scrawnier men with short light brown hair and bright blue eyes. They ignored Okin as he sat down.

“Ashkar, nice to meet you,” the man held out a thick hand which was slightly covered in sauce, and Okin took it reluctantly.

“My name is... Salwin. Nice to meet you as well,” the Ather replied, releasing his now wet hand and wiping it against the table leg.

“You want some?” Ashkar asked, holding out his bowl which was stuffed with pile of upilek stew and rice, and it appeared by the slop on his face that he had eaten quite a bit already.

“I am fine, thank you,” Okin replied, pushing the bowl away slightly. 

Ashkar shrugged. “It’ll be ha-ord to fight if you don’t eat.”

One of the bony boys spoke up from the other side of the table.

“Didn’t you hear Captain Maklo? This boy ain’t gonna be doing lots’o fighting.”

*Uh oh.*

Surprisingly, the other thin, identical-looking boy argued back. 

“The way things are going, we *all* gonna be doing lots’o fighting.”

The first boy to speak rolled his eyes, groaning, and the large man cringed.

“Ah, here comes Dubli again, with all his genius political theories,” the first boy said.

The second boy elbowed the first. “You know it’s true! It’s nothing unexpected, and they been all talking about it!”

The two boys, who Okin was now sure were brothers, continued yelling at each other, swinging around their utensils wildly. 

The giant man leaned over to Okin. “Just ignore them. They always do this.” 

“What are they even arguing about?” Okin asked.

The large man stopped eating. 

“Dubli thinks that wa-or is going to come back,” he said.

His eyes were serious, his lips not sad, but solemn. 

*This man is Farsunni--- and the only war he could be talking about is the Farsun Conflict.* 

Farsun had been part of a united Wreathward for centuries, its leader--- the Jalai--- electing to join with the other kingdoms and unite under Versalism. But, Farsun had a vastly different culture and a much larger population of Dark Heralds, which created high tensions between it and the rest of Wreathward. \[ 2021-03-01, 3:56 PM

Several towns and villages rebelled against the clergy, hiding the servants of Tregale, which ignited a conflict between the Farsunni leaders and the rest of Wreathward. While tensions were rising, Farsun was still legally at peace with its neighbouring nations and still a part of The Citadel officially. \[ 2021-03-01, 3:56 PM

That is, until the Farsunni armies launched a surprise attack on a group of Whenranish villages, sending their hordes into Whenranish territory and ransacking it. The rest of the Wreathwardian nations quickly came together to quell the Farsunni threat.\[ 2021-03-01, 3:56 PM

The Jalai formerly surrendered to The Citadel some thirty years ago, and promised that Farsun would pay ample reparations--- along with carrying out the execution of Dark Heralds in their nation. But, as Farsun officials spite the laws of The Citadel, the actual enforcement of these laws have been slim. There have been rumours for decades that Farsun would rise up and break the peace deal, but Okin never thought that day would come.

*The last thing we need right now is war. Farsun may be corrupt, but we should make sure our own house is in order first.*

“And why would the war come back?”  Okin asked the dark-skinned man.

“I heard from one of the Devinars talking to an *Impalias* down near the Cathedrals!” Dubli interrupted. “They said that it’s being discussed at the Seat!”

“What you gonna do, Ashkar? If we fight Farsun, you gonna leave and fight for them or stay and fight with us?” Dubli asked.

“I was born here,” Ashkar said. “This is my home. But, I do not want to ransack the home of my ancestors.”

“Your ancestors attacked us!” Dubli yelled, getting up from his bench. “You support the worship of Deionis and Tregale, and it shows, you stabbed us all in the back!”

Ashkar slammed his fist on the table. 

“I have already decla-ored my allegiances. I will not a-orgue with you, Dubli.”

Dubli’s brother grabbed his brother’s shoulders, bringing him back down to the bench.

“Sorry, Ashkar. Dubli’s nervous, is all,” he said.

“I understand,” Ashkar said, finishing his meal with one last big swallow. “As I said, I fear wa-or more than anyone here.”

The boy who opened the door for Okin came around to the table, carrying a large stack of dirty bowls and cutlery. Ashkar placed his plate atop the stack, thanking the kid.

The rest if the tables began dispersing toward the main hall, and Okin followed behind the two brothers and Ashkar, who were last in line. Peeking forward, he could see that they were approaching the army dorms. It was time for bed, but the beggar’s words rang in his ears.

*Return to me at sunset tonight. Then, you will find the truth.*

Okin stepped away from the group, but was noticed by the large Farsunni. 

“Where a-ore you going?” Ashkar asked.

“I---I have to get something from the captain,” Okin replied.

Ashkar nodded, turning back to the line. Not the first time Okin’s lies had worked out.

The High Ather ran down the steps of the garrison, unlocking the front door and sprinting out into the streets of The Citadel. A few weeks ago, Okin would close his curtains an hour before dawn, rarely stepping into the darkness, and never without a bright lantern. Now, it seemed as if the night was his time to act.

He rushed through the barren streets, preparing himself for the next step in his fight for Justice.
