“What?” Okin’s eyes widened.\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-20 3:17 PM

Possibly add dialogue about Okin accusing Aldwin of lying to everyone\] The glare of the sun left his eyes and all became sharp. Previa’s childlike glimmer was clear, but it seemed now like the face of a too-porcelain doll.

“He--- he was *happy---* even *excited* that I had even asked,” the young Ather went on, “He didn’t ask about you, Okin. He-he just told me that yes, it was a real text, but--- it is difficult to understand,” Previa’s eyes lit up. “That is why not many know of it, or are told of it.”

Okin couldn’t look at anything except the ground now, which encroached upon him. He felt like a toddler again, barely able to hold himself upright and only a couple feet high at that. The bushes that he touched earlier, they looked so menacing in the corner of his eye; if he even leaned slightly his eyeball would be pierced by their spears.

“Okin? Okin?” 

Okin fell towards the voice, and he felt his shoulders slump into Previa’s hands. He looked up, and his nose was only inches away from Previa’s. Okin instinctively backed away.

“Are you alright?” Previa asked.

Okin regained his composure, as much as he could manage.

“Are you... are you *sure* that this is true? That is what he told you?” Okin held out a shaky finger at Previa.

“Yes. Yes! That was exactly what father said,” Previa replied.

Okin turned away from Previa so he could let his expression of grotesque outrage be free. Why would Aldwin lie to him so many times like that? What could *Aldwin,* a man who had been present in his life since before Okin could speak a word, be hiding from him? Okin wanted to squeeze both sides of his head and push out an unadulterated scream.

“We--- you can come in and ask him yourself,” Previa said. “I’m sure he---“

Okin whipped around and seized Previa by the shoulders. A few fruits dropped from Previa’s basket.

“Do not *ever* speak to him about this again,” Okin’s voice was deep and he glared Previa in the eyes. He hated to be so stern to someone he saw as an innocent boy, but this--- whatever this was, it could not lie in that boy’s clumsy hands.

Previa nodded, but he couldn’t meet Okin’s eyes.

“Only talk about it if he brings it up again, and do not use my name. If he asks you who told you---“ Okin’s lips froze.

Previa slowly looked up to Okin’s face. 

“You--- you would ask me to lie?”

Okin’s lip quivered. He squeezed his eyes shut and pressured his temples with his fingers. He--- he would never do something like *this*, but if Aldwin really was keeping a conspiracy this damning in the shadows--- was Okin’s vocation in danger?  Was *he* in danger?

Okin met Previa’s eyes. The Arbiter of Truth had told him to be upfront, to be honest, and he had done his best. Would he really end that now, just because he was met with the dishonesty of another?

“No, no, Aredal, of course I cannot ask you to lie. Do not--- do not lie. But I--- I do not know what to do, Previa. I am--- Aredal, my Dedication is weak, but I am *afraid,* Previa.”

Okin’s will was failing, and his eyes began to water a little. He leaned down to wipe them with the back of his hand. 

Previa reached over to give Okin a comforting pat. Despite his shame, Okin gave a small smile.

“Oh-oh-Okin--- your--- your finger is bleeding,” Previa said. “It’s---“

Both Previa and Okin looked to Previa’s shoulder. The formerly immaculate white robe was stained dark crimson.

“I--- I’m so sorry, Previa,” Okin said. “I’ll give you the steltells to reimburse The Citadel.”

“Don’t worry about it, Okin,” Previa said. “I know you’ve got a lot of land to till.”

Previa gave one last smile before continuing on past Okin into Aldwin’s manor.

“Wait!” Okin shouted.

Previa turned around. 

“Did he tell you what the Fourth Book of Nexon was about?” 

Previa gave a curt nod.

“It’s about the war.”

With that, he unlocked the door and stepped back into the manor. The door clicked in front of Okin for a second time.

Okin stood there, flabbergasted. Thoughts of anger, confusion, and even a bit of unwashed hate battled in his mind. He turned around towards the open streets of the city. His feet moved him forward, though he did not command them. Carriage drivers yelled, men shouted, and horses neighed; at him? He did not know, and he could not care. Billy, The Synodontis, Aldwin, and this Fourth Book of Nexon--- that was all that was around him. And all of it was far too much to bear. 

So he wandered down the streets, wherever his feet would take him. Part of him hoped he would end up home.
