The people gave Okin some strange looks as the Ather made his way back towards the grave. It was not customary for a religious official to leave a ceremony before the mass of the people had left, and even stranger for him to bring a new guest----who was not dressed for the occasion.

Nonetheless, some of the attendees smiled as the stout, old man approached. Okin’s father smiled back. 

“I apologize for leaving before the ceremony was concluded,” Okin said to the gathering. “This man deserves more respect then that.” The people just stood in acceptance, and Okin turned back to the gravestone, putting his hands together in prayer. But from within the crowd, someone spoke up.

“Why did you leave the ceremony?” It was a high-pitched, feminine voice.

Okin turned to the crowd, looking for who asked the question, but he couldn’t identify who it was.

“I went to see the commotion that many of you saw,” he replied.

The people once again stood in acceptance, focusing back to the grave. It had been settled, and Okin did the same. 

But again, the same voice rose.

“But what was the commotion?”

Okin turned to where he heard the voice coming from. But the crowd was too close, and the headdresses and non-descript black tunics and coats made it impossible to identify the heckler. Okin didn’t want to answer the question, but of course, honesty was the way of the men who followed the Gods.

“The town guards had arrested two men, who had come from the main road," Okin replied.

This response now sparked unrest from the gathering. This time, the heckler didn’t need to push. The others did it for her.

“But why did they arrest these men?” A man with a thin, elderly face asked. “What were they doing out here?”

Okin bit his lip. Now this was a question he definitely didn’t want to answer, as he wasn’t sure the people were ready for the truth-especially considering they were the very people who had come to honour this man on his Half Decadem.

But Okin knew that telling the truth, as always, was the right choice. *Aredal 1:24: Being honest when it suits you is easy, it is being honest when it doesn’t that is honourable.*

Still, he hesitated, drawing his breath. “The two men were arrested- and took to trial at The Church of Revictus--- as it is believed that they were responsible for the murder of Lionos Gruissem.”

There was audible shock. Gasps escaped the mouths of the gathering, as men turned to their wives, spouting their instinctual opinions about the murderers.

“How fitting. The Gods deliver us justice at the Half Decadem ceremony," an older man with round glasses and an even rounder belly said.

“A man who has done something so evil as killing his father cannot escape the Aredal’s Justice--- no matter how far he runs," a younger man with dark hair added.

Okin’s eyes crossed as the gathering continued to spew their judgement on the dissidents. Only his father still paid attention to the Ather, tapping him on the shoulder to break his trance. 

“Let’s go," Okin’s father spoke, his words quickly being covered by the incessant chatter. “The ceremony is over.”

Okin followed his father out of the ceremony, the gathering had not broken up, and the chatter among families had now become a loud, unmoderated discussion. Lionos’s grave was now just another set piece.

Okin turned back to look at the people, it was uncustomary for an Ather to be the first to leave a ceremony. Well, today was quite an uncustomary day.

After they had gotten far enough away so that the cemetery was out of view, Okin turned to his father.

“I thought you wanted some time to pay respects to Lionos.”

“Eh, I can do that tomorrow. It’s not the date that matters, it’s the reverence given to the memory," the old man replied. “And that, well, it wasn’t exactly reverent.”

Okin smiled; his father wasn’t a member of the Versalist Ordain, but he adhered to their values better than much of the order.

“I am most surprised that the kid Damian is still with that bastard. Who follows a man who murdered his own father? Unless maybe that’s someone else," Okin’s dad said.

“No, it definitely is Damian, he’s the right age and has the right features," Okin replied. “To be honest, I think he just has nowhere else to go.”

Okin’s father nodded lazily, his eyes drifting off into the distant east. After a few moments, he said, “You know what Okin, I don’t want to take any more of your time, I know how busy an Ather can be. Why don’t we just both head down to the trial?”

“Dad, it’s alright. I may never be able to come back to Metheno, and I should have sent a letter so we could’ve at least had a meal together," Okin replied.

“All the more reason for me to go with you to the trial at least,” the old man replied, smiling.

The two men continued down the main road.
