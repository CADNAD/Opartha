Steel bars. It seemed that whether they were in supposedly high-tech and innovative Apathasaw, backwards, traditional Wreathward, or as Benjamin had so eloquently put it, on a *cinking* *flying island,* every jail was simply steel bars and a concrete floor.

There was more evidence that this imprisonment and Billy guessed, slavery, as the cell was more than big enough for the three of them. \[ 2021-04-05, 12:38 AM

Not sure what this means\]

“I cinking knew, we shouldn’t have trusted these cinking people,” Billy said to Benjamin and Damian, who both sat with heads hung to the floor.

“It was your only option,” Benjamin said. “It isn’t your fault.”

Billy’s mouth hung open. “Why are you saying it like you’re not part of this?”

“Because,” Benjamin said. “I did have other option. I could wait and go back to Apathasaw. You could not.”\[ Not sure if this should be an option for him\]

Billy’s glare softened, and he nodded. This trip had been a failure, and he still beat himself up for not being able to see his father. But that didn’t mean that Benjamin still hadn’t made sacrifices for him.

“I’m sorry, Benjy,” Billy said. “I’m sorry you had to go through all of---this, even though it was just a favour. You really did me a solid.”

Benjamin laughed. “I am not mad one, Billy. Just---disappointed,” the massive man let out a deep sigh.

“I really wanted to learn more about my Heraldry.”

For a brief moment, Billy remember how much he wanted to go to the Time Institute of Trenta back when he was a teen, just before his dad was killed.

“Who knows,” Billy said. “Maybe when we get back home, as payback for all this shit, I can save up some and pay to get you some training.”

Benjamin gave a toothy smile, and Billy’s lips did curl up a little as well. The smile turned into a scowl though, as he thought back to the fact that---currently, he was absolutely paperless.

He scratched his head as he looked back to Benjamin. He had never paid the man the back half of the money, although *technically*, Benjamin hadn’t given him the service of returning to Apathasaw.

“I-I realize you never also got the money, and--- well, they took it all back in Metheno. I’m guessing that’s why you waited at the bar---cause you’d thought I’d be there and wanted to get paid,” Billy said.

Benjamin let out a hearty laugh. “Billy, I am man with talent! A few paper not worth so much to me. I wait for you and Damian, make sure you are safe. That’s why I come to this---place.”

Billy smiled. Being surrounded by these sycophants made him forgot how earnest his old friend could be. He grimaced as he remembered how anal he was about the beer back on the ship. He had treated Benjamin like cinking shit, and of all people Billy knew, the man was the last to deserve it. Without Benjamin, Billy wouldn’t have even had the chance to see his father. The chance that still, was ripped away from him. By *Okin*, of all people.

Billy’s hand’s twitched into a claw shape. He hadn’t had the time to think about Okin since he was back in the cell in Wreathward. Ironic, those thoughts were interrupted by Damian’s whining and the girl’s blinding appearance.

And once again, they were.

“Hello,” the three men turned to see the dark-haired woman who had ‘read’ them before. Hanaata gave her awkward, almost unsettling\[ 2021-04-03, 10:30 AM

Maybe add a sedative like tea to this sequence\] smile, and behind her were four \[add further description if you wish \]armoured men, without a hint of smiles between them.

“I’m sorry that you’ve had to be locked up like this. We’ll be able to let you out in a short moment, if you just comply with me for a short minute,” she somehow widened her already stretched smile. 

“So---we go back to Wreathward?” Benjamin asked.

“Yes,” Hanaata replied. “As soon as you just do what I ask. It is very simple.”

“What do you want, lady?” Billy asked, slamming his hands against the bar. The metal shook toward her, but Hanaata stayed deathly still. “What is this weird shit that you psychos are after?”

“It will be rather painless,” she said, stalking forward to the cell bars. Only inches away, the cracked lips of the woman’s smile towards inhumanly upward. “Please, it will be easiest if you place your scalp against an open space in the bars, one at a time.”

Billy cocked an eyebrow. “You’re going to kill us? All that manipulating, just to kill three random guys from Apathasaw?” 

“No, no, no. That would be barbaric. Although---that is an alternative, if you wish,” her smile definitely *was* unsettling.

“Why---what are you to do?” Benjamin asked. 

The woman took a gasp for air, then returned to her overly host-like posture. 

“We cannot have you remember this location, or anything you saw here. It would put us all at risk. However, we do not wish to harm you, especially considering that you are gifted by The Forces. So, we will wipe your minds. Ah---only the events from the past few days, of course.” she flashed her pearly teeth again.

“So---you won’t harm us? And we won’t even remember what happened here?” Billy asked.

She nodded several times. “Yes. Judging from the three of you, you will likely wake up behind bar, thinking that you merely passed out.”

“I---I don’t drink,” Damian said.

“Ah. We can find other accommodations for you, then,” she said. “Your scalps, if you may.”

Damian rubbed his hand quietly but stepped forward, as did Benjamin. The lot of them were cinking idiots. Billy wheeled around and gave both a hard stare. The younger man’s gaze wilted, but he took another step.

“Damian,” Billy’s voice was a quiet whisper of a command. Slowly, Damian moved his foot back. A sigh of relief passed through Billy, they had some sense at least. 

“These men are not simply for show. If you refuse to come voluntarily, than we will use force.” Though Billy couldn’t see the woman’s face, her smile was plain the words. She would enjoy beating them. 

Billy turned back and stuck an arm out in front of Damian. “You can have me all you want, but you’re not laying another cinking finger on him.” 

Hanaata’s brow raised in bemusement before she gestured over her shoulders for the four guards. “Men, always so stubborn. Make this quick won’t you? Every second we deal with this drabble is a waste for us all.” 

“You promise me,” Billy started, moving closer to the bars. “You promise me you won’t hurt my brother.”

“I promise,” Hanaata said, eyes straight.

Did he really have to submit to these psychos? Really, it seemed there was no other choice. It was either that, or they would be punished, or even killed, and Billy couldn’t have that.

Billy shivered, placing his scalp between the iron bars. Hanaata smiled, reaching her hand out toward his head. Billy closed his eyes, bracing for whatever witchcraft this woman was about to cast on him. He didn’t want this, but the smoother the transition, the easier it would be. So he let blackness surround him.

“Stop!” A feminine voice boomed. Hanaata’s fingers slid off his head.
