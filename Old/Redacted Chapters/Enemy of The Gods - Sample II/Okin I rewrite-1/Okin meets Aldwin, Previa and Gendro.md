Okin continued his whistle on his walk back to the church. He strode up the same stone steps to the Ather’s quarters behind the main hall and unlocked the door.

“Previa, I’ve got bread from Mrs. Arlenes!”

Nothing appeared out of ordinary on the main floor; it was still that beige, plain, dining room area with little space to walk around that Okin had come to expect. The only thing he didn’t reccognize was something wrapped up in crinkly, yellowish paper on the windowsill

There was a slight muttering above, and Okin’s attention was drawn to it.  He looked up at the tall spiral staircase that led to his room above.

“Previa?” he shouted again.

Okin placed the basket and his satchel carefully down on one of the cabinets. The symbol of the golden star, identical to the one on his hand, laid face up.

He tiptoed up the stairs, and the muttering became clearer.

“...it seems you’ve fallen in short in that regard, too. Well, I guess as always, I’ll have to make do.”

Okin peeked over the rail, and his eyes widened. There, standing behind his old friend Previa, was a man wearing white and gold robes similar to Okin’s except with a vibrant four-pointed star of Aredal in the centre of his chest. Previa’s father, Impalias Aldwin.

“Impalias Aldwin,” Okin bowed, and Previa turned his head. “I apologize, I was out in the town getting bread.”

Aldwin waved his hand. “Bah,” his wrinkles creased into a warm smile as he hobbled over to Okin. “No matter, I wasn’t waiting long. Good to catch up with my son. It appears that--- despite his usual incompetence--- you’ve taught him well in the past couple years.”

“He has been---,” Okin glanced to Previa, who just looked down to the floor, thin hands clasped in front of his white and gold robes. “He has been improving, yes.”

“I will take your word as good as any,” Aldwin left Previa behind and reached up to pat Okin on the back. “Unfortunately, I did not come only to check up on my son.”

Okin raised an eyebrow, and the Impalias waved his hand as if commanding a dog for his son to come over, and Previa ran up.

“As you probably remember, in a week it is the fifth anniversary of the death of Lionos Gruissem.”  Okin and Previa both nodded solemnly at the name.  “I would love to return home to perform the ceremony myself, but unfortunately The Citadel needs me during this crucial time of integration.  But, I am more than honoured to delegate the position to you, High Ather Okin. You have proven time and time again that you are a pious man, and wise above your years.”

Okin bowed his head.  “I am honoured that you have granted me this opportunity.  I will give everything I have to honour this great man, on the anniversary of his union with the Gods.”

“I am to join him, father?”  Previa raised a finger. It seemed as if both Okin and Aldwin forgot he was in the conversation until this interruption.  The younger Ather looked to the Impalias, his father, with wide eyes.

The Impalias’ smile faded.  “No. Only one Ather is required to perform the ceremony, and you are needed elsewhere, Ather Previa. That is the other reason I came here.”

“But--- but I knew Mr. Gruissem as a young boy! Even if just as an attendee, I would like to pay my respects--- ”

“No. The decision is final.  You will go with me to The Citadel, and Okin will travel to Metheno to perform the ceremony," Aldwin said.

Letting out a disheartened sigh, Previa looked back to the floor. Okin stood still. He was rather shocked at Aldwin’s decision.  *Since when did The Citadel need so many Athers on call?* He thought to himself.  It was not a time of war, in fact, this was the most prosperous time for The Citadel since its establishment. And Previa was no warrior, nor a well-studied religious leader. As Okin was supposed to mentor Previa, he was surprised that the young Ather would not be allowed to join him to perform a ceremony in their hometown.

“Well then,” Aldwin dusted off his hands. “I am sorry for such a short notice. There is so much going on at The Citadel with the new election rounds coming up and such. Gather up everything you need, Previa, I will wait outside and we will be off. And I suppose you will be needing to leave with Rothar Gendro soon if you are to make it on time, Okin.”

The three of them all shared awkward nods, and Aldwin stepped past them and walked down the steps to leave the room. 

“Oh,” Aldwin stopped and turned back to Okin at the top of the descending stairs. “And don’t forget my gift.”

“Gift?” Okin raised an eyebrow.

“I left it on top of the windowsill,” Aldwin gave a soft smile. 

Okin gave an understanding nod as he finally realized what the object wrapped in the crinkly paper was.

Behind him, Previa let out a breathy sigh. Okin turned around. The young Ather’s fists were closed and white, and he turned away from Okin.

“Why are you so upset, my friend?”  Okin asked.

Previa’s eyes met Okin’s. “You don’t get it?  Father always makes me do what he wants.  I just wanted to see home for a little while, and pay our respects, but for some reason I got to go off and do some chores at The Citadel.”

Okin wrapped his arm around Previa’s back and gave him a friendly pat.  “Being summoned to The Citadel is a high honour. The only time I got to go there was for my promotion ceremony.”

Like a child seeing into a window of a candy store, Previa’s eyes lit up.  “You think I am going to be inducted as a High Ather?”

Okin smiled at the excitedness of the guileless Previa. The thought of confirming the truthfulness of this wish, which may in fact be false, crossed Okin’s mind ever so briefly.  But instinctively a line of doctrine from his own God, Aredal, ran through his mind:  *Do not lie.  A man knows when he is lying.  An honest man knows that lying encompasses leaving out important information, or displaying something which may not be true as fact.  Do not meddle in anything of the sort.* 

Okin looked down and away from Previa.  “I’m not sure. It could be, but it is likely something else.” 

Previa’s breath faded away as did his childlike glimmer.  “I guess I don’t really have a choice.”  

He slumped off into his own room, and a pang of shame struck at Okin’s heart.

The High Ather shook his head, regaining himself. Yes, Previa was right, he didn’t have a choice, it was his duty to go to The Citadel and serve his Impalias, just as Okin didn’t have a choice---he had to tell Previa his true beliefs whether they were pretty or not.

Okin strode down the hall, raising an eyebrow when he heard the sound of a high-pitched string instrument coming from behind the doors to his Rothar’s room. He cupped his ear to the door.

“Ohhh, there once was a maiden so fine and so fairrrr, who walked through the forest of old Maniclaire...

“She skipped n’ she hopped ‘till her eyes met a bear. But after only one glance there was love in the air!”

“Gendro! Gendro!” Okin knocked on the door.

“Old bear lover! I pray thou not be a mother!” 

Okin rapped harder. “Gendro, we have to leave!” 

He heard a groan from behind the door, and the music stopped. There was a loud pattering of feet, and the door swung open.

“What?” Gendro’s green eyes filled with annoyance.

“Impalias Aldwin just came by,” Okin said, desperately trying not to shake his head at the absolute mess that was Gendro’s room. “I am to perform the Half Decadem ceremony of Lionos Gruissem, in Metheno.”

“How exciting,” Gendro rolled his eyes. 

“In exactly a week,” Okin narrowed his eyebrows. “Which means that we need to leave *now*,” the High Ather placed a hand to stop Gendro from closing the door.

“Ah, so I need to actually do something,” Gendro shook his head and began picking up clothes off the floor. A cheeky smile formed on his face.

Okin ran into his own room and folded up a pile of robes to place in his satchel. 

He glanced back to see if there was anything else he needed, and after deciding there wasn’t, he blew out the withering candle in the corner of his room.

Okin bounded down the circular stepsand was surprised to find Previa pacing around the lobby.

The young Ather’s green eyes widened upon seeing Okin.

“Okin," Previa said. “I thought about the possibilities for a bit, and realized--- What if I don’t want to be a High Ather?”

*I don’t think you’re going to become one yet anyway*, Okin thought to himself, as pulled his satchel over his shoulder. But he couldn’t say that--- or at least not *that* bluntly. Keeping Previa motivated was important, but maintaining the tenant of Truth--- which Okin had done so flawlessly since his initiation as an Ather--- was infinitely more vital. “You are still very young, Previa, and it takes a lot of effort and Dedication to become a High Ather. It is quite *unlikely* that that is the reason your father is summoning you to The Citadel, but it could be. But if it is, do not make the same mistake I did of doubting yourself. No matter if you are an Ather-in-training\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-20 9:24 PM

Perhaps this needs a title\], or The Mouth of The Gods himself, what is truly important is your Dedication, *our* Dedication, to Truth, Justice, and Bravery,” Okin said, resting a hand on Previa’s shoulder. “Don’t be like I was, my friend. Be Brave.”

Previa smiled. “But you are an amazing inspiration, Okin. You truly are the most Truthful man I have ever met.”

Okin looked down to the ground. “Well, thank you. But... recently I’ve realized that I’ve done quite little in the other aspects of my Dedication. It’s all about balance, Previa. A *true* follower of Aredal, especially one who leads the people as an Ather through example, well he must be the true form of Truth, Justice, *and* Bravery.”

The young Ather stared off into the distance, nodding. 

“Come on, your father is waiting for you,” Okin held open the door for Previa, and his friend smiled before skipping off into the sun towards the gravel road at the front of the church where the two carriages sat. Okin smiled to himself before reaching back to grab his satchel. There was plenty of  room to fit his perfectly folded laundry--- the Ather’s satchels always seemed to hold much more than what appeared possible. 

With an “ah” of realization, Okin remembered Aldwin’s gift and walked around the dining room table to the windowsill. The object was much taller than it was wide, and was cylindrical in shape

He delicately took the paper and rolled it away to see what was inside. It was a tall candle of golden hue.

*Is it?* Okin thought. He held the base of the candle to his face and took a sniff.

Even unlit, the smell was strong, and his nose was filled with warmth. It was a confident smell, yet also comforting. 

Just like what it was supposed to represent, the Light of Aredal.

*I can’t believe Aldwin got one of these for me. Even for an Impalias this would be difficult to get his hands on.*

Okin smiled and rolled the candle back up in the wrapping. He swung his pouch around and found a snug place for the candle within his satchel.

With newfound energy, Okin rushed out of  the quarters. He turned around to lock the door close.

His eyes met his palm as he turned the key. He paused to rub a finger over the image of the small black star and the lone golden triangle which pointed upwards below his middle finger. The lone symbol of Truth.

*If only I had an opportunity, a path, so I could be practice what I preach--- and become a true symbol of Justice and Bravery.*
