Liu hobbled back down the cobbled road, heading west towards the cabins.  The sun was beginning to set, and Liu looked around wearily for any of the other farmhands. They were nowhere to be seen.

Breathing a sigh of relief, he snuck into his cabin.

His drawing of the Imperial soldier greeted him--- but it was torn into pieces, scattered across the floor.

The cabin usually smelt somewhat grim--- that was the reality of living on a farm--- but something inside was beyond rancid. He reached down, feeling around for a set of matches, and after finding one with his hands, lit the candle so he could see the room clearly.

It almost blended in with the brown cabin walls, but was actually lighter than them--- a word spelt out with pig shit across the western wall of the cabin. Backuh.

Liu stepped back from the wall, he grasped his stomach as the bile built up in his throat.

*Why do they keep attacking me, berating me, calling me a traitor? I have never done anything to harm them or Delmia. I am just like them--- but they don’t see me that way. Why?*

Liu held his stomach together, pinching his nose. Limping towards the lone cabinet, he opened it, to find that his clothes were also covered in liquid shit. 

He threw up all over the floor.

Leaning on the desk, he opened the drawer to find his stubby pencil and the pouch that contained all the pay he had earned working for Iago. Grabbing them, he rushed outside, before keeling over and vomiting on the ground once again. 

Liu hobbled back eastwards on the cobble path, until he reached Iago’s manor. Knocking on the door, he heard shuffling and Iago opened the door, holding a wax candle.

“Mr. Iago, I am terribly sorry, but my cabin is covered in feces and I just can’t stay in it without vomiting,” Liu said.

Iago shook his head, exasperated. “Why, why are my other workers so cruel?” Turning back to Liu, “Where are your spare clothes?”

“They were also covered in dung,” Liu replied.

Iago sighed. “It is I who am sorry, Liu. Here, you can sleep on the couch tonight. I will give you extra money to buy clothes once you’re in the academy.”

Thanking Iago, Liu stumbled over to the couch, laying down. 

“I will wake up early tomorrow and scrub the cabin. I just couldn’t stand the stench today,” Liu said, as Iago sat next to him.

“Liu, no. It’s not even your cabin anymore. I will make the people that actually caused this- Cheng and those other lazy bastards, clean up.  You just rest, and prepare for what comes tomorrow--- your new journey, a new life.”

Iago smiled as Liu closed his eyes. The boy was beaten, battered, and rejected, but he still worked hard and stayed honest. Perhaps he was what Delmia really needed.
