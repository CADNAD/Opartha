Trenton’s crowd was quite a bit larger, as he had chosen to speak in public today in the large square next to the marketplace.  It was actually less effective from a political perspective, as only the ordain could vote. He stood atop a couple of cargo boxes which functioned as a makeshift stage.

Okin had gotten to the rally a bit late. Maybe it was strategic, but all the candidates seemed to present themselves at similar times during the day. He was much less nervous wearing the Rothar’s armour here in yet another busy crowd then in the empty church with only other clergy. Most of the anxiety came from the memories of the executions he had seen here which still crept into the eyes of his mind.

“It is true, I am the only candidate running for the Central Whenran district who has had experience being an Impalias already. I believe that I have acquired an ample amount of both Knowledge and Wisdom during my service, which of course is my focus,” the Impalias shouted to the crowd.

*Ironic that Arten also mentioned experience in his speech, even though he is at a disadvantage in that category when compared to Trenton. They are almost using the same rhetoric, but I guess it makes sense, them both being Dedicants of Olitheon.*

“While it is of course most vital that we all focus on the tenants of the Four of which we have chosen to Dedicate ourselves to, we must not forget that the Gods worked together in unity, and only through that were they able to defeat the demons that threatened our world. All of the values of the Gods are crucial, and I must speak on a tenant of Intillia that I believe we must stand for in the near future. That value, of course, is Peace. Opartha is currently the most stable it has been in human history, but there are signs of rising war and conflict. We, The Citadel, the leaders of this world, must ensure that *Peace* is prioritized.”

Okin scratched his chin. Back in Ariska, there had been little signs of turmoil or calls for war, but he heard it mentioned a few times since he had arrived here. Were the rural townsfolk simply too naive and uninformed, or was the packed, militaristic Citadel just prone to panic and rumours?

“But most importantly, I must say that I wish good luck to all the other candidates,” Trenton continued. “I know they are all as committed to the glory and honour of The Citadel as I am.”

*I’m not so sure about that,* Okin thought as Trenton bowed to the crowd, recieving wild applause.  A heavily armoured man\[ Devinar, describe armour more later\]  offered the Impalias his hand so he could safely get down for the box. There were four other guards, who politely blocked the crowd members from getting too close to Trenton.

Trenton and his entourage left in the opposite direction of the main crowd, back toward the centre of the city. Most of the people began dispersing. Okin hurried ahead, zooming past until he was in facing. of Trenton’s frontmost guards

He turned around, walking backwards, stabilizing himself as not to fall on his back in such bulky armour. Trenton and the group came to a confused halt.

The Devinar, who lead the group, barked first. 

“What is the meaning of this, Rothar? Do you not know that you’re standing in the way of an Impalias?”

Okin ignored him, raising his visor so Trenton could see his upper face. 

“Trenton, it’s me. I need to speak to you.”

“O-Okin?” Trenton’s face brightened in shock. He tapped the Devinar on the shoulder, whispering to him. The Devinar nodded.

“Come here, you can speak as we walk back to The Cathedral, but no longer,” Trenton said.

Okin lowered his visor before squeezing in between the rest of the guards, shoulder-to-shoulder with Trenton.

“Previa’s run as Impalias is more sinister than we both assumed,” Okin said, looking down to the short man as they walked.

“What makes you think that?” 

“It is too much to explain now, and if you do believe me, it will be too much for you to think about,” Okin said. “Just be wary, Trenton. Aldwin--- he is plotting against you.”

“I---,”

“But that is not the only reason I came here,” Okin interrupted. “I was surprised to see that this Arten is running, and on such a... similar platform as you, except dare I say weaker. Do you know anything about him?”

“Arten?” Trenton raised a thin, grey eyebrow. “Oh yes, he and I are very good friends. I haven’t seen him much in the past few, or well, several years, but yes, we are very like-minded as we worked together in the past.”

The clunky footsteps clouded Okin’s mind as he tried to think. It was quite strange that the candidates had such high opinions of each other. Was there a falling out that Trenton wasn’t speaking of? Why else would this Arten fight what seemed to be such a losing battle? The older Athers were stuck between Arten and Trenton, he had even heard one say such after Arten’s rally. Both were old men, both were Dedicants to Olitheon, and both shared the same conservative, stability-focused mindset. 

*We must continue our focus on securing votes.* 

The deep, commanding voice of one of the men in Breslo’s strange gathering rung in his head. Arten’s softer, gentler voice joined in next.

*In fact, if anyone besides me should win, it should be him.*

Trenton looked up at Okin with an annoyed expression, probably because the Ather had been so eager to speak with the Impalias but was now walking in silence. That little bit of silence had allowed him to reach daunting realization.

“Arten--- he’s not running to win--- he’s only running to take away votes from you,” Okin sputtered.

“What? That’s ridiculousness,” Trenton said. “Why would he do such a thing?”

“To ensure that Previa wins the election.”

Trenton scoffed. “That’s nonsense. Arten and I are much more like-minded then either of us and the boy.”

“He said himself that if anyone beside him were to win, it should be Previa,” Okin said defiantly. “He is working with them, I am sure of it.”

“Even if I *did* believe you, what can I do? It is Arten’s choice if he wants to run, and I can’t do anything about that. Especially not as another candidate in the race.”

“You are still an Impalias until the day of the election. You can petition to The Mouth of The Gods!” Okin said, perhaps a little too loudly.

“I will do no such thing,” Trenton replied as they approached the archway in front of the Cathedral ere Olitheon. “Go on now, Okin. You do not want to risk being spotted, correct?”

Okin stopped walking as Trenton and his guards continued forward into the Cathedral, the normal Devinars on duty stepping aside for the Impalias and his escort. 

*But you will not win, Trenton. You will not win because* they *will not play fair.*

Okin peered up to the giant statue of the wise Olitheon. The smoothed stone formed an expression of contemplation, further emphasized by the marble hand resting against the chin. While he had ultimately chosen Aredal to Dedicate himself to, he had always respected the values of Olitheon, and actually identified more with the logician of The Four as a child.

Trenton was certainly right about one thing; Okin needed the guidance of all of the Four right now. Clasping his girthy, metal hands together, he closed his eyes and prayed for Olitheon to share some of his Wisdom.\[ 2021-03-07, 5:20 PM
