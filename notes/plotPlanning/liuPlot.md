## Event List

Liu takes the civil service exam. *(intro to Liu as a character and how he thinks)*

Liu is at home with his parents. *(Emphasize the way his family views the Empire and how his parents view differ)* They discuss possible career paths if Liu does not pass the exam. Results were given to the other test takers from his village days ago. An Imperial magistrate arrives to tell Liu that he has been summoned to the capital. He must leave immediately. 

Liu arrives in the provincial capital. He sees posters for the up coming election and see some buildings converted to a more Imperial style of architecture. He is interviewed by Shi when he arrives in the capital. Shi accuses Liu of cheating and asks how he solves certain problems. Shi is impressed and asks Liu if he ever considered military service. Shi speaks a lot about Delmia as a concept hinting at his true allegiance to a free Delmian state. Liu says he just wants to do work and do well by his family. Shi convinces him *(not sure how yet)* and he is sent to the Imperial Military college in the South. Shi accompanies him

The two arrive in the capital and Shi and Liu are friendly. The Imperial Military College is on the outskirts of Isa Naya near the mountains. As they approach the base of the mountains they see other parties arriving. There is a mix of entourages, but most are caravans, palanquins and other signs of wealth. Shi is derisive, but Liu remarks that there is logic that only the affluent are able to secure such placement. Shi explains how the academy operates. Formal instruction will begin in a few days. Liu will be housed and fed, his only need will be to learn. Shi emphasises again the importance of Liu's task. A formal welcome ceremony will take place soon. Shi points out important characters that are also in attendance at the academy. Liu runs afoul of Hai-jin and Bi-ri steps in after to console him. The other man ribs on the aristocratic girl.

The introduction ceremony is also the formal graduation of the graduation class. They are the first class of Delmian Imperial officers. The speech is given by a famous general the Empire. He is a native of Beisan and famous for winning battles in Delmian border skirmishes. He preaches the virtues of obedience to the empire. The ceremony ends and the new recruits are shown to their accommodations. Each one gets a small private room, but the class is grouped in a wing together. 

Class begins. The class of cadets is small, less than 40. Bi-ri talks to Liu was the two meet again. The class covers history and tactics, and begins with a lesson on the most pivotal battle of Gaoleian independence. The battle is laid out and the students asked what they would do. One student gives a straight forward attack, a very Delmian answer. Bi-ri remarks that they should have deployed differently, exploiting Gaoleian reliance on cavalry. He purposes a tactic and several students nod along. The instructor remarks it is a good plan, and asks Hai-jin what she thinks. She says that all the previous plans would have failed because the instructor, like the Delmains in real life missed a key piece of intelligence. The instructor agrees with her, and asks what the missing piece is. She answers and gives a ok solution to the problem. Liu thinks that there was no correct move.

The cadets are put to hand on hand combat. Here you see how the stronger members of the class, that are less strategically minded excel. Liu fights Lou Yi and get destroyed. He recognises that Liu is is east Delmian based on his accent and gives him some tips. 

The cadets have dinner together. They discuss integration, Luo Yi makes fun of Hai-jin for her father. The two have an argument about her position. Bi-ri thinks integration will never be possible, and there will be conflict in the future. Liu says it is possible, he is proof of that. He truly believes there can be a peaceful empire.

A new shipment of muskets arrives at the military academy. The cadets watch the soldiers training with the muskets. Tsu-yin considers them dishonourable and heretical, but Liu thinks they should be making more of them. He thinks that it's ridiculous how they can't make them themselves and have to rely on Aparthasaw. Luo Yi thinks they should try them. Some of the others think it's a bad idea, but Liu advocates for it. Wanting to know more about the weapons. They go down and fire the weapons and Liu surprised by the power and how slow the weapons are. Lou Yi says that the Delmians won't stand a chance against these.

It is announced that there will be a battle excursive against the Imperial Academy in Hai-xing, They will be travelling to the battle. The rules of the battle, and a chain of command is established. 

### Possible Part Divider 

The class of cadets is put into a pitched battle exercise against the Imperial academy in Hai-Xing. The eldest cadets are tasked with the strategy of the battle. It is something like capture the flag over a larger area. There is a briefing on the battle Liu's cadets are tasked with a vanguard move to secure a bridge for the other cadets to cross. They are ambushed trying to cross to establish a bulk head. The battle is chaotic and Liu is knocked into the river as a cavalry charge collapse onto the cadets. He is washed away. 

Liu escapes the current of the river as the sun is setting. He is alone but quickly finds out where he is based on his memorisation of the surveys given to him earlier. He tries to go back up stream to continue to secure the objective. He hears twigs snapping as someone attacks him. He tries to fight them off, and despite his improvement he doesn't stand a chance. Hai-jin stops when she realises its him. She is frustrated and the two briefly argue. They discuss what to do, and she convinces Liu that they should try to finish the battle. They both agree the plan is bad and that they will loose. Liu remembers what Shi and his parents say about living up to his potential and he decides he wants the glory. 

The two burn the reinforcements and manage to escape with the objective. They are pursued and a group led by Bi-ri intercepts them. Tsu-yin knew that Hai-jin would go for the glory. 

### Possible Part Divider 

The Delmian representative is being housed at the academy in Isa Naya.
