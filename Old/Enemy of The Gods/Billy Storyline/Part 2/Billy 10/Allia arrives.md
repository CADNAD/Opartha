Billy sat reclined in a hard wooden chair facing the open door to the outer balcony. Each arm rest was a spiraling helix of vines carved from the wood, it was a miracle the chair even supported him. He scraped his finger along the wood, filling the silence with the unnerving sound. This high up the mountain, not even the voices of the residents in the city below could be heard. It had been nearly four days since Allia had marched them out of the meeting chamber, down The Well, across those all to thin walkways, and finally through snaking tunnels to this apartment. For his part, all Billy had done since arriving in the two bedroom apartment was sleep, drink, and drink a little more. 

He reached across to a small coffee table in front of him and grabbed a glass bottle of a light white liquor. The stench was a familiar tinge to his nose, and the burning in his throat, the comforting embrace of a forlonged lover\[ 2021-04-07, 10:06 AM

Billy might honestly be a virgin\]. He took another and held the sweet white drink in his mouth. It wasn’t like the rich rums he had taken in Apathasaw, nor the spiced whiskey he’d gotten in Metheno. Rather it was an almost fruity alcohol, but nonetheless potent. Since arriving he had sampled ancient Trentanian reds, modern Delmian rice wines, Commonwealth cider and beers, but nothing came close to the fruity liquor he coddled in his arms.  

Billy raised the glasses to his mouth and found one drop of liquor. *They had better have bought another one,* he thought to himself. Gripping the chair of his arm he stumbled over from the square sitting area to the small kitchen near the front door. The apartment itself was fairly spacious, with a bedroom flanking either side of the sitting room, and a large balcony connecting all three rooms on the outside of the mountain. Each bedroom had its own bathroom which even contained running, heated water. But despite having all the fixing of a home, it simply didn’t feel right to Billy. The water was always too hot, he could never find the right side of the bed, and there was never enough alcohol. 

As he threw open a cupboard above the stove, he heard a knock at the door. With the sun still muring into the living room, it was too early for Damian or Benjamin to have returned.

“Who is it?” He yelled out. 

“It’s me, Allia.”

“Couldn’t have come sooner?” Billy slammed the cupboard shut and flung the door open. Allia stood straight-backed and in the uniform everyone seemed to wear. Long dress-like bottom,\[ I think this was mentioned several times in the previous chapter... not sure if it’s worth mentioning twice\] billowing top with a deep cut collar and over sized sleeves, tied at the waist with a belt secured behind the back.

“May I come in?”  The dark, earthy hall behind her stood in stark contrast to those glowing diamond-blue eyes.

Billy shrugged, stepping aside for her. “Don’t think I can really stop you.” 

“You could simply say ‘no’,” Allia let out a terse sigh. “But that wouldn’t be very much like you.” 

Allia stepped through the doorway and the faint glow faded from her eyes.
