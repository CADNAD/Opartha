The shadow of the northern wall of The Citadel eclipsed the entire northern side, covering the fervent, waiting people in darkness. The bright overcast of the afternoon darkened noticeably, as once again the sun  disappeared beyond large mountainous range that guarded Nairfalk from the Leviathi Strait, and all the dangers that prowled beyond it.

Okin shivered, even inching closer to the minute fire of a bright torch held by a passing Rothar. He swept aside his usually light brown hair, which was now dark chocolate even in the light of the torch as it was completely drenched.

The line finally moved forward as a shabbily dressed man exited, looking at the sky as he passed the Rothar and Istar who stood by the entrance.

*Only a matter of time now,* Okin thought as a man three heads in front of him entered the church. *The enlightening Truths you’ll receive will be worth the hours spent waiting a dozens of times over.*

The Ather closed his eyes again, thinking over the recent events he would speak about soon. He had broken his perfect record, the thing that was most important to him, or so he thought. But unexpectedly, his Rothar, Gendro, had offered a sound proposition: Okin did not withhold information with the *intent* of breaking the tenant of Truth: surely that mattered, didn’t it?  

And the other---well, they weren’t really even lies---Okin had told Previa since he had arrived in The Citadel were almost necessary lest he put both their careers in danger. Yes, Gendro was right there. There were times when one could literally not lie in some way. It was telling that Okin had a flawless record of Truth, and until this brutal, impossible situation had come along, and now his record had been broken.

And what of the other values he was trying to protect, the other values which he had not proven his Dedication to as much as Truth, like Justice and Bravery.

*Surely I mustn’t tell the Arbiter about that, as his only concern is the Truth. But... it is the* Truth, *isn’t it? And that is all that matters to the man. So... I must tell him?*

Okin scratched his head. Once again, the Truth was almost shrouded, like it had been with his decision regarding Billy’s trial, or telling Previa about his father’s intentions. Both options seemed right--- yet also both wrong.

*No matter. I will just go in and tell the Truth, and listen to what he has to say.*

The Ather straightened out his damp robes and combed back his hair as another man came out from within the church. The Istar guarding the door motioned for Okin to come forward.

“Hello, High Ather,” she said. “I apologize for the long wait.”

“Oh, it is insignificant. I would gladly wait again to see such an inspiring man.”

“Well, I believe the Arbiter will be happy to see you too,” the Istar smiled. “He should be waiting just for you just behind the altar.”

Okin smiled back as he walked through the large arch into the church. He passed the dozens of rows of dark wooden pews, approaching the back of the large, brightly painted building. 

Standing above him, past the altar, his God held out both arms to greet him, the Light surrounding his kind, loving face. The beautiful tessellated glass that depicted Aredal\[ 2021-06-29, 6:19 PM

Maybe opportunity for minor God?\] could even be seen on this dull evening, barely lit up by the four tall candles at each corner of the altar.

Another kind face greeted Okin as the Ather stepped up to the altar, a wholesome smile underneath crow’s feet. Above his tender eyes sat an almost threatening tattoo. Etched directly on his forehead was the same tattoo on Okin’s palm, except all three triangles were present, completing the full image of the four-point star in the centre of the three triangles pointing outwards. However, like Okin’s, the triangle at the top of the star was golden, unlike the other two, which were black. Unlike Okin’s, the centre star was also golden.

The man stretched out a spotted, wrinkly hand from underneath his pure white tunic. 

The Arbiter of Truth, the man who had initiated Okin’s Dedication.

Okin took a deep bow before shaking the man’s hand.  

“Arbiter Dabria. It is an honour to see you again.”

“O-Okin?” The Arbiter leaned closer to inspect the Ather’s face.

Okin nodded, smiling. “You remember me!”  he almost shouted.

“Well of course I do, Okin. It is not often that an Arbiter has such an easy decision when deciding if one is ready to move forward in their Dedication.”

Okin’s cheeks peeked up into a wide smile.

“Ah, I wish I had come back for such an exciting occasion, but unfortunately this is much more... dire,” Okin said.

The Arbiter frowned, raising an eyebrow.  

“What is it, Okin? W-well here, come take a seat, and we will discuss it.”

The Arbiter motioned to two cushioned chairs at the very back of the church, dimly lit by a candle in the corner. 

Okin took a seat, eye-level with the Arbiter, who was short of stature but had a strangely tall seated posture.

“So what seems to be the problem, my friend?”

“I---,” Okin glanced up at the man’s soft, gentle eyes, then quickly back down at the ground.

“I lied. Twice.”

“Why is that, my son?” The tightness in Okin’s chest relaxed a bit---the Arbiter’s voice was curious but gentle, not angry.

“I--- I thought that Justice wouldn’t be met if I didn’t withhold some information. I wanted to show that I was ready to move forward in the next level of my Dedication, to bring out Aredal’s Justice myself.”

The Arbiter nodded, but his expression was understanding and thoughtful, not judgemental.

“And that required you to lie?” 

Okin scratched the back of his head.

“To be sure that I would see Justice done, yes.”

Okin glanced back up to the Arbiter, who still maintained a welcoming smile.

“So Justice has been done, yes?”

Okin’s neck craned back down towards his chest.

“No.”

The crushing reply was more revealing and far more devastating to Okin than it was to the Arbiter. It was painfully obvious to him now that he had sacrificed his perfect record for nothing. 

“You were beyond excellent, Okin.”

The Arbiter leaned forward, lifting up Okin’s chin with a shaky hand so the Ather met his eyes.

“And you still are. You are trying to move too quickly, and crying when you are not perfect, which none of us can be. The path of Dedication is a lifelong journey. You don’t need to finish it now,” he said. “The man who runs without even looking where he is going is sure to stumble. But more importantly, the men who stumble and get back up have effectively never stumbled at all.”

The Arbiter let down his gentle hand off of Okin’s face, and the Ather blinked rapidly at the old man. *So he is saying, I just need to slow down? But how can I slow* now, *faced with all these new revelations and the eternal mysteries which lay beyond them?* 

“But sometimes... I feel as if my journey before was clear. Now I don’t know when I am lying, or the Truth eludes me. Sometimes I feel... like I am forced to lie, that sometimes we are all forced to lie.”

“I almost forgot what it was like, struggles like those. Now when I speak the Truth, everybody sees it as such. But I remember when I was much like you, and I would speak the same Truth, but the faces would look much different,” the old man chuckled. “But I would still say it, when many wanted me not to. It must be done; the Truth must always be brought forward, no matter who stands against it, or even if nothing is done about it. The Truth must be said simply because it is the Truth. It is...well it is being Brave, too. Yes yes. The values of Aredal really do all work in harmony,” a warm smile stretched across Dabria’s face.

“Yes, yes,” Okin’s eyes fell to the ground. Dabria was right---the Truth must be spoken. But these were heavy words, and it was a struggle to lift them. Out of Okin’s throat. But he had already betrayed the Truth twice. He would not do so again.

He peered up at Dabria’s kind, amber eyes.

“There is a Truth I must tell you.”

Dabria inched closer to Okin and placed a hand on his shoulder.

“Go on.”

A deep sigh left Okin’s lips. It was the right thing to do.

“I believe that Impalias Aldwin may be hiding crucial information... about a former childhood friend of mine and the death of his father. And even more importantly...about the very fabric that makes up the beliefs of Versalism.” 

This got a rise out of Dabria. 

“Impalias Aldwin?” He asked. “How could he be hiding something about the very fabric that makes up the beliefs of Versalism?”

Okin shook his head with empty eyes. “That, I do not know. And---there’s nothing definite... but there are reasons for my suspicions. Still...I do not know how to... *confirm* their accuracy without betraying the trust of my mentor.”

“Well, I do not believe that Aldwin would purposefully hide something of such importance and closeness from you. But---even the best of us can get caught up in the temptation of hiding ourselves in the shadows. Sometimes we need someone else to help bring us back into the Light,” Dabria smiled. 

“Perhaps what you need to do is ask Aldwin yourself about what you believe. It may be uncomfortable, but you must be upfront, and truthful about your intentions. Only then can you get the confirmation you need.”

Okin’s heard the man, but his eyes were focused on the raspberry candles that lined the sides of the church. He didn’t know how he could bring up something so crazy to Aldwin; how would he even ask a question like that? And Aldwin had already denied Okin’s inquiries about Billy.

Still, Dabria gave solid advice, as per usual. There was really nothing else to say. 

“I cannot express my thanks enough, Arbiter Dabria,” Okin bowed his head.

Dabria laughed and patted the Ather on the back. “It is always good to see you, Okin. I’m sorry you had to wait out in the rain.”

Okin got up from the chair, shaking Dabria’s hand before the old man even left his seat.

“Thank you again, Arbiter Dabria.”

Okin turned and strolled down the main hall of the church. He looked back over his shoulder after he had gotten about halfway down the row of pews. 

A little needle pricked him from within as a smiling Dabria waved goodbye. Okin stopped in his tracks. For a second he considered telling the Arbiter the detailed context of everything, from Billy’s trial, to his suspicions about the Citadel withholding Versalist texts, to his forced white lie to Previa, to his meeting with the strange vagrant and the purported Fourth Book of Nexon. 

But no, they were all unique problems of immense complexity. And what could Dabria shed light on regarding Billy, or this supposed conspiracy?

Okin shivered at the image of the kind old man’s friendly wave. What *would* happen if he confronted Aldwin with his suspicions? If Aldwin was innocent, the fact that Okin would even believe for a second something so damning would change their relationship forever. And if Aldwin *was* hiding something, could Okin even bare to know what kind of secret his long-time mentor, a man he saw as a second father to him hid in the shadows? 

Perhaps... perhaps the Arbiter of Truth had given the Okin of the past the perfect advice; an Okin who commonly dealt with the innocent, merry folk of small towns like Ariska. But these two accusations from Billy and the vagrant... this was *different.* A little part of him whispered that maybe being upfront wouldn’t uncover the Truth here.

But as he froze upon the still-smiling Dabria, Okin realized maybe it wasn’t worth it to continue this cycle of destruction to uncover the Truth about these accusations. He felt an aftershock, a reminder of that pang of guilt from manipulating Previa. 

No, lies and trickery weren’t worth it, even to uncover a Truth so mysterious. If he was going to do this--- if he was going to uncover this mysterious Truth, he would not sacrifice his own Truth in the process. 

The Ather waved back at the white-robed man before exiting the church.
