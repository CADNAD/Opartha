Light Heralds can absorb light in their bodies, which is stored and transported in a separate functional system called the *Vivranioscan System,* which works much like the cardiovascular system, transporting Visible Light to the Astacassia through *tenars*, and Pure Light from the Astacassia to the rest of the body through *couls.* The Vivranioscan System takes Light absorbed through the skin to the Astacassia, which produces Zeltics through the processing of visible light energy. The Astacassia can then use Zeltics to process visible light stored in the Vivranioscan System into *Pure Light*, which resembles an astoundingly bright white light. 

Pure Light can then be transformed into any of the six types of known Heraldic Lights, through small organs that rest at the *coul ends*.
