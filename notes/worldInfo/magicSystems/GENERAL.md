All Heralds naturally accumulate a power source/hormone called *Zeltics* (unknown to any in Opartha currently), through different forms in their Astaccasia, a unique part of the brain which changes the other lobes and central nervous system. The method in which Zeltics are produced is different per each of the five known Heraldic Mutations, as each Heraldic Mutation has a slightly different Astaccasia.

Every Herald also has a different Zeltic Capacity, and the Zeltic cost of each action may differ per Herald.
