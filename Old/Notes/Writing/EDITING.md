General:

\-Rid yourself of passive verbs (e.g.: was, were)

\-Contrast between Time Slowed action scenes (slower pacing) and regular action scenes (quick pacing)

\-Change holy adjectives (e.g.: Dark, Light, Truth, Justice) that are used in sentences not referring to the actual holy concept to be capitalized in Okin’s and holy men’s chapters, but not in Billy’s or Liu’s. (Except of course when referring to Heraldry or during a Versalist character’s dialogue.)



Logan’s stuff:

\-Often, settings are described in a shot scene, and then zoomed in, without any additional description. This becomes a bit formulaic and boring, and often details and additional imagery are sacrificed.

\-Sometimes the limited context is a bit over the top and leaves people confused. This is the hardest WIP and will require more beta reads, especially longer period ones.

\-Remind the audience of appearances/features by re-describing them in unique ways when actions are taken.

\-Benjamin’s dialect is too confusing in the earlier chapters. Make sure to never eliminate subject, instead eliminate rather useless words like ‘and’ and shorten other common words.

\-Make the dialogue more characteristic 

\-Rearrange scene so Billy and Kiatus’ conversation is after the other scene

\-Make action scene prose faster pacing wise

\-Add \[Magic Material Name\] handcuffs or injections to the scenes where they are in jail



Marco’s stuff:

\-The outfit/appearance description is good, but often too much when we first meet characters, especially for recurring ones. If we wish to describe that much about appearances, revealing as the characters do actions is much better for micro-pacing.

\-Remind the audience of appearances/features by re-describing them in unique ways when actions are taken.

\-Always use dialogue tags for scenes with 3+ speaking characters.

\-Use ‘seemed to’ less.

Unity:

\-Remind the audience of appearances/features by re-describing them in unique ways when actions are taken.

\-Marco needs to condense, Logan needs to give more detail
