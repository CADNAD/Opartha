Liu walked across the field with the dark-robed man who had assisted Khan in the last game. Approaching the second circular mini-fortress, he saw it was identical to the one he stood atop when watching the last match.

The Dark Herald walked around to the back where the only entrance was, an holed archway. 

Upon entering, the Dark Herald summoned a parrot the darkness, and held out his hand for the parrot to perch on. 

“Fly to fortress A,” the man commanded the bird. “Once inside, announce ‘Begin!’, and then go back into the darkness.”

“Yes master,” the parrot squaked, and then flew out of the building.

Liu paid no attention to the dark-robed man, instead trying to recall all the names of the units Peng and Iri had spoken of.

Moles, yes, I know what they do. Parrots, yes. The defensive units were called the Domesnappers, who were countered by the Drophawks, but the Drophawks couldn’t win the game because only ground units can win the game. And there were the Shield and Spear-Men, who were also beat by the Drophawks, until it was defeated by the Sniper Snake. And then the Sniper Snake was beat by the Bullhog. And Peng also mentioned... Leechcrows and Ravhounds.

Liu rubbed his chin, scanning the Dark Herald while replaying each unit’s abilities in his head. 

“Are there any other units beside Moles, Parrots, Domesnappers, Drophawks, Sniper Snakes, Bullhogs, Leechcrows, and Ravhounds?” Liu asked.

The man thought about Liu’s list, and then replied, “Yes, there are the Builders, the Shadowmakers, and the Frogs,” the dark-robed man replied. 

“What do those three units do?” Liu asked.

“Builders can take the wood and create makeshift cover, which works well with ranged units like Snakes and Frogs. Speaking of Frogs, they can jump quite high and attack with venom from a medium range, making them quite good for flanking units. The Shadowmaker stops any unit decay, and also heals units who take damage.”

“Unit decay?” 

“All summons slowly decay in the light. The brighter the day, the faster the decay is. Since today is very cloudy, Shadowmakers probably won’t be quite as good.”

So at least I know all the units now. But I don’t know the costs, or any of the strategy.

Interrupting his train of thought, the Dark Herald shot his attention back at Liu. 

“The game has begun.”

The dark-robed man waved both hands in the air, summoning one mole, who stood patiently at his feet.

“Gold or silver?” The man asked Liu.

“Gold. Put all moles on gold,” Liu replied.

The Dark Herald held out a gold coin behind his back, and the mole sniffed eagerly, before diving into the patch of dirt.

“Okay, so what can I buy with gold?” Liu asked as he waited for the mole to come up.

“A gold coin gives you five to spend, and a silver gives you one. Spear-Men cost one, Moles, Leechcrows and Shield-Men cost two, Domesnappers, Frogs, Parrots, Shadowmakers cost three, Drophawks and Ravhounds cost four, the Sniper Snake cost five, and a Bullhog costs eight.”

*That is a lot to choose from, especially since I don’t know what many of them can do. At least I know I won’t be buying the Bullhog right away, and the Snake seemed vulnerable on its own. And he basically said I won’t be needing Shadowmakers today.*

“What do the Leechcrows and the Ravhounds do?” Liu asked.

“Leechcrows are three small birds that can only attack other aerial units. Ravhounds are the fastest troop in the game, and can be recalled to base for further instructions, without the use of a Parrot,” the man replied quickly.

Khan mentioned a ‘Ravhound rush.’ I should ask what that is.

“What’s a Ravhound rush?” Liu asked.

“Some players send out an early Ravhound. If you don’t have a tough defensive unit, then you’ll lose the game.”

Ah, so that’s why Hao bought a Domesnapper first, because he was afraid of that threat. But Khan knew he would do that, so he bought two moles. So it seems like Ravhound and double-Mole are both gambles, and Domesnapper-Mole is the safe option.

Just as Liu was considering his opening options, the mole popped up with a gold coin in its mouth, placing it at the feet of the Dark Herald, before going digging again.

“You now have five credits to spend,” the man told Liu.

I don’t know the game, and I don’t know my opponent. Better play it safe.

“I’ll buy a Domesnapper and a Mole,” Liu said. 

The Dark Herald nodded, and twirled his fingers in the air, forming the familiar shape of the Domesnapper.  Fitting to its name, the creature’s shell was a perfect dome, a foot and a half tall at it’s apex. Liu could see that its jaw was covered with rough spikes. The Domesnapper stood as still as a statue.

“You must give the Domesnapper an initial command. They respond to their unit names,” the man said to Liu as he began to summon the second mole.

“What commands can I give it though?” Liu asked.

“All the units can see and understand where the chalk begins and ends. You can tell them to defend within the chalk, or defend in front of the chalk, or attack the enemy’s troops, or rush the enemy’s chalkline,” the dark-robed man replied rapidly.

“Defend within the chalk, Domesnapper,” Liu commanded, and the Domesnapper began its steady dodder out of the fort. 

Before the Domesnapper had even waddled out of the building, the man had already summoned a second mole, who began digging.

“What if he sends a Ravhound now?” Liu asked.

“Don’t worry, as soon as the Domesnapper is within the chalk, it counts as a guarding ground unit.”

The feeling of blindness strangely sparked an excitement in Liu. But, he could still maintain that rush and add the rush of victory if he bought a parrot next.

I need a parrot, I have no idea what my opponent is doing. Well, he is also a novice player, and has never played against me, so he’s probably trying to play it safe as well.

Soon enough, a mole popped up from a new hole, carrying a golden coin in its mouth. Liu couldn’t tell whether this was the first or second mole, they appeared to be identical. 

“Five more cred-“

“I’ll buy a parrot,” Liu said.

“Okay, you have two credits remaining.”

The man waved his hands in the air, and the parrot came to life.

“Scan the battlefield, and record all units, both ours and the enemy’s. Then return to fortress B,” Liu told the parrot, looking to the dark-robed man for any signs that his command was invalid. Unfortunately, he gave no tells.

“Yes master,” the parrot squaked, before flying out of the fort.

Liu watched the parrot fly out of the back entrance, a bit uneasy. 

“How do I know if the parrot understood the words I’m saying?” 

“The parrot will tell you if it does not understand something you’re saying. But just because it thinks it understands, doesn’t mean it will always get it right,” the man responded.

Liu nodded. I wonder how intelligent they really are? The Dark Heralds must have taught them all the basic words, locations and questions that could come up in this game, but how far did they go?  The only way to find out is to experiment. I wonder how the battlefield is looking right now... 

Liu imagined his Domesnapper sitting just behind the chalk, crushing any Ravhounds or Spear-Men who were sent out. But a more dastardly possibility occurred to him: what if his opponent had bought a Drophawk as one of his first two buys? They had seen how much success Khan had just a round earlier--- although even he did admit it was a read on Hao’s repeated style of safe play, and was still a gamble. It was more likely that his opponent had the same idea that he did- make the safe play. Even if his opponent tried to copy Khan’s strategy, at least Liu had bought parrot earlier, so he would have more time to put up a good defence. He still had an extra two credits, and was quite sure a mole would come up with a gold coin soon.

Sure enough, one did. The furry creature scurried up to the Dark Herald, dropping another coin at his feet.

“Seven credits now.”

Liu was unsure of what to buy at this point. Perhaps waiting for the parrot’s info would be the wisest option. Estimating how fast the parrot flew, and how it seemed to go to and from Hao’s fort quite quickly, Liu knew it would be back soon enough.

And sure enough, it was. Liu held out his arm, and the parrot hovered before landing on top of it. 

“On the battlefield, you have one Domesnapper. Your opponent has one Domesnapper, and one Frog,” the parrot squaked.

“Where are they on the battlefield?”

The parrot cocked its head sideways, and stayed still for several seconds. Perhaps Liu’s question was too complex, or too abstract.

“Both the Domesnapper and the Frog are within the opponent’s chalk,” the parrot finally spoke.

Impressive. So Liu was right: his opponent was playing quite defensively. Then the best option is to take the center. 

But with what? He remembered Hao had tried to take the center with Shield and Spear-Men, but they were crushed by a hawk attack. Still, his opponent didn’t have a parrot, and would have a tough time predicting Liu’s moves. 

But there’s still a better option. The frog is medium range, he remembered the dark-robed man saying. Now if any of the troops were long-ranged, it would be the Sniper Snake, without a doubt. That would merely outrange and snipe the frog, and if his opponent bought a Drophawk--- Liu remembered how easily the Sniper Snake had hit the Drophawk out of the air during Khan and Hao’s match. 

The only thing Liu had to worry about was his opponent buying a Bullhog and trying to rush him--- his opponent had bought two three-cost troops in a Domesnapper and a Frog, which meant it was very likely he had also bought two moles, trying to beat Liu by defending and gaining an economy advantage. 

But, even buying a Sniper Snake, Liu still had two credits remaining, which he could buy a Shield-Man with. The Bullhog seemed to take a lot of damage from the Sniper Snake, and there was no way it could beat it with two tanks in front of it. 

Liu blinked out of his long train of thought, his eyes meeting the Dark Herald’s intently.

“Shield-Man, Sniper Snake.”

The man gave a short nod, and the mists formed to create a grey man holding a shield, and a yellow rattlesnake. They stood next to each other, both roughly two feet tall, although the majority of the snake’s body stayed on the ground. 

“Advance towards the center of the battlefield. Sniper Snake, stay behind Spear-Man,” Liu commanded. The Spear-Man began marching out of the tent, the serpent slithering behind it.

Liu turned to the parrot. 

“Parrot, follow the friendly Sniper Snake and alert it to retreat back to our chalk if the Spear-Man is destroyed.  If it is, return here,” Liu said.

“Yes, master,” the parrot squaked, before hovering in the air, following the caravan of two.

Shortly after the three units had left the fort, a mole came up with another gold coin in its mouth. After handing it to the dark-robed man, the mole stood still at its feet. Then, the second mole returned to the surface, but bore no coin.

“Why did they stop? Why does he have no coin?” Liu asked the Dark Herald.

“The moles do not smell any more gold. You can either switch them to silver, or advance to another dig site, which are marked by the tents,” the man replied.

This is a bad spot. The parrot will only return if the Shield-Man is destroyed, and who knows when that will be. Liu knew that mining for silver coins put him at a mathematical disadvantage, as silvers were only worth 1/5 of golds, but it was very risky to move out of the tent, as the game could be instantly ended if any of the opponent’s troops attacked him.

Still, based on the units he had purchased, it was unlikely that Jin had purchased troops that could successfully attack Liu, and instead was focusing on moving himself to the next tent to out-economy Liu. If that was the case, then Liu would only guarantee his loss by restricting himself to silvers. Plus, Liu had already sent out two attacking units to take the center.

I have to go for it. 

“Summon me a Ravhound,” Liu said. It will leave me with one coin for later.

The Dark Herald nodded, and a fit, black hound generated in front of Liu. It stood two feet tall on all fours, around a foot under the height of the Spear-Men, but absolutely massive in comparison if you were equating Spear-Men to humans and Ravhounds to wolves or dogs.

“We are leaving this base. Ravhound, Coinmoles, follow me, and stay in front of my path,” Liu commanded.

The Dark Herald touched his temple with his right hand while waving his left towards the moles. They both began to trail Liu behind the Ravhound.

With his summons and Herald behind him, Liu stepped out into the battlefield.
