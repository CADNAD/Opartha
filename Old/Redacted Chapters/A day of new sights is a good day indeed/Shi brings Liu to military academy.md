For the first couple hours of the ride, Liu nervously clutched the reins, pushing his legs tightly around the horses’ body. Even after giving Shi the pouch of gold, he still felt unstable, like his shoes were going to fall off, or worse, he was going to fall. They weren’t going any faster than a normal gallop, but part of him wanted to ask Shi to slow down. He didn’t.

But after the first few rest stops, where the soldiers fed their horses and gave Liu some produce to feed his, he felt more comfortable around the mare. At least he wasn’t repelled by it, like before. 

“How much longer is it to the academy?” Liu asked Shi while the rest of the soldiers tended to their horses.

“We’re almost there. It’s in Kazon-Tsuh, if you’ve ever been there,” Shi answered.

“This is probably the farthest North I’ve ever been, actually,” Liu replied. 

Shi smiled as he pulled himself onto horseback. “Well, I always say, a day of new sights is a good day indeed.”

Liu pulled himself onto his horse and continued to follow the caravan northwards.

The city of Kazon-Tsuh was unlike any Liu had ever seen, an amalgamation of Delmian and Imperial culture. The stone brick streets and minimalistic wooden buildings were obviously Delmian handiwork, but the elegant carriages, the clean, stylistic tunics, and the golden street decor was very much Imperial. Built on Delmian land, but improved and optimized by the Empire. Liu felt right at home.

Shi’s caravan trotted towards the centre of the city, Liu awkwardly stopping, then accelerating as merchants, townspeople and street urchins bustled in front of the horses. Most looked ethnically Delmian, they had probably come to a big city like Kazon-Tsuh to sell farm goods and handiwork, or to establish new contracts or permits. Liu saw Imperial guards with patrolling the city streets, securing the area so the Delmians could stay busy and content. 

He watched the guards turned rigidly standing straight with their muskets at their side, giving their undivided attention to a tall man in a red tunic with golden accenting, his arms behind his back. The guards saluted him.

“Maybe that’s what you’ll be doing someday,” Shi spoke loudly over the hustle of the city.

Liu watched as the man commanded the guards. “Does a captain of the city guard really need that much education? It seems like a pretty simplistic job.”

“Their job may seem mundane during peacetime, but if the city was ever attacked, even low-level officers need to be well educated on tactics,” Shi said.

“Fair,” Liu replied.  “Although I hope the ends to my education will be something more interesting.”

Shi smiled. “I’m sure it will be,” he said as the two men continued their trot. “But I recommend you keep your opinions to yourself, for now at least. After all, you will be interacting with many of these officers with such mundane jobs, now that we’re here,” Shi said jokingly, and Liu looked around confusedly at the surrounding buildings for any indication of which could be the academy. 

“We’re not quite at the actual academy yet. It’s just up there, at the far western end of the city,” Shi motioned forward to the end of the road.

As they moved through the sea of heads, the building in question became more clear, and the fact that it was an Imperial academy became ever more glaring; The circular mahogany pillars with golden tops and the bright red scoped roofs, the pillars marked Golden Beisanian characters reading downwards, the building was shouting that it was property of the Tzen Empire. The caravan’s horses stopped just in front of the entrance, and Shi’s guards hitched their horses to the few posts on the side of the road, Liu following suit. Shi pulled Iago’s bag of coins from the horses’ saddle, and also slung a second satchel around his shoulder. Commanding his guards to stay in place, he motioned for Liu to come with him inside the building.
