It was only now, cuffed and being escorted to his death, that Billy realized the true terror of his surroundings. Perhaps it was in part due to his brain looking for how he could possibly get out of this situation, and inevitably realizing there was nowhere to run. Nowhere that wouldn’t end in a smashed skull, that is. 

Their footsteps echoed through the rugged cavern walls, along with those of two men jogging ahead. He had no idea where the endless tunnels would lead, though, which felt more like the halls were a straight path to his doom. 

At least this mountain was mostly covered as opposed to his residential one, taking away that fear of falling. That is, if he could even see three feet in any direction. With the faraway footsteps ahead, the light drained and disappeared, leaving a small bit so they could see just ahead of their march. Allia still slouched, chains in front of her arms and hair covering her face. She must’ve been why they were keeping it dark. \[Maybe remove this line, it is telling.\]

In the constant darkness, the guards at their side were unrecognizable, but there were several sets of heavy footsteps. Even if he could somehow coordinate an escape plan with Allia, versus several trained men that were guaranteed to be Heralds, resistance was futile.

It really did seem that his fate was in the hands of the Monastery, just as it had been before in the hands in the Athers. And both authorities would sentence him to death without considering his perspective. He cried a little inside; he hadn’t ever asked for much, he had never fought for anything besides the survival of himself and his brother, but in the eyes of the masters, that was still an unreasonable request.

And so, forcing himself to accept the way things were, he trudged silently in the darkness towards the denial of his plea for life.

A guttural grunt came out from one of the guards to his left. There was a *whooshing* sound, like a door being closed in an air tunnel, except much quieter, and a moderate whisper.

“Cut.”

Billy felt something against his leg, and he stopped walking, turning around, trying to get a glimpse of what it was in the darkness. His arms, strung together in front of his belly, were tugged downwards. The rope ripped free.

There was a vile screech from the end of the hall where the light peeked through, followed by a blunt bang. 

“Stay here!” The surrounding guards shouted, clanking off towards the light at the end of the tunnel. In the commotion, Billy wriggled the cut rope off his arms. He was free.

“What---“ Allia’s voice whispered next to him. The guards charged forward, closer to the light, where the tunnel curved.  Billy sneaked backward. How far could run in the endless darkness behind them?

“Stay back,” one of the guards said as their forms kissed the light. Billy could make out four silhouettes, armoured and each armed with different weapons. “It’s a Transportation Herald, I heard the sound of a \[name for frisbee thing\].”

The other guards did as commanded, crouching back towards Billy, still facing the flickering light.

“Wait a second,” one of the guards whispered forcefully. “There was five of us. Where is---“

A sharp slice cut through the air, and a thin disc came barreling in a curve parallel to the shape of a tunnel.

The first guard didn’t turn fast enough, and fell to the floor from the smack in the chest. The disc ricochet bounced off the wall and returned to its sender, still hidden in the further section of the cavern.

“Attackers!”  The commanding guard raised his hands into fists and the shadows of several small daggers hovered above his own on the light at the end of the tunnel. “Stand ready!” 

Something else moved in front of him, shielding his vision from the forms of the guards.

“No,” a deep voice said. “Stand down.”

Billy stepped aside, and the head of a fifth shadow came into the dim light at the back of the tunnel. The guards scrambled around to face the newcomer, uncomfortably mushing together as to maintain an eye on the attacker ahead.

Then, from within the hands of the fifth form, a bright light glowed, igniting the surroundings. The man---who was in fact one of the guards, as he was armoured from head to toe---held a shimmering Light Crystal in his palms, revealing the terrified, sweaty faces of his fellow guardsmen.

“Wh-what,” the commanding guard, still keeping an eye the other side of the cave, turned his head in shock.

“Catch,” the intruding guard said to Allia, whose hands had also been untied. He threw the Crystal, and she caught it in both hands, her platinum eyes finally visible, sucking the glow away from the crystal and into themselves.

“What are you--- take them down!” The commanding guard shouted, still keeping his daggers pointing toward the opposite end of the tunnel. 

The two remaining guards charged forward, one wielding a short sword and one with a long spear. 

The man with a short sword dashed faster than Billy’s eyes could keep track, zipping around the fifth man at Allia and Billy, but not before the mysterious fifth guard could u	tter a command.

“Rush!” 

From within the shadows, two black hounds leaped, tackling the man to the ground. The redirection of his immense momentum rag dolled him across the stone floor, causing even Billy to cringe. 

The second attacker, seeing his companion crash against the ground, ended his charge. Then, suddenly, he jerked a hand to the side of the mountain’s walls, and the rock began to rumble.

The commanding officer did a brief shoulder check, his eyes wide with a mix of rage and terror. He still held shaky hands towards the end of the tunnel where the disc had come from, anticipating with the hovering daggers right at the curve of the tunnel.

The air whipped again--- but the blur stopped in midair. Two daggers had been stuck in the wall by the commanding officer, anticipating an ambush, and he had also anticipated the projectile. The iron disc stopped in midair, shaking under control of the guard’s Heraldry. A weak, nasally laugh of relieved pride escaped his lips.

Not sparing a second, a large man jumped out from the hidden turn of the tunnel, and thrust open palms out at the giggling guard, who was thrown backwards, disc and daggers flying outwards.

The mysterious fifth guard dodged out of the way of the airborne commander, who slid across the ground into the darkness, his armour clanging as he flipped over himself. 

Terrified to see his commander hurled through the air, the second attacker stopped the rumbling. He was met in the face by the end of a long staff from the fifth ‘guard’.

“Idiot boy! Do you want this mountain to fall and crush us all?” The man shouted.

The guard relented, falling on his knees. Allia stepped forward, glowing crystal still in one hand, though much dimmer, and Billy could see the look of shame on the fallen man’s face. He slumped to the ground, and his officer groaned at the end of the tunnel, Allia keeping a primed hand pointed at both.

“Go! We must run!” Billy stepped further into the light, trying to get a good angle of the faux guard’s face, which was covered by a steel helmet, like the others.

Those slight wrinkles and square, greying beard--- it was the man who they had seen first upon arriving in the island, Damian’s master, Avador. Why was he helping them?

Billy turned to face the other surprise attacker who had helped them take down the guards. Towering over the others, his pearly, bright smile contrasting against his noir skin, Benjy was unmistakable.

“Benjamin---you---you came to rescue me!” Billy shouted. He almost wanted to give his massive friend a hug. 

“Not only you,” Benjamin said, nodding his chin to Allia, who had started to regain her posture. “And not only me.”

Damian stepped out from the behind the turn, a small bunny with purple smoke coalescing its edges at his side.

“Damian!” Billy shouted, running forward and wrapping an arm around his brother. “Why---this was a big risk! You---“

“We’re brothers, Billy,” Damian said. 

“I told you, even the most innocent of Summons can be quite useful, kid.” Avador smiled. “But come, the time for discussion is later. We have to go!”
