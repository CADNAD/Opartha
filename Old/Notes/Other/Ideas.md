\-Previa tells Okin that often times he hears his father talking upstairs to someone despite not hearing anyone enter the house (hint that Revictus is a space Herald)

\-Okin then tries to steal the space crystal (Backuhâ€™s idea) and fights Aldwin in his own house, escaping with it

\-Okin and Backuh trap Revictus in the Shadow Realm, and Backuh kills him
