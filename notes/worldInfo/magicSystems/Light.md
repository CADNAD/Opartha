# Light  (The Heraldry of Energy)

Absorb visible light, and covert it to other forms of energy. The conversations are harder and harder as they move away from EM energy.

STAYING WITHIN ELECTROMAGNETIC IS EASIEST:

1. light to other UV, xrays, or Infrared (gives them all types of vision assist)
2. light to radar, fm, tv, short wave, am (can be used to detect things and send messages with technology. right now pretty useless.)
3. gamma rays (can poison a person. Takes around 1 minute of light absorption to hit poison someone immediately @ contact distance)

EASY CONVERSIONS, in order of ease

1. light to heat (heat wave, self-feeding (caloric))
2. light to sound (sound wave, blow out people's eardrums)
3. light to kinetic (shock wave, blow people back)
4. light to "electricity" (combination of the three above; electric wave)

HARD CONVERSIONS, in order of ease

1. light to potential (hit harder)
2. light to gravitational (gravity well)

----

Energy emitted is in wave form, and follows inverse square law

Light has two modes, *conduction* and *radial* that are toggled between

​	Conduction is more efficient, the energy will try to find a path to the ground. Energy is released from the user at all points touching 	the ground

​	Radial is less efficient. Energy is released at all points along a person. Energy used in the radiation is equally distributed at all 	points
