“Get up! You’re all supposed to be out of bed already! Get up!”

The captain’s thundering voice blared into the room, and the Okin heard the repeated racket of feet planting on the floor.

Okin threw the thin sheet off of himself, snapping up into a straight-backed seated position, and he stood up and gave a hearty salute before his vision was even clear enough to see Devinar Maklo’s stern face.

“Sparring is supposed to begin at five, on the dot!” The captain shouted. “It’s one minute to right now, if we don’t get down to the practice rooms on time, you’ll all be missing breakfast!”

Dubli, the only one still in bed, was yanked up by his twin brother. The spindly twins both scrambled into a salute shortly aftter.

The captain sighed, and the squad, all dressed in grey undergarments, marched out of the dorms.

A hand tapped Okin from behind. The Ather turned to see that Gendro had squeezed himself next to him. 

“Okin! I know that Maklo announced to the squad that we have other duties and wouldn’t be attending all the training, but you’ve been gone for almost the entire time we’ve been here! The other trainees are starting to grow suspicious,” Gendro whispered as they marched down the stone steps.

“I need to do this right now. I need every second I can get out there, and I still don’t have nearly enough information, or time,” Okin replied.

“Aren’t you supposed to be taking me out too?” Gendro asked. “I’m still sorry about the--- the incident with Billy’s weapon. And I know you said that I wouldn’t understand, but I don’t need to understand. I just--- I want to know. I just want know, what are you doing out there?”

Okin squinted at the Rothar. He was still curious about what Okin was doing? Yes, the man had saved his life, but before that, all Gendro did was snooze and quip! And yes, his recent behaviour had been back to, well, disappointing.

The Rothar’s wide eyes didn’t leave Okin’s face as they continued to march down into the training hall. He looked like he really wanted an answer.

“Remember, I told you, I’m always willing to help you out. It’s literally my duty,” Gendro said.

What was this strange sudden interest in Okin’s affairs? Before this, Gendro acted like the *last* thing he wanted to do was, well, his job. Did the Rothar want to finally take part in the proper bond between an Ather and his Rothar? Could Okin confide in the man with all the chaos that had teared through his life recently?

No, Okin couldn’t tell him. Gendro may be a *little* smarter than Previa, but he was all the more apathetic, and loose-lipped, and Gendro’s breakdown just a few days before assured Okin that the man was not stable or mature enough to handle the darkness. Sure, the Rothar had done his duty *one* time, in the heat of the moment, when Okin cried for help. But that was an easy job for a man like Gendro, able to wield the powers of Light Heraldry, the same as Aredal himself. Plus; this was something Okin had to do alone, it was his duty, it was his opportunity to prove *his* Dedication. 

“Well?” Gendro raised an eyebrow.

“I am helping Trenton with his election campaign,” Okin looked away from his Rothar. “As you know, the date is nearing, and he needs support now more than ever.”

Gendro nodded, seemingly satisfied with the response. *And he should be*, Okin thought; it was the Truth, just very generalized.

Okin’s mind instinctively went back to scripture, specifically the one that chastised exactly that---leaving out information--- as lying. But this was different, wasn’t it? He wasn’t lying for himself, it was to protect others from the darkness he was facing. It was--- for something greater.

Entering the open training space, the squad spread out into a long line, all facing Captain Maklo. 

The Devinar pulled open a pocket watch. 

“Well, it’s five-oh-one, so it looks like we’re skipping breakfast. Get up on time next time.”

The squad groaned, and a few of them nudged Dubli, giving the man dirty looks.

“Don’t whine, you did this to yourselves! Now, partner up with the recruit next to you, and each grab a practice spear, and being practicing the forms we went over,” Maklo said.

Okin shivered. He hadn’t actually been present to learn any of these ‘forms’, and he couldn’t remember the last time he used a spear.  An arm wrapped around his back. 

“Don’t worry Okin, I can teach you the forms really fast and make it look like we know what we’re doing,” Gendro’s green eyes sparkled. “I’ve graduated from this type of training before, I know this stuff like the back of my hand.”

Both men got a training spear, which was really just a long wooden staff, and found an empty space in the massive room  to begin sparring. Gendro lunged back, pointing the staff’s end toward Okin with both hands, a devilish smile on his face.

Okin’s tried to mimic Gendro’s position, but his hands trembled as he clutched the staff. He nervously glanced around at the others, and to check where the Captain was.

“I’m going to do an overhead strike,” Gendro whispered. “Block up top.”

As promised, the Rothar stepped forward and readied his staff to strike over Okin’s head.

Okin both his staff in a horizontal bar, and there was a loud *thwack* from the colliding wood.

Gendro pulled backwards and pivoted to strike at Okin’s side, but gave the Ather ample time to react. Okin simply moved his bar down to block the sideswipe in a simple motion. 

“Nice one,” Gendro smiled.

Okin gave a brief nod and then moved to perform a sudden strike of his own, aimed at the Rothar’s chest.

Gendro stepped back in surprise, but blocked the attack with fair ease.

“So--- how long will we have to stay here, Okin? Like, hiding?”

Gendro gave another cue with his eyes and a gradual motion that he was going to attack Okin’s legs from below.

“As long as it takes for me to---,” Okin blocked the shot. “Get what I need, per se.”

The two backed off from the contact, and Gendro got back into a ready position. 

“And what is it you need?”

Okin waited for Gendro’s sequence and command, but the Rothar just smiled, motioning for the High Ather to approach.

“Answers.”

That much was true. 

The Ather lunged forward, twisting his forearm across his chest to strike with the tip of the staff at the Rothar.

“And perhaps the sense that I’ve done all that I could.”

The Rothar blinked with widened eyes at Okin’s unexpectedly aggressive approach, but amazingly blocked the direct shot by leaning down and backwards and pushing his own staff at a diagonal ascent towards the oncoming bludgeon.

The rapid redirection of the ample force Okin sent charging forward sent him tumbling off balance, and he hit the hardwood floor with a slam.

Blood rushed to Okin’s side and his ribs crushed inwards, and he tasted bile.  

He turned up on his belly, the staff falling out of his hand. Many of the other trainees had stopped sparring, and Gendro had knelt down over him, his mouth open as he looked over the fallen Ather.

But Okin’s ribs blew outwards again from the explosion inside his heart. His hand grasped for the staff without thought, and he threw himself upwards. 

“I’m fine,” he said, then pointed his stick towards Gendro’s fallen one. “Let’s go.”

Gendro hesitated, but as Okin didn’t flinch, he did as instructed and took his staff in hand.

“Let’s not go too---,”

Okin flung his staff at Gendro’s side, and the room shook from Gendro’s stiff block.

The Ather barely controlled the staff, but it was a rapid fury that put the Rothar entirely on the defensive. He was so shaken and riled up that he didn’t even see the shock on his friend’s face.

Okin spun around, going for Gendro’s opposite side in a twisting whirlwind.

*Thwack!*

The inexperienced attack caused Okin to stumble again, and he grunted, but didn’t fall. Gendro didn’t strike.

“Okin, this is just sparring---“

Okin flipped his staff and struck towards the same spot again, but Gendro easily blocked it. 

The Ather stepped forward, getting within Gendro’s defensive box.

He swung overhead with all his might, and the Rothar raised his staff in a horizontal block.

*Chkk!*

Wooden chips flew from the impact. Gendro screamed.

Okin staff fell from his hands, and so did Gendro’s as the Rothar clutched his bleeding face.

*What have I done?*

The rush of blood ended, and Okin fainted.
