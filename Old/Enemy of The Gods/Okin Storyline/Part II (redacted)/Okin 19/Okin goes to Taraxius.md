“Come on,” one of the guards said, tugging on Okin’s arm.

The Ather dragged his feet along the wet stone, eyes kept to the ground. His body further devolved into a rag doll, but his heart burned. Previa was right, Gendro was right. He *had* lied. He had Sacrificed his own Truth, to search for the Truth of the universe. 

And now it seemed he would not find it, yet would pay all the price.

He glanced up in short bursts every few seconds as the guards dragged him, Gendro and Trenton wherever they were going. He did not expect it, but he kept instinctively looking to Gendro and Previa, perhaps to revel in his punishment, or as a desperate attempt to see if they showed signs of forgiveness.

There was only contempt, of course. In their small caravan, only the guards did not hold obvious disdain for Okin. Even Trenton cast a deadly squint upon him.

“Go,” one of the guards pushed him from behind.  Okin finally came out of his hunch, staring up at the steps before him.

They were at Taraxius, the massive, dark fortress just in front of the Cathedral ere Aredal, which housed all the criminals awaiting trial in The Citadel.

Two Rothars, wearing armour so shiny Okin had to look away just from the reflective gleam of the torchlight, pulled open the heavy iron gate.

The guards nudged the three prisoners to walk between the gates. Okin glanced up at the glimmering white light that towered above them.

Only Aredal’s hands and face were evident. The God of Justice held out his Light in the blackened night, as always.

*Have I lost? I was Brave, yes? Or just a fool? Please help me, I don’t know what to do anymore.*

Aredal’s stone face remained still.

The guard behind him pushed him forward up the steps of Taraxius, into pure darkness.

The inner halls of Taraxius were pitch black, but a few feet in front of Okin was always visible from the torchlight behind him. His eyes adjusted rather quickly though, and the torchlight almost became an annoyance.

The guards whispered among themselves, and two of the guards split from the rest of the group, taking Trenton with them. The rest of the them, a squad of five, including the men who held Okin’s possessions, continued to escort Okin and Gendro to their cell. It seemed there was no end to the halls of this place, perhaps it was the endless clanging in the unseeable darkness from metal and stone, coming from all directions. How many criminals were in this place? 

“Stop,” one of the escorts said, and Gendro and Okin stopped creeping forward. 

There was a brutal, prolonged squeal from the iron door dragging along the concrete floor. 

“Get in,” the guards pushed Okin and Gendro into the cell. It was big enough to be a cell for two men, despite no amenities, and only one bed and a bucket.

The guards shut the door, which shrieked again until it slammed against the identically barred cell wall, and the glimmering torchlights disappeared down the corridor from where they had come. Okin’s vision didn’t fade away completely, though.

Okin stood in the centre of the room, looking around, squeezing his face between the bars to see his surroundings. Gendro was already slumped against the back stone brick wall, arms crossed and legs stretched outwards. He stared at his own feet. 

Okin turned to his old friend, and then the empty bed with the bare mattress.

“You can have the bed, Gendro. I’ll sleep on the floor,” the Ather said.

Gendro’s body remained hunched. 

“I don’t want the bed,” he said.

Okin squatted down in front of his friend like a parent speaking with a toddler. Gendro’s eyes still rested on his own feet.

“I’m sorry, Gendro. I just---I just did it to protect you,” he said.

Gendro finally peered up to Okin.

“No. You did it to protect yourself,” Gendro said. 

Okin shook his head. “No, no, no. I did---“

“If you did it to protect me---then why am I here right now?” 

Okin stumbled backwards, almost falling onto his back. Neither man uttered a word, and Gendro looked back to the floor. The rattling of the surrounding cells in the darkness seemed to stop.

“Did you really do it, Okin?” Gendro finally asked.

“Do what?”

“Meddle in the election? That is why we’re here, is it not?” Gendro said through clenched teeth.

Okin stared at his Rothar from the levelled ground, but Gendro’s eyes still did not meet his.

“It---that’s not fair. I was only setting the election back on its intended course, before *they* meddled!” Okin shouted.

Gendro finally glanced back to the Ather.

“Who’s they? Aldwin? Previa?” He asked.

Okin nodded.

“And what did they do?” Gendro asked.

“They made Arten run! He was an---artificial candidate! They knew that he was extremely similar to Trenton, and would suck away votes from Previa’s main competition!” 

Gendro raised an eyebrow. “So they forced Arten to run?”

Okin’s face scrunched. “Well---maybe! Those men, with the dark masks, they are helping too!“

Gendro inched closer, his green eyes lasering into Okin’s. 

“Okin---did they *force* Arten to run?”

Okin sputtered, forcing out a deep exhale and leaning back onto the stone ground.

“P-probably not. But he did seem scared---“

“So you told all this to Trenton, and he employed you to put a stop to it,” Gendro interrupted.

“Uhm, well---no. I told Trenton---and he told me to do nothing.”

Gendro shook his head, crossing his arms again and curling his head back down. 

“So Trenton is in prison--- only because of what *you’ve* done.”

Okin’s body shook, and he blushed.

“I--- well---,” 

Water dripped from his forehead, and swelled from the edges of his eyes.

“You could say that, yes. But it’s not what I intended. I just---”

Okin sighed, collapsing his teary face into his hands.

“I thought you were a good, honest Ather, like they all said. But I gave you every opportunity to tell me the *Truth,* just to let me help you. And now it seems like you were hiding secrets much darker than I can imagine,” Gendro said.

“Please, Gendro! I’m being honest!” Okin shouted. “I’m not hiding anything else, and I only ever wanted to do what I thought was right.”

“Well, part of me thinks you’re only telling the Truth now because it’s too late,” the Rothar said, turning away from Okin once again.

Okin stood up, his legs staggering as he did so. He leaned against the back wall, next to the bed, slumping down next to Gendro. 

He looked up to the concrete roof of the cell, and for the first time that night, finally let his mind be free.

First, there was a sharp pang from Previa’s betrayal, and the cut in his heart leaked a viscous rage.

But from his heart leaked something else, a suggestion. Perhaps all his friends wanted was the love and honesty of someone they saw as a mentor.

Okin looked to his right, back at his friend. 

Then opened his palm. It didn’t really glow, but the golden tattoo of the singular triangle pointing upwards on his palm pierced through the night as if it did. 

Okin admired it for some time, but it was the empty space on the rest of his hand, where the triangles of Bravery and Justice should have been, that really drew his attention.

It was almost as if *nothing* was burned into his skin, that the empty void in the bottom corners of his palm was more prominent than the engraving that sat proudly at the tip.

“Gendro.”

The young Rothar turned his head.

“You are right. I did not do it for you. I did lie.

“But I didn’t do it for me either. In fact, I lost everything. I Sacrificed my own Truth---in a hope to show my Bravery,\[ 2021-03-20, 2:22 PM

Perhaps change this to “so the world could know THE truth\] and to deliver a worldly Justice. I---I once said to myself that that Sacrifice would never be worth it, before---before I saw all that I have seen.”

“And what do you think now?” Gendro asked.

“I...I do not know.”

“I may not know as much as you, but I believe that being truly Brave is letting yourself get back up,” Gendro whispered. “You can still be Dedicated in every way.”

Okin took deep, slow nods.

“I *am* sorry, Gendro. I have wronged you, and in many ways, I have wronged Previa as well. Whatever my intentions, it does not change the fact that I have betrayed that which I preach to value, as well as two friends. And beyond that--- you are my Rothar, and I did not honour that sacred bond.”

Gendro wiped his eyes, and relaxed his jaw, finally meeting Okin in the eyes.

“I...I forgive you, Okin. You are a good man, and I know you *did* have good intentions. But of course, you still must re---“

The loud scratching of iron on concrete returned. The two prisoners within the cell instinctively broke their conversation, and in the doorway was an armoured Rothar who had unlocked the gate, a satchel around his back.

He pulled up his visor, and the scruffy beard of the beggar popped out.

Okin’s eyes grew, and then he shot up, his heart jumping from the prospect of freedom.

“Who---who are you?” Gendro asked, still sitting against the wall.

The vagabond moved to clasp Okin’s hand, ignoring the Rothar. 

“You can take the armour and the satchel when we leave, Okin, it’s not my style anyway. But come on, quickly, we have to move.”

Okin looked back to Gendro, motioning. 

“Come on, Gendro. This our ticket out,” he said.

Gendro stayed seated on the floor.

“I thought you didn’t have any more secrets,” he said.

“He is here to help us,” Okin said. “He used to be an Ather.”

“And what is he doing now?” Gendro asked, his eyes still to the floor.

“Well---together we are going to rid The Citadel of corruption,” Okin said, kneeling down to stretch an arm out to his friend. “But that does not matter right now. What matters is us getting out of here.”

“No. I am not going,” Gendro said.

A flash of panic stormed across Okin’s face. 

“Why in the Four not?” he said, his volume only contained by his fear of alerting the guards.

“I think if you truly seek forgiveness, if you truly seek *Justice,* if you are really Brave and willing to face the Truth---  you should face the punishment and the consequences of your actions,” Gendro said, arms crossed.

“Well, this is not your fault! You don’t deserve this! There shouldn’t be any consequences for you,” Okin said, lightly reaching his hand further down to Gendro’s. “Let’s go.”

Gendro swatted it away.

“I am going through with the consequences of my decision to stand by you as your Rothar.”

“Well then come with me!” The tears returned to Okin’s eyes, and he reached his hand down to grab Gendro’s again.  Once again, the Rothar turned it away.

“I do not think that path---the path you are heading towards--- is the right path for you. As your Rothar, I must always look out for what is the best for you, and I don’t believe that this is it,” he said softly.

“Gendro...please,” the tears flooded Okin’s eyes. “They will lock you up forever. I couldn’t live with that.”

“Then stay.”

Okin wiped the tears with his palm, and the upturned triangle of Truth glowed in his eye, becoming clearer as he pulled it away. It drew Gendro’s sight too.

“Hurry up,” the beggar said from behind them. Okin ignored him.

“If I stay, they will just lock us both up,” Okin said. 

“But we will both know that we faced the consequences of our actions. I will have done a good service as your Rothar, and you will have truly shown your Dedication,” Gendro said his eyes looking up to Okin’s.

But would he really have? The triangles of Bravery and Justice would still be missing from his palm on the day he died. He would be shunned, and his legacy ruined. And he would never know the secrets, he would never put an end to the corruption that rotted in The Citadel.

He looked to his hand one last time, then turned to the beggar, who motioned for them to leave.

Gendro’s expression remained stoic. How could the young Rothar be so at peace with his fate? The man’s emotional state had been more up and down than the Apathasawian markets; when they had met he had appeared so aloof and uncaring, then cheekily philosophical, until exploding into several emotional tirades. Now, he seemed to be at peace with whatever laid in store for him. Had Okin’s actions really changed him that much?

“Hurry, Okin, we must go. The fate of The Citadel hangs in the coming moments,” the vagabond’s voice drew in from behind.

Okin closed his eyes and sighed. He placed a hand on Gendro’s shoulder, and it shivered, but this time Gendro did not pull away. 

“I...I can’t. I’m sorry, Gendro,” Okin’s face reddened with the blood of shame, and his eyes watered again. He turned to leave the cell. The vagabond wrapped an iron gauntlet around his back and led Okin out of the cell.

“So am I,” Gendro whispered. He stayed seated on the dark, barren floor of the cell. “So am I.”
