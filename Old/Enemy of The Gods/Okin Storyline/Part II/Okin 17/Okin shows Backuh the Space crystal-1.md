As usual, the markets were bustling in the afternoon, even on this cloudy day. Commoners and clergy alike haggled for food and wares. Okin even recognized some familiar faces, Athers he knew from Central Whetland, near Ariska, taking out money and putting back things into their own satchels.

He had the urge to say hello, but he was nervous about being seen. He was sort of supposed to be dead, or at least gone from The Citadel, after all, and the clergy talked amongst themselves.

He avoided the main market square, moving around a large crowd on the main road, towards the residential street that would connect with the alley where the beggar always hid. 

A Devinar, stiff-backed and taking long strides, gave Okin a nod as he passed by. Okin returned a nervous nod at the last possible moment.

Okin shook, sweat building from his already over-heated scalp. 

Okin wondered, would he always have to be this nervous? Would he always have to imagine people talking *about* him, and be afraid at that? 

The Citadel had probably hunted Ateon, a former Ather, for some time, but the man looked so old now. Was that Okin’s destiny, living in the shadows, pretending to be a hobo, secretly plotting?

He thought back to his childhood, to his training as an Ather. He’d *never* felt this much on his toes; the only time he even remembered being nearly as conflicted as he had consistently been the past couple months was when he originally found out that Billy had murdered his father.

Now, Okin’s mind was back to piecing together the facts on Billy. He shut his eyes--- he didn’t have time to ponder *that* controversy right now.

Okin shivered as he considered the prospect of the rest of his life becoming like Ateon’s. It seemed more and more likely by the day.

The little crevice underneath the rooftops of the two desolate houses, where the deserted Ather normally stayed, looked empty besides the blankets; the man was likely in his strange little bunker. 

Okin kicked aside Ateon’s torn, dirty blankets, which revealed the pot cover.

He stomped on it. There was no response.

He did three more loud, distinct stomps. Still, no response.

Finally, he leaned down and shouted into the pothole.

“I’ve returned, it’s Okin! I have crucial information to share with you!”

Nothing. 

Okin grunted, and resorted to a succession of violent stomps.

“Why are you ruining my door like that?”

Okin jumped around in a semicircle, nearly falling down due to the weight of his armour. He held up his fist clumsily.

“Woah, woah, no need to be afraid. It’s just me. I’m glad you made it back in once piece,” Ateon laughed. He had somehow snuck up behind Okin from the alleyway. Where the man had gone while Okin was infiltrating Aldwin’s party, Okin had no clue.

“I have found something that might be of interest of you,” Okin said, in between gradually slowing breaths. “*But---* I ask for information in return.”

“What would you like to know?” Ateon asked, smiling.

“First off--- how old are you? How long have you been... hiding?”

“Longer than you can imagine,” the former Ather laughed.

Okin rolled his eyes, inching closer. “For real. How long have you been doing---*this*. Hiding out here, investigating The Citadel.”

The vagrant raised a chin to his beard. “I suspect...you are afraid that you will become like me and have to live in this... *unfortunate* situation?”

Okin stepped back, blushing. “Well, uhm, yes.”

Ateon let out another hearty laugh, placing a hairy hand on Okin’s plated shoulder. 

“Trust me, friend, I have other reasons for hiding. Soon enough, this will all be over for you, and you can go back to being an ordinary Ather. No hiding,” the vagrant’s normally repulsive smile was rather comforting. “Now tell me what you got.”

“Well--- first of all--- I actually got into one of their... meetings. I don’t think they spotted me, I had the mask on,” Okin wiped his forehead, trying not to replay the stress he had felt within that meeting. “Aldwin mentioned three names--- Impalias Vassani. not to replay the stress and , Ather Casno, and High Ather Arten. I believe Arten is running to distract votes away from some of the other candidates.”

Chin rested on is wrinkly hand, Ateon nodded. Okin felt free to go on.

“They talked about Previa a lot. He’s not exactly a part of the cult. They talk about him--- they talk about him like he’s their *tool.”*

Okin paused. He tried to read the beggar’s expression, but it was masked by his beard, and only seemed--- contemplating.

“And I---,” Okin paused as he felt his bag. “I *got* something, too.”

Ateon’s face lit up, and he inched forward. Okin took it as a cue to dig into his bag and show him the gem.

Okin did a double-take to make sure it was what he thought it was--- a Space Crystal. Honestly, the Ather hadn’t had much experience with them--- no one besides Space Heralds themselves or maybe crystal miners and merchants really did. But from the few times he had encountered them and the other crystals, he did have a pretty good image of what they looked like. 

So unless this was an extremely similar-looking rare gem, he was certain it was a Space Crystal.

Part of him wanted to ask more questions before showing Ateon the crystal, but Okin felt like obliging. He held it forward, and the vagrant reached out his own hand to inspect it.

In a strange stab of instinct, Okin pulled his arm back.

“Before you see it, I have a few more inquiries.”

The beggar sighed, rolling his eyes. “What is it?”

“You’ve obviously been at this a long time. What have you discovered that you haven’t told me? Why are they doing this? What do they want?” Okin asked, clutching the crystal with both arms, shying it away from the beggar who still continued to reach for it.

“All I know is that they control The Citadel, and they’ve changed some of its doctrine over the years,” the vagabond replied, extending his arm closer. “I’ve only found out their leadership just now, through you.”

“Why though? And why *have* you been hiding all these years?” Okin asked.

“I’ve told you all I know,” the beggar growled. He lurched forward and grabbed Okin’s hand, tugging on it. “Let me see what you found!”

Okin yanked his arm away, squeezing the crystal tight enough so the beggar wouldn’t even get a finger on it. He would not be pushed around today, he would hide the crystal indefinitely until the man finally told him what he wanted to know. The turning of his large bulk sent the beggar stumbling backward.

The beggar raised both arms as if surrendering to Okin.

“I’m sorry, I get a little annoyed when people talk too much about my past,” the vagabond said. “I honestly told you most of what I know. I know it seems strange, but I spent most of my time in hiding erasing any records that would help them find me and keeping myself from getting killed. As an actual, well-trusted Ather, you’ve done more work in weeks than I’ve managed in years.”

Okin sighed. He looked to Ateon--- the man only gave off honesty. And Okin understood that primal desperation for answers--- that had been consuming *him* for weeks.

He held out his hand to the beggar to present the crystal.

“C’mon now,” the beggar grumbled.

“Look at it, its---“

Okin’s heart froze as he saw his empty palm.

“What? I swear, I had it in my hand all along!” He frantically dug in his satchel, checking the ground around him. The Space Crystal was nowhere to be found. 

“That is---,” the beggar stopped, checking around his feet. Okin reached to the ground, feeling around. Only the rough concrete and ruffled leaves scratched his hand. 

The Crystal was dark, but like most Heraldic Crystals, it had an unmistakable glow. It was nowhere to be seen

“What was it?” Ateon asked, checking around the ground himself.

“A Space Crystal, I think,” Okin said, scratching his chin. “Could its owner have---retrieved it using Heraldry?”

The vagabond’s eyes widened, but he shook his head.

“Maybe, but I don’t think so,” he replied. “I do not know so much about Heraldry, but I think Teleportation Heralds require line of sight and can really only move themselves to things, not the other way.”

Okin scratched his head. From the little he had learned about the subject during his general studies of the world as an early Ather, that definitely checked out.

“Where could it have gone then?” Okin asked.

“Well, I have no clue,” the beggar replied. “You are *sure* you had it *just now?*”

“Yes,” Okin cleared his throat He leant down and swept his hand over the blankets on the floor just in case the crystal had somehow gotten underneath them. It hadn’t.

“Anyways,” he said, sweat building under his garments, “I found it in Aldwin’s house, in the study where the meeting was taking place. It was in his drawer. I spoke with Previa, the boy still seems oblivious to what Aldwin and the cult are doing. But what would Aldwin be doing with a Space Crystal?”

“Is it possible that he is a Space Herald?” The vagabond asked.

“I---,” Okin stopped and thought back to *any* time where Aldwin was unusually suspicious or if there were any strange things he did that were only possible through Heraldry. There wasn’t. If Okin’s memory served, Aldwin was just an ordinary old man. 

“I don’t think so. If he is, he’s kept it very well hidden, which is strange,” Okin replied.

The beggar nodded, his eyes piercing Okin’s.

“You’re sure, you had it in your hand the entire time?” 

“Yes,” Okin glanced around the ground for the third or fourth time. “It was in my satchel, I took it out to show you, then we argued, and then it disappeared.”

The beggar looked away, his expression unreadable because of the massive, scruffy beard.

“And you’re sure it was a Space Crystal?” The beggar raised an eyebrow.

Okin scratched his chin. He looked up and to the right and an image of an amethyst gem flashed in his head.

“It looked like one. Unless it was a--- a---“

“A what?” Ateon asked.

Okin shivered. The only Heraldic Crystal Okin had never seen was a *Dark Crystal.* But even in a more “worldly” town like Metheno, people didn’t talk much about *anything* to do with Dark Heraldry.

But... Aldwin hiding a Heraldry... the one Heraldry that *would* make sense would be Dark Heraldry.

“A Dark Crystal?” The words finally Okin’s lips.

“You said it was purple,” Ateon said. “Dark Crystals are---“

Ateon paused, and Okin raised an eyebrow. 

“You’ve seen one?” Okin asked.

“Oh, no,” the beggar shook his head. “I’ve only *heard* that they are, well, black.”

Okin nodded. It made sense. But the crystal he had was *definitely* amethyst.

Instinctively, the High Ather glanced to his six. There was nothing but rustling leaves in the illuminated street that led into the small, shadowed alleyway where they were crouched. 

But if Aldwin or *someone* in Aldwin’s cult had Space Heraldry... Okin could end up with a knife in his back at *any* time. They had already tracked him down and tried to kill him once--- how long before they’d try again?

Okin turned back to Ateon. He inched into the shadows. For once, he felt more comfortable hidden and shrouded in slimy Darkness than among a class of peers and mentors that formerly respected and even looked up to him.

“Okin,” Ateon’s voice dropped to a concerned whisper.

“Did you lead someone here?” 

Okin’s eyes widened. Could Ateon read his mind?

Then, he heard the footsteps approaching.
