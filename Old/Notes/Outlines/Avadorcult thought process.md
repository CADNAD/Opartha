Avador tries to convince the Council of the Monastery to pursue the artifacts more heavily. However, his efforts do little and he realizes he is failing. 

He then realizes that the only hope he has of finding them is if he feigns some sort of death for a large team of believers and can search for them independently.

He realizes that helping Billy and the party escape will be the necessary “out” that will allow him to pursue the artifacts.
