The outside air was savagely refreshing. Billy had gotten a change of clothing since he arrived here, but he\[ Outside Description here\] instead chose to wash his. Part of him regretted that decision, as he now found himself envying the warm-looking robes of many of the cultists wore as he walked through the crowd with Benjy. Some stood talking in small huddles, holding bowls of the strange, colourful cuisine Billy had seen before\[ Insert name + Descrption maybe\], while others bustled about as if they had a job to do. Some even sat around little fires.

Still, while chilly, it should have been below livable up here. Damian had offhandedly mentioned something about the Beast’s strange form of Elemental Heraldry which was said to produce the clouds around the beast. The very coulds Benjamin had said would disappear tonight. But they seemed to be just as thick as usual.\[ Describe how thck this is\] The slow, beating flapping was just as loud as before. Yet another reason why had he tried to stay inside.

“Hey!” Benjamin shouted. Tiptoeing, Billy peered over the small crowd in front of him. It a Marthian-looking man with short dark hair that Billy didn’t know. How had Benjy gotten to know so many of these people so fast?\[ Was there supposed to be an interaction here? \]

They continued shuffling through the crowd. At least Benjamin’s massive frame was easy to follow. They passed over long lines that led up to massive pots filled with steaming food.

“Hey!” Benjamin changed directions, waving to a small group that was huddled around the fire. Most of them were holding bowls, chatting, and smiling. Damian was there, wearing the identical outfit that Billy had been given. Long, white robes tied with an equally white sash at the waist. Like much of the rest of the crowd, Damian wore a fur lined cloak drawn close around his bony shoulders. The boy turned, smiling at Benjamin, his eyes lighting up further when seeing Billy.

Billy walked over to the group after Benjamin had already sat down. Damian perked up from his seat.

“Billy, you came! You should try the food tonight, it’s *really* good. In fact, I have no idea where they get all this good meat from. I was just asking Allia about it, but she doesn’t seem too sure either.”

Allia blushed, she was sitting on a rock next to Damian. The red mark had progressed into a dark bruise on her face. Billy held back a cringe. He couldn’t let the girl know that he had seen her training.

“It’s nice you decided to join us, Billy,” she said. “And yes, you *definitely* should try the food.”

Billy peered over his shoulder at the rows of line. It was still dozens of people long even at the shortest spot.

“Maybe later,” he said. “I’ll just sit here and relax for a bit.”

Damian smiled. Then the boy opened his eyes and mouth, raising a finger. 

“Oh, Billy, I forgot to tell you! Avador and I found out that I’m a Summons Herald!”

Billy cocked an eyebrow. “But I thought I’ve seen you use Mind Heraldry before?”

“That’s the thing, Billy,” Damian’s smile took a mischievous turn. “I’m both!”

Billy’s eyes widened. Being a Herald himself, he had heard tales of dual-Heralds back in his childhood and in Apathasaw. While he knew they logically did exist, they might as well have been myths with how rare they were.

*So, it must mean he’s actually gotten to using his powers. Well, I guess that’s...great.*\[ Maybe he can want Damian to not get good with his powers so he can still be useful and protect him.\]

Billy smiled. “That’s wonderful, Damian. Just---,” he glanced to Allia, and then leaned in closer to his brother. “Just make sure that you aren’t training too hard, okay? That you don’t get *too* wrapped up in all this shit.”

Damian’s lips pursed, then he gave Billy a nod.

“I know you already said you didn’t want to, but you should really try, Billy. If you don’t like it, you can stop, but I know you’ll love it. It’s just like---it’s just like if you got to go train at the Time Institute.”

Billy shivered. Hearing about *that* at the court back in Metheno once was already painful enough. Still, the excitement in Damian’s eyes--- had he been that excited about becoming a real, true master of Heraldry back---before? Whatever that little being was inside his chest---that was *thrilled* by the opportunity to become a better Herald while also pleasing Damian. And just the opportunity for something *new.*

Billy turned back to his brother. 

“Okay, I’ll try.”

Damian jumped out off the log, his hands shooting to the sky. Why was the teen *this* excited? It’s not like Billy’s decision would *really* affect him in any way.

Allia smiled, and then grimaced, clutching the side of her face.

“You’ve made the right decision, Billy,” she said. Her attempt at a soft smile was gnarled into one of pain by the bruising on her face.

Even after all that, she still endorsed them. That idea that anything had that much power over a perosn made Billy’s stomach sink. 

“Oh---“ Billy said, “Wh-what happened?\[ More Specific dialog here maybe? Just mention face. Also doesn’t really sound like Billy\]”

Allia’s eyes widened, and then she let out a forced laugh, followed by another wince. \[ You use the sentence structure a lot\]

“Oh, this, it’s nothing,” she said, pointing to her own face. “I simply fell is all.”

Why would she lie? Because she didn’t want to make the training look brutal? But how would that advantage her?\[ Almost all of Billy’s internal monologue is questions to himself. \]

“It looks *pretty* bad,” Billy said. “Are you sure that’s what happened?”

“Uh-uhm, yes, I am sure,” her cheeks reddened under the bruise\[ Anger reaction at Billy prying might work better here?\]. 

The two’s slight seperation from the rest of the group allowed them to sit in awkward, uninterrupted silence. To the side, Benjamin was laughing it up with some other cultists Billy didn’t know as food flew out of his mouth. Billy bit his lip. Yes, it did appear like Benjamin was right about the girl, she didn’t seem *malicious*  Yet, she was still hiding *something*. 

“Ah, look at that,” Allia said, pointing to the sky. The roof of clouds was gone, and for the first time Billy had arrived, the stars shone in the black night’s sky.\[ This should probably be a more of a wow moment. \]

The rhythmic gust of the beast’s wings was louder now than before, and thankfully for his heart, he could only see their faint outline in the darkness. In fact, all he could really see was the smiling faces around the fire. The same glimmer from the stars shined in Damian’s eyes. When was the last time he’d seen this joy from his brother?

Billy smiled, patting his brother on the back. The stars twinkled above, but unlike their mockery during his drunken stupor, they seemed to instead be congratulating him, cheering him on. For once, he pressed down the little voice inside him that told him it was too good to be true.

“Maybe I’ll finally get to put a smile on little twelve year old Billy’s face and become a legendary assassin like he always wanted,” Billy chuckled.

“You wanted to be an assassin?” Allia raised an eyebrow. “At twelve?”

“Yeah, I was always a real dark kid.” Billy’s lips curled into a smirk.

“Dad always said Billy couldn’t even hurt a fly. I remember once he tried to bring a Gran\[ What’s a Gran?\] home, maybe so he could have a friend as rough as he was,” Damian laughed.

Billy gave Damian a friendly punch in the shoulder, and the three of them went on laughing, sharing jokes around the fire. Around them, people started getting in small groups and doing weird jigs he had never seen before, but had to admit were marvelous to watch. Some were unbelievably coordinated and skillful, including rapid flips, jumps, and contortions of the body. 

Then, they got Heraldry involved, and even Billy marveled at the amazing stunts; balancing through dozens of rings of fire, throwing men and women up halfway to the stars, who landed in totem poles, pyramids, and rainbows made entirely of people.\[ I think this might be a good place to show at least some of these. Just as a showcase of the power cap\]

Allia and Damian both stood up and cheered at the show, and Benjamin kindly brought Billy over a beer and some strange orange meat. Billy took a sip, but then continued watching the show, his lips not touching the glass for the rest of the night.

The party stretched way into the night, much past what Damian’s ‘bedtime’ was back in Apathasaw. The little voice still tried to pry its way up into Billy’s head, cautioning him about the future, the motivations of this Monastery, and whatever secrets Allia was hiding, but it was drowned out by the laughter, the cheering, and the hopeful beating of his own heart. For one day, all the clouds were clear from the sky.
