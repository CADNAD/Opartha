Personality

MBTI: FeSiNeTi (ESFJ)

\-Okin is very pious, and he genuinely tries to follow doctrine to the best of his ability. He believes in upholding and furthering the values of Moden Versalism, especially those written by the Pact early on.

\-Okin is quite good at seeing through other’s facades. He has to speak against his friend Previa as he knows that Aldwin and him are propping him up despite the fact they both know he would be a bad Impalias.

\-Okin is friendly, but also very honest. 

Occupation

\-High Ather

Habits/Mannerisms


Background

\-Okin grew up in Metheno, among middle-class, very religious parents. His father was a talented craftsman of the middle class, but was friends with both William Blu, one of the most prominent merchant traders in Metheno, and Aldwin Salzar, a high-ranking and respected High Ather, who later became Impalias. 

Internal Conflicts

\-Okin is unsure whether he believes his childhood friend Billy’s story, or whether he is just biased because of their former relationship. After the sentence is guilty, but Billy escapes, Okin is still troubled by the conflict, but there isn’t much action he can take.

\-Okin often struggles with truly living by the doctrine of the Gods, and that isn’t because he doesn’t truly wish to be faithful. It is just that he is often put into situations where either way, he will be bending one of his beliefs.

\-Okin struggles with the fact that later doctrine has demonized anyone born with dark heraldry, which has given motive for many towns to execute dark heralds. 

External Conflicts

\-Okin must go up against his friend Previa in the election, supported by his father, Aldwin. Okin knows that Previa doesn’t care enough about Versalism and would be a bad Impalias, and out of principle he must run against him.

Notes

\-Okin is unsure about wether or not Ty-Shou is a god. He is waiting for other gods to appear again.
