“*Okin*?”

The High Ather’s senses skyrocketed again and his head whipped to the direction of the voice. He stepped back onto his right leg and even raised a hand to his chest. 

His body naturally relaxed as he saw nothing but an innocent-eyed boy in a colourful but unthreatening vest, but his jaw dropped and he took another step back as his mind realized it was *Previa.* 

The young Ather was uncomfortably half-leaned up against the perfectly-trimmed bush. For once, he looked--- *unimpressed*.

“You came to father’s party?” Previa asked.

Okin froze. He didn’t know if he should be talking to Previa right now, but it would look utterly strange and suspicious if he just *ran off.* And what if the boy told Aldwin?

“Well I--- I thought it was your party,” Okin stuttered.

“Yes, yes, father is telling everyone it is *my* party,” Previa rolled his eyes. “But it’s just some weird excuse to do something I don’t even understand. He--- he doesn’t even actually want me *at* the party. I was actually supposed to go down to the Cathedral ere Nolor to meet a few Athers and try to get their votes, but I--- I don’t know. I just didn’t want to. I’m not sure if I still want to *be an* Impalias, if I’m ready.”

The young Ather looked up at Okin with eyes pleading for some sort of affirmation or comfort. Okin wanted to say something, but the words were caught in his throat, and he just looked at Previa with similarly shocked eyes.

“I don’t really understand any of this,” Previa sighed and looked back to the ground. “But... I suppose one day I will. You and father have never really been wrong. If this is what---”

“No, Previa,” Okin interrupted. “You’re right. Maybe Aredal is trying to tell you something.  This *is* happening very fast, and the Gods have plans for us all.”

Previa nodded off in thought. Okin stared at the boy, thinking about how to tell him about the crazy conspiracies he had just uncovered. But frankly, Okin hadn’t even had enough time to process all the information *himself.*

Okin opened his mouth to make a remark, but Previa raised an eyebrow first.

“Where have you *been*, Okin?” the young Ather asked. “I came looking for you at the visitor’s complex yesterday, and just a few minutes ago I run into Gendro who asks me if I’ve seen you anywhere!” The young Ather let out a dry chuckle. “I thought that maybe there was a confusion and you left back to Ariska already.”

Okin remembered how long it had been since he had even *thought* of his own town. Now peaceful, simple Ariska seemed like another world, another time. He had clear memories of the shining green plains and the bright smiles of the rural workers and their smiling children, but it seemed so... foreign.

“I--- I've---,” Okin’s lip quivered. He wanted to tell the Truth, but how would he even start? *I’ve been investigating your father?* *I was attacked by an assassin wearing a mask like a raven and then with the help of a deserted Ather who has been posing as a beggar, have been trying to find out whatever your father is trying to do with this weird secret cult?*

Okin’s train of thought was cut short. Laughter came from the other side of the bushes. From within Aldwin’s yard.

Okin’s  shoulders rose, and he glanced back to the street.

*Are they leaving the party?* He trembled. 

Either way, he didn’t have enough time to tell Previa everything. He thought back to what he heard in the cult’s meeting. They had described him as a *roadblock.* They had talked about *controlling* him, and only *eventually* getting him on their side.

He looked back at Previa’s shining emerald eyes, which stared emptily at the ground.

*Is this--- is this even what he wants?*

“Previa,” Okin grabbed the young Ather by the shoulders. “I don’t have enough time to explain now. Your father--- he cannot know I was here. I know, it seems dishonest, but you have to trust me.”

“How can I just trust you when I have *no idea* what is going on?” Previa shouted with uncharacteristic force.

Okin’s breath quickened. “I---I don’t have time right now. Is there anywhere we can meet soon? I’ll tell you everything.”

“What about the visiting complex?” Previa asked.

Okin looked to the right corner of his eye, where Aldwin’s gate was. He thought of Gendro, and how... difficult it would be to return to the visiting complex if the Rothar found him there.

“I-I can’t. Is there anywhere else you can go?” Okin asks.

“Father keeps me on a pretty tight leash here, and recently he’s had Rothars and Devinars around *all the time* when he’s gone. If you can’t meet here--- I think I’ll have some extra free time after speaking with the Arbiter of Justice this Wednesday at 3\[ 2022-01-22, 3:24 PM

Figure out how time works lol\]. Father is due at the Seat, and apparently the Arbiter doesn’t like extra visitors, so no Rothars will be accompanying me. I should be able to meet you outside the church then, but only for a few minutes.”

Okin nodded incessantly. “Okay. I’ll meet you there. But promise me, Previa--- promise me that you won’t tell Aldwin of any of this.”

The young Ather froze. The sound of chatter crept in from behind the bushes again.

“Promise me, Previa, promise me!” Okin shook the boy wildly.

Right then, there was laughter again and the sound of Aldwin’s front gate squeaking open.

Okin turned his head and caught several shadows in the corner of his eye. 

Without looking back, he sprinted off.
