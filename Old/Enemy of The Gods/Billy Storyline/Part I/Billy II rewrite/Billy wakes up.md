“Billy! Billy!”

Billy’s body shook as Damian’s sickly face faded into view. The boy’s eyes inches away from Billy’s. His eyelids were outstretched, showing the entirety of his sclera. 

Billy wheezed, turning away and covering his mouth with his left arm as he hacked. Damian released his grip from Billy’s shoulder, stepping away.

The cowboy’s hands were dry and cut. Looking at his arms, and behind his back, he confirmed that his entire backside was covered dust and dirt. He could also feel the hair on the back of his head was tangled and sandy. 

“Goddamn it, what happened?” Billy shouted.

“You were lying here, knocked out when I got up. We better get going before the owner of this property spots us.” 

Instinctively, Billy looked down at his watch. 07:24. Not too late.

Damian grabbed Billy’s jacket from the empty stable. 

“Thanks Billy,” Damian said, a small chuckle escaping as he handed him the jacket, which was clean.

*The fuck? Does he think this is funny?*

Billy snatched the jacket from Damian’s hands. He didn’t want to put it on, the dirt would probably get on the inside of his jacket, and he’d never be able to get it out. Hesitantly, he slid his arms through the sleeves. 

He cringed; there was some ickiness in the armpit areas. Still, he didn’t have time to focus on it now. They had to be going.

“Let’s move!” Billy shouted, and they ran through the fields towards the main road.
