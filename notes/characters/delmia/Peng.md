Habits/Mannerisms


Background

Peng’s father is a Beisanian aristocrat while his mother is Delmian. Growing up in a split family, Peng found himself more aligned with Imperial values and upholding the Empire, as his father taught him. Determined to serve the Empire but also loyal to the Delmian nation, he enlisted in the army but his scrawny build and asthma caused him to be quite unsuccessful. With his father’s funding, he enlisted to study to become a CO.

Internal Conflicts

Peng, like Liu, battles with being loyal to the Empire vs being loyal to Delmia.
