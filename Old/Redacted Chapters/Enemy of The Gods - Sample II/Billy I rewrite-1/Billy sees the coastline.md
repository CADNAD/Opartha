Billy and Benjamin made their way over to the back rail of the ship, bottles in hand. Billy did a double-check; the rest of the crew had relegated themselves back to maintenance duties, and Damian still sat at the table, drawing.

“So,” Benjy clinked his bottle against Billy’s, and took a shot. “I know you don’t want me to ask, but I must. You’ve never talked much about travelling before. Why all this effort to come here?”

Billy just stared out at the endless rapids, and took a sip of his drink.

“Yes, the land is luscious and green, but here there are so many rules and restrictions,” Benjamin continued. “I wouldn’t trade the nicest farmland in Opartha for freedom and hard-earned-money.”

Billy didn’t even shake his head at Benjamin’s statement; in fact, he didn’t seem to acknowledge the man was there at all.

“Billy?” Benjamin leaned over the deck to get a better look at his friend.

“You know I don’t want to talk about it, so don’t ask. It’s none of your damn business, anyway,” Billy took another chug of beer. 

Benjamin pulled back from the deck, and he too took another drink.

“Sorry.”

“It’s fine,” Billy replied through tight lips as he stared out at the golden horizon.

“Hey!”

Billy whipped around. By instinct, his fingers reached for his waist, but his nerves cooled themselves as he saw it was only Damian shouting from the deck above.

“Look, come to the front of the ship! You can see the coastline! We’re here!” Damian shouted.

“Seriously, Damian!” Billy shouted back. “You scared the shit out of me!”

“Sorry!” The dark-haired boy cupped his hands to shout back. “But come on!”

Billy shook his head, but he couldn’t help but smile. He blew on the inside of his hat again--- it seemed dry of beer.

“Well,” Benjamin said. “You comin’?”

“Fine,” Billy sighed. 

He placed the hat on his head, and cringed as it felt stickier than usual. 

Looking back one last time at the long lines of foam trailing the ship, Billy followed his friend to see what the fuss was all about.

As Billy arrived at the front bow, he heard a cawing sound. Five or six small black birds were gliding over the ship.  

Leaning over the deck, Damian looked out with glee. His usual mop of hair flew out in all directions. His smile widened as he looked back to Billy and Benjamin, and he pointed out past the front of ship.

“Look! Out there! Really far, but it’s there!” He shouted.

Billy inched forward to the deck and narrowed his gaze. His surroundings slowed. The rushing waves became more like a still pond, and the gusting winds which made Damian’s hairs flap around violently instead held them still in the air towards the East. Billy’s gaze focused on the birds, the usual blurry flapping slowed so he could observe each powerful thrust of the wings, each keeping the sleek body balanced and high in the sky.  He scrutinized the more subtle flap of the tail, which propelled the birds forward in a sharp thrusting motion. Avians, which were normally so smooth and continuous in flight, like it was all just one continuous motion forward, looked as rigid as a man chopping wood at this speed.

And far, far off in the distance, the crystal-clear blue waters crashed against a single rocky cliff, and white foam froze around it. The first land Billy had seen in what felt like years.

With a short blink, everything returned to normal and the birds quickly flew past the ship and out of sight. The waves continued to crash violently against the ship and each other, and once again the hair of the crew traveled in all directions from the blowing wind. From the far horizon, more rocky coastlines and sandy shores inched into view. Here they were, the oldest of modern civilizations, and the former frontier of possibility, though some still claimed it was. Wreathward.

“Finally, we’re here, Billy!” Damian shouted with glee. Knowing what Damian would likely say next, Billy glanced to Benjamin and scowled.

Damian turned back to the open seas and shouted, “We’re home!”
