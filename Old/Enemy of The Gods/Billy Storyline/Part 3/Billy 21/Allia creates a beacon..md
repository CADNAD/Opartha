Billy followed Allia through the dense jungle. He was shivering. Despite having no intention of coming to this place, he *did* somewhat snort at the tales of Krinosas being a *frozen* jungle. It just didn’t really seem to make any sense.

Well, now the only snorting he was doing was to warm up his nostrils. 

It seemed to be quite a bit warmer within the parts of the forest completely encapsulated by canopies and foliage. Billy assumed that was why Allia had brought them into the jungle.

But now Billy was just aching from the cold. Weirdly, a spot on the left side of his chest was the itchiest, but he could barely scratch it as it was covered by his shirt and duster, and he didn’t *dare* remove what clothes he had. 

He could finally make out the sun reaching through from the other side, which was a good sign.

He also hadn’t seen much wildlife... which from the little tales he was told, was also a good sign.

*Ksss-ksss-kssstttt,* a rattling noise shook from above. He instinctively slowed time, bent his knees and reached for his holster. His fingers squeezed and clutched empty air.

No gun. He glanced down for a second and looked up at the canopies of dark, slimy leaves. There was the tiniest shake of the wind, but no more rattling. 

His eyes followed a rustle--- but he quickly realized it was just Allia continuing on ahead. 

He looked up one last time, and after noticing nothing for a while, continued on ahead.

That was one of several times he had heard a noise. He had *seen* no wildlife,  but he had heard plenty, and he certainly knew they were there. 

Perhaps they were smart enough to not step out in this freezing cold.

He continued towards the sound of Allia’s rustling, snaking through the trees. With such clunky boots sometimes he had a hard time making it through thin gaps in the leaves that Allia always preferred, and plus, she was quite a bit thinner then him.

He also wasn’t used to his hair being so *wet.* The thought made him miss his hat.

*Why the Raut are thinking about your dumb hat right now?* Damian’s *life could be hanging in the balance!* 

*Think...think! How could they have survived, and where would they be?*

*Maybe--- maybe Benjamin could have used some of the ship and created some sort of raft for them both with his Heraldry.* 

*But then they should have ended up near us if they just floated with the current.* 

“Allia,” Billy shouted ahead. She stopped her march and turned her head to look back at him. She glanced up at the mass of rope-like vines stretched out above, crossed over each other like a connection of webs between the massive trees.

“What is it?” She asked.

Billy stepped over the end of a log that was sticking out of the dirt. Only the very edge of the stump was exposed, and it appeared to angle downwards farther into the dirt, the majority of it being completely submerged in the ground. It was also covered in a bed of fluorescent, moss-like plants.

“After I went unconscious, and we floated towards Krinosas, did you see any other survivors, of chunks of ship, or anything?” 

Allia shook her head. 

“I stayed inside the vault almost the whole time after I got both of us inside. I had to use some of the display cases to help hold the doors closed against the rushing tides, and didn’t dare to open the doors until I was sure we were beached,” she said. “And of course I saw no one after we got out.”

She looked over to Billy with sympathetic eyes as they walked. He gave a reserved nod.

Billy heard the sound of waves crashing in the distance, and he could finally make out patches of grey in the gaps of the trees. 

He rushed past Allia, planting his boots deeper in the dirt with every step as not to slip. She quickly followed in pursuit.

He sprinted toward the light, dodging thick tree stumps and vines. Ferns were crushed under his boots, and he heard Allia’s footsteps speeding up behind his own.

He stopped as he approached a last row of vines, which reached far down from the canopies above. He gently moved them aside with his hands and stepped forward onto the sand.

He quickly raised a hand over his eyes to block out the sun. Though the light was bright, instead of a usual yellow tinge it appeared to be almost white, as the sun was filtered through a mass of grey clouds which seemed to encapsulate the Strait, Krinosas and its surroundings like a cloth wrap.

Allia’s steps came from a thundering stomp to a halt. Billy took a squinted glance at her as she looked out at the surroundings.

The Strait, while still rough and quickly heading West, was like a duck’s pond compared to how it was when the Leviathi attacked. 

Billy stomped around in the sand. The last time he had sunk into any was back in the deserts of Apathasaw. It hadn’t been that long, but it seemed like an eon ago.\[ 2022-01-08, 11:56 AM

“There it is,” Allia pointed down the beach to the West. Billy stepped forward to get a better view; in the distance he saw a massive, too-square dark metallic box beached on the edge of the coast.

Though Billy had seen the inside of its walls when the ship was still intact, its sharp, black metal looked almost alien extracted from the rest of the ship.

Billy stepped out onto the sand. His eyes were glued to the massive stretch of cloudy sky and endless darkened navy waters which together appeared like an endless void of death, like something only perceived in a dream.

With each step, he felt as though land could have faded into view, but of course there was just more greyness. He looked down at the sand, itself so grey and empty; the only proof of tampering being his and Allia’s footprints. To the left and to the right there was nothing except that blackened square being swallowed by the blackened waters among the grey sky and the grey sands.

The only sounds was a strangely rhythmic crashing of the waves, Allia’s footsteps, and his own.

He glanced back to her, as if to confirm that the sound was real and she was not alone. In doing so, he caught a glimpse of the endless jungle they had escaped behind, which stretched on endlessly both East and West.

It was the only scenery with even a hint of chroma, but yet evoked the feeling of emptiness as much as the rest of the surroundings. From even a good fifty feet away, the top was imperceptible, as if the jungle trees melded into the sky to create this inescapable bubble. If one continued to look beyond the jungle leaves at what was behind, all that was a visible was blackness. Billy could not imagine what, if anything, would be on the other side of this monstrous biome.

Billy turned back around towards the waves. Though he knew that on the other side of the Strait lay the North of Wreathward, here, too, it seemed that the only possibility was endless waves.

*How could there be a place in our world as desolate and lifeless as this?* He thought. He felt *removed* in a sense from reality, like he was caught in some sort of twisted fever dream, that this could not possibly even be in the same universe as Wreathward or Apathasaw

The sailors had told tall tales of Krinosas for its dangerous wildlife and sense of mystery. Yet here, among the coast of the uncivilized continent, Billy witnessed nothing but the purest expression of emptiness.

On these grey sands, Billy was wedged between the edges of two endless voids. 

He shook his head and shut his eyes. His feet dug into the sand, and Allia’s footsteps came to an end.

He jumped at a deep shock around his ankles--- a frigid stab. His eyes popped open--- he hadn’t noticed that he had walked right up to where the waves settled into the sands.

The wave retreated. He re-closed his eyes and re-sunk is feet. 

He heard the sound of the waters beginning their approach, and he took a deep breath.

He embraced the feeling, the screaming sensations in his mind. It was preferable to the absolute numbness this place so blatantly encouraged.

And a great reminder of the true panic at hand.

He opened his eyes, and turned around to meet Allia’s. She looked on in confusion, as if she had been only watching him this whole time.

“Ok. Let me see the map,” Billy stepped forward, and Allia pulled it out.

The map was unlike any Billy had ever seen. Most of the maps in Apathasaw were extremely plain and practical, as they were mass-produced. The others he remembered were extremely vivid and stylized--- likely as they were more like collector’s items of his father. He also somewhat remembered noticing other ones of similar style in Kiatus’ Vault.

This one, however, could only be described as incomplete. The ink and even handwriting looked different in different sections of the map, and it was all the more noticeable as there was massive gaps in the map itself. 

Billy rotated the map and glanced back to the jungle.

*Actually, considering this is Krinosas, even this map must’ve taken a ton of work.*

He did a 180 of the surroundings while intermittently glancing down at the map.

“Do you---“

“Have any idea where we are on the map?” Allia intejected. “No, not really.”

“I do believe we floated pretty far West though. We’re probably around here.”

Allia slid her finger along the West edge of the map.

“Okay,” Billy said. “I’ll explore to the East first, then. You ready to Light the beacon?”

Allia nodded. 

“Ready as I’ll ever be.”

“Oh, and by the way,” Allia handed Billy the map. He rolled it up and stuck it in his jacket pocket. “I can’t maintain the beacon indefinitely. And I’ll probably have to find whatever food is on this continent sooner or later. I’ll try to not be gone longer than an hour, but no promises. 

“Wait a second. Is there any way you can--- like--- write with the Light, or something?” Billy asked.

Allia shook her head. 

“Yeah, that’s probably just about as silly as I thought it was,” Billy grunted.

“Well, it’s a fair point you bring up,” Allia said. “How are they going to know that it’s us?”

“I guess I have to trust that Damian will figure it out. He’s a smart kid. And unlike me, he’d follow a so-called beacon of hope without thinking about it first,” Billy said. “And there shouldn’t be that many lost Light Heralds on the Krinosian coast.”

Billy thought of a jest, but he bit his lip. It seemed to dire of a time to make one, and this new world seemed to suck out all traces of humour.

*Maybe some lightheartedness is exactly what we need.*

“After all, we’re probably the only ones stupid enough to get stuck here.”

Allia let out a small chuckle, and Billy smiled. 

His mind immediately reminded him of what was at stake, and he crushed the little feeling of joy. Every second counted now.

He shook his head and marched forward. He had comforted Allia and brought her to his side at last, and even made her question her faith a little. Now all his focus should entirely be on what really mattered--- finding Benjy and Damian.

He nodded to Allia, and she returned a firm nod back. He flew into a run along the coast, his still-soaked boots making darkened imprints against the grey sands.

He glanced back at the massive column of perfect white light behind him. It reached up into the clouds, higher than he could possibly see.

He turned back around and hasted his sprint with a confident smile.\[ 2022-01-04, 6:23 PM
