“Gendro, Gendro!” Okin knocked hurriedly on the door to the Rothar’s guest room, being careful not to let his other fingers slip from the pages of the book.

“Coming!” Gendro swung open the door. Uncharacteristically, the Rothar actually looked *exhausted*, and the dozens of books chaotically unfurled over his bed didn’t help. For the past few hours, Okin had felt the same--- but now there was *Light* in his eyes.

“Look!” Okin held out the book for Gendro and pointed to the passage. He slid it over the entire rest of the page. 

“Read all this! It *proves* that the places and people in the Fourth Book are real, and---“

Okin shut up and let himself catch his breath. Gendro would see for himself.

“The Tironese, though large in number, were quite inferior in terms of technology based on the abandoned villages discovered in the area,” Gendro read off the page. “The only tools found in the area were spears with different heads the they used for farming, hunting, and even animal containment.”

Gendro scanned ahead, and Okin almost jumped up and down like a little boy as he waited for the eureka.

“However, though the Tironese would likely have been an attractive target for enemy tribes in Vianarya as they had control of a huge amount of farmland and resources, they did not appear to have any tribal enemies or raiders. This may be why the Tironese population had grown so large and appeared to continue in exponential growth.”

Gendro paused, and his eyes widened.

“But even with that fact, the Tironese would be an unremarkable primitive tribe. The remarkable thing about the Tironese--- is that they seemingly disappeared from history nearly 1300 years ago.”

“Sure, many may attribute this to the Vianaryan Aeroblaze, which most modern historians believe advanced northwards from the south of the continent, but Tironese remnants were discovered in areas that were seemingly unaffected by the Aeroblaze, and though there were no signs of human activity, animal and wildlife that were destroyed by the Aeroblaze still grew in these ares. However, there were no further technological advancements or signs of activity past the point that the tribal villages within the area of the Aeroblaze had achieved.”

“Stranger yet, when Trentanian explorers discovered the abandoned Tironese villages, they appeared as if they had been left untouched for hundreds of years, despite many competing tribes in the area. The other tribes appeared to be completely averse to even stepping on Tironese territory, though they were the ones that had deemed the lost tribal area *Ti-ron*.”

“Without these tribes, we may never have known about the lost people of Tiron. But there is no doubt they did exist, and just as there is no doubt that they no longer.”

Gendro’s eyes rested in silence on the passage for some time, but finally he looked up at Okin and his jaw dropped in realization. 

“Ti- Ti-ron! Yes, that was in the book! The Gods--- it seemed that they were temporarily living among the Tironese!” He shouted.

“But look!” Okin swung his satchel forward and hastily dug for another book. He opened it to the page he had bookmarked with a feather.

“I skipped just the pages that you found were lazily ripped out. And look!”

Gendro leaned in closer as Okin slid his finger down the page. 

The Rothar’s eyes widened, and Okin took another look at the deathly page.

“Ti-ron... have? Gone?” Gendro raised an eyebrow.

Okin raised his hand. “No, Ti-ron *are*---“

“Tiron are gone,” Gendro finished. “Tiron are gone. Tiron are gone. Tiron are gone. Tiron are gone.”
