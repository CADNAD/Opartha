Allia stared out into the endless sky. The Light within warmed her, or at least she suspected it did, as everyone else was shivering. Like Damian, who shook the crate he sat upon, pulling his arms into his body. 

“Uhm---ex-excuse me?”

Allia turned to face the boy.

“Where are we go-going?” Damian asked.

“I already told you,” she smiled. “The Tsuman Monastery.”

“B-but why are we so high---“

“Here,” she said, strutting over. She shuffled through the small cards she held, all the same size with a strange little scribble on them. She handed one of the cards to him. 

“Try to find it,” she said. “When you find it, we’ll be there.”

Damian inspected the card in his lap, leaning forward with wide eyes. After a while, he just kept it in his hands, and Allia returned to the stern of the ship, staring outwards again.

“Where are you f-from, Allia?” Damian asked.

“The Tsuman Monastery,” she replied.

“Oh. T-Then where were you b-born?”

“I was born there too,” she leaned against the side of the ship.

“Oh,” Damian said.

“Where were *you* born?” 

“I don’t---I don’t remember,” Damian said. “The first thing I remember is Billy’s house.”

Allia turned, raising an eyebrow. “Ah. Billy’s parents, they never spoke about where they---they adopted you from?” 

“Dad always just said I was a gift that fell from the sky,” Damian replied.

Allia tapped the side of the boat. *There’s no way that we---no.*

“I saw you at the court---the power you used, it’s not easy to do,” Allia said.

Damian looked back down to the card, fiddling with it in his hands. “I don’t even know what power *that* was. I just tried to use the---um, influence. Whatever that was, I had no idea.”

Allia nodded. “I didn’t think you were a fool. Just inexperienced.”

Damian’s head hung to the floor. 

“The Monastery can help a lot with that,” she said, smiling. “But I’m surprised you haven’t gotten much on your own. I would think being a Mind Herald would be very useful, especially in Apathasaw.”

“When we found out I was a Dark Herald, father made sure to hide it as best as possible. I didn’t even know what it was for a long time, and he didn’t tell Billy until a lot later. After---after father’s death, Billy just took care of me and I stayed inside, like before. It’s only recently that I think he wants me to use it. But, there is also the---the nightmares,” Damian squirmed in his seat, adjusting the barrel. 

“You guys---you came back to see your father?” Allia asked.

Damian just nodded.

“Did it really happen as he said? Did the *Synodontis* really kill your father?”

Damian paused, looking out to the sky.

“I-I do not know. I---I think so.”

Allia nodded, turning back to stare at the forward sky. So much history, for what first appeared to just be a grumpy cowboy and his meek little brother.
