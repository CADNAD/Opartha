Okin’s eyes blew open, but his nose and throat were clogged and dry. He breathed heavily from his mouth, his chest moved up and down rapidly. It had been a nightmare, or more of a recollection, of the execution he had just seen days prior.

The Ather was in pain, but he could barely force himself out of bed. The past few days had entirely consisted of the same--- meeting different Athers, trying to find out any information they knew about these secrets of The Citadel that he was still in the dark on, and then trying to gain the trust of ones who didn’t seem completely oblivious. So far, few and far between seemed to have any idea of what he was talking about, and even less gave off any sort of information or tells. He hadn’t gone to visit the beggar since the day he had convinced Trenton to protect him, and he wasn’t planning to go back until he had vital information. The less time he spent with the strange man, the better.

But today he actually had a chance of receiving some sort of information. Previa would come to tell Okin about Aldwin’s activities, and Okin would join the movement that Breslo had talked about. 

Okin finally pushed himself out of bed. 

He opened the curtains, and his eyes turned away, squinting as the bright light entered the room. Okin had slept in late; walking around the massive city for the past three days was a tiring activity for a usually mostly inactive Ather.

What was he to do? He couldn’t go scouting, Previa would arrive soon. Instinctively, Okin pulled out of the piece of ragged paper from his pocket, and unfolded it.

The small excerpt he had gotten of this Fourth Book of Nexon had occupied his mind for the past few days. He had ignored the Cathedral ere Olitheon, it was a massive collection of information throughout the ages, but there was no way he would be able to find what he actually wanted. Plus, the beggar was probably right: anyone who hid the secrets would probably have them removed from such a public well of information.

He sat back down on the bed, sighing as he continued to read. Every time, he thought about a few lines over and over again in his head, usually the last three. This time, a different section of text caught his eye--- the start.

*We created it out of love, out of a hope to maintain balance in this world, or at least that’s what he always says. But does he really believe in balance? He has always sought to order us around as he sees fit. That isn’t balance in my eyes.*

Okin had concluded that Nexon, or whoever had written this book was referring to his brother, Olitheon, every time he used ‘he’ or ‘him’ in this short passage. The opinion that he held of his brother was much more disdainful than that which was shown in the three books of Nexon that appeared in the Versalist Bible. This fact alone made Okin believe the excerpt he’d be given, as well as the concept of the Fourth Book of Nexon as a whole, was a sham.

*But Previa claimed Aldwin had told him that the book was real. Could Previa be lying to me? He would never. Perhaps this excerpt I’ve been given will make sense with more context, or perhaps there really is a Fourth Book, but the vagabond holds a faux copy.*

Okin shook his head, wrinkling up the paper again. Harping on the hypotheticals wouldn’t give him an answer.

A knock came from the door. Okin stood up from the bed in surprise, it was even later in the day than he had thought.

Previa’s usual joyous look was void, instead replaced by one of anxiety. Perhaps it had something to do with the large bruise on his left cheek.

“Hello, Previa,” Okin said. “Come in.”

Previa stepped into the room, and Okin closed the door behind him.

“Did you find anything for---“

“I followed father. I followed him when he went out into the city. He went from our manor towards the middle ring, on the North side of The Citadel. I had to trail quite a bit behind, he would have been furious if he knew I was following him. But then I lost him in a crowd of Rothars who were doing some sort of training exercise,” Previa said, his lightning breath almost as fast and panicked as his words. “So I went home, and the next day I tried again. This time, he went to a different place, in the outer ring, towards the Eastern side. These streets were residential, and much less crowded, so I had to stay even *further* behind him to not be spotted. I saw him turn down an alley from a bit away, and when I went down the same turn, he was nowhere to be seen! I looked around the area for several minutes, retracing both my steps and the path that father took, but there was nothing to be found. I turned to head home, but out of nowhere came these men in dark robes and black masks, like--- like beaks,and they beat me to a pulp. The next day, father stayed inside, he was terrified of what happened to me and spent the day relieving my pains.”

The story was quite strange, but the truth behind it was quite obvious to Okin. Aldwin wouldn’t send men after his own son--- would he? It was believable that Previa would have been a bad tail and been detected, but Aldwin could have easily just reprimanded him and the cowardly boy would have turned around with *his* tail between his legs. The stranger thing yet, Aldwin always used Rothars and Devinars to do his bidding--- they couldn’t deny the command of an Impalias. But no Rothars or Devinars wore dark robes or black masks. Was this really the act of someone else? Or maybe just a couple of street robbers? Aldwin’s ‘dissappearance’ was probably just chocked up to Previa’s incompetence, right?

“Thank you for doing as I asked, Previa,” Okin said. “I am shocked and devastated that you were attacked.” Okin’s heart fell. It wasn’t entirely true, Okin had been focused on the implications that this had on The Citadel and how it fit into the mysterious puzzle. Previa’s suffering was an afterthought. Had he been really focusing on the bigger picture, on the greater good, or had he just grown cold? 

Okin shook the thoughts off. No matter what, there *was* something going on here, at the very least he would prevent nepotism that would affect the leadership and future of The Citadel. It was quite ironic that he was using the very person who would suffer by the prevention of said nepotism, to the cause of their own suffering.

*Beneficiary of bias or not, Previa doesn’t deserve this. He’s just an innocent boy, and as he said himself, he never wanted this in the first place. It’s just--- it’s just too important for me to stop now.*

“Did you find anything else, did you see anything suspicious about where your father was headed? Did you find anything?” Okin asked.

Previa looked up in thought, then shook his head. “I do not believe so, Okin. The first area were just some barracks and other Rothar encampments, and the second was just an ordinary Citadel neighbourhood. I’m sorry.”

Okin sighed, slumping back down onto the bed.

“Do I still have to follow father?” Previa asked.

Okin looked to his friend’s eyes, one of which was covered by the bulging black mark.

“No, you can take a break for the next week or two. But please, try to find out more about the Fourth Book of Nexon, and of what Aldwin is doing, and come back to tell me.”

Previa nodded, and Okin got up to lead him out. With slumped shoulders and a drooping head, Previa sauntered out the door. Okin shut the door behind him.

The Ather stumbled forward, collapsing onto the bed again.
