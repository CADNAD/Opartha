“So, you woke up and this thing from your dream was right there in front of you?” Avador sat across from Damian. A dining table---the same type found in Damian’s room---separated the two men. The room was bathed in white light by a small polished sphere which sat at the end of a bronze stand.

Lopping around his chair, Sani--- now dressed in a long coat ---set down a glass of tea. Avador shot her a stiff nod and turned back to the younger man. “And you’ve had nightmares before?” 

“No, none like this. I’ve had nightmares before, but nothing even close to this has ever happened. Has this ever happened to anyone *else*?” Damian’s mouth scrambled over the words in a panic. 

Holding a hand out Avador silenced Damian, but he didn’t speak. Instead, he brought his cup of tea to his mouth. The man sipped at a pace like falling through tar. Somehow the old man always found excuses to waste time. Damian’s lip quivered and he tapped the arm of the chair. In the corner the monster flinched forward.. That alone was enough to help him keep his patience, and he squeezed himself further into the chair’s back.

“Well, nothing as dramatic as that, kid. But I’ve heard of plenty of people making accidental summons.” 

“A summon?” Damian pulled back in shock. “But I’m a Mind herald.” 

Avador chortled, “and not a very good one.” 

Damian was abashed by the statement, and he felt his heart sink a little, but could find no reason to argue with it. He *was* a bad Herald. But he wasn’t much too good at anything, what was one more failed talent?

From the corner of the room, Sani cut in. “He’s a horrid Dark herald and you didn’t even try any other branch?” The woman’s voice, airy and terse carried a mocking tone. 

“Taedon said Hanaata couldn’t even read his spirit. So why in the name of the Forces would I try another branch?” Avador pinched the bride of his nose. 

“Well, he can do Heraldry without a spirit\[ 2021-04-06, 6:09 PM

I changed the line before this, and maybe this one should be changed to, although now it reads more like a joke, which is actually good.\], who knows what else he can do.” 

“Woman,” Avador stared up and Sani shot him back an icy glare.

“Yes, Avador?” 

The older man grunted and looked away. Were married couples supposed to so ? Not that his parents had been perfect either. But they sure were better than this.

“Please, just let me and the kid talk, alright?”  She laughed, but ultimately retreated to the bedroom from which she had so dramatically entered. 

“Kid, let me tell you. Never get married.”  

“I don’t mean to,” Damian said.

“Right, right, I thought the same till one day I didn’t.” Pain stung through Avador’s gaze as his eyes met Damian’s. “But why don’t we see about your new friend?”

Damian bit his lip and turned to face the monster.
