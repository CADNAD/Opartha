A loud knock woke Okin. He scrambled to his feet, straightening out his robe as he dashed to the door. Breslo  was there, his tilted downwards to his feet. He looked up at Okin sheepishly, concern filling his eyes.

“Hello, Okin. I am sorry, I just came to tell you that our gathering has been cancelled. I apologize for bothering you,” Breslo said.

“Cancelled? When will the next meeting be then?” Okin asked.

Breslo gaze fell back to the floor. “It---It is cancelled *indefinitely*.”

“And why would that be?” Okin asked.

“We---,” the older Ather’s eyes darted around. “The other members had a quarrel, and split apart. There is no more group.” After finishing his statement, Breslo stared at Okin intently.

“Okay,” Okin said.  “That is a shame.”

“Yes,” Breslo said. “I must be going now.”

Okin nodded and leaned forward to push the door close.

“Okin. Be careful,” Breslo said, causing Okin to stop closing it midway.

Breslo disappeared down the hall as the door clicked shut.

*That was... rather weird. And infuriating. I had two growing crops which were supposed to ripen today, but they bore no harvest. Now I am back to waddling around aimlessly. No--- I can’t. I won’t have it.*

Okin opened the door again, peeking out to see if Breslo was still in sight. The hallway was clear. He sneaked out, slammed the door close, and ran down the hall as fast as he could.

Stepping out of the visiting complex into the open street, Okin turned both ways. The sun had begun to hide underneath the towering walls of The Citadel. Okin shivered at the approaching darkness. To the right, several hundreds of yards away, was the golden glimmer of Breslo’s robes. 

Okin dashed around crowds, his eyes following Breslo’s path. The other Ather walked with a tense rush, and Okin had to maneuver carefully to keep up without being seen.

*Who was I to rely on Previa? I should have tracked down Aldwin myself.*

Breslo turned down a smaller street, which led to the outer ring of The Citadel. Okin closed in the distance.

Breslo turned again. Looming above the household rooftops was the building which Breslo was likely approaching--- a smaller church near the outskirts of the city.

Okin followed Breslo in short bursts, making sure that there was at least a street’s gap between them, lest he need to hide. Breslo did not turn back however, and continued his determined stride towards the church. 

Now the star of Aredal was all that lit the sky. There was a small graveyard next to the church, and Okin crouched behind one of the houses that was adjacent to it, watching Breslo walk through the graveyard. He opened a double wooden door, and walked into the building.

The church was unguarded; there were no Rothars in sight. Okin began to think about how futile this probably was; Breslo *did* say he was stationed in The Citadel. This was probably just his home church.

Still, why would he turn back now? Maintaining his crouched position, Okin sneaked into the graveyard, following the path that Breslo took. 

Approaching the doors, Okin hid behind the left one leaning over to push the right one open at a snail’s pace. But it was locked. Okin sighed. This had all been for nothing.

He turned away to push himself off the floor, but from inside he heard muffled chatter.

Okin pressed his ear up to the small gap between the two doors. The formerly dampened sounds became clear.

“I told him that the group was disbanded. I never said anything about our purpose or where we meet, or anything of the sort,” a higher-pitched voice said, and Okin recognized it as Breslo.

“You were a fool to invite him in the first place. The harbinger said that he is a threat to our security,” another replied, this one much deeper.

“None of us knew that at the time I invited him. You don’t have to worry, he didn’t seem concerned in the slightest,” Breslo replied.

“Why don’t we just kill him? It would not be difficult,” another voice, this one raspy, responded. Okin shuddered at the proposition, but held his breath so as not to shake the door. 

“The harbinger says that this Ather will not be a problem after the upcoming election, as long as we continue to do our part. We must continue our focus on securing votes,” the deeper voice replied. “The fate of the world rests on our shoulders.”

“Aventa,” a choir of voices said in unison.

There was a brief silence inside the room, just enough for him to hear another sound--- the sound of footsteps approaching. Okin carefully peeked out, his eyes scanning the area. Two Rothars were walking through the graveyard, one with a torch in hand. The armoured soldiers patrolled around the church, approaching Okin’s location. 

He couldn’t run. It would be beyond suspicious, and he would surely be caught by men who trained in combat daily.  The Rothars weren’t heading directly for the entrance, they were just walking around the perimeter that surrounded the church. If Okin ran, he would definitely draw their attention. The only option was to sit still and hope for the best.

Okin shrivelled up, tucking his knees into his arms. The guards turned right, passing a few feet in front of Okin, who sat alone in the darkness. The sound of their boots clicking against the dirt grew louder as they drew nearer. He closed his eyes, as the dim light of the Rothar’s torch passed over his head. 

*Please don’t see me, please don’t see me...*

And heard the sound of clicking boots fade away to his right.

The Rothars hadn’t seen him.

As they turned right again to walk around the side of the property, Okin breathed a deep sigh of relief. They would be back soon, and the strange men inside--- who were all probably his fellow Athers--- didn’t seem like they would hesitate in killing him.

So, Okin ran.
