“The Festival is fun, but those pesks always come in droves during this time. Usually it’s only ones that accidentally fly through the clouds or get close enough to smell the crops, but when *Tehwa Kanura* drops his veil, they all come to feast and peck,” Jerel said to Billy as if he were a tour guide. The other apprentices\[ Replace with Hwasojin? Used in previous chapter\] ignored the two, electing to stick close to Beryl’ instead. Together, they carried a massive stick as tall as three men. Truth be told, Billy wanted to jog ahead and leave Jerel in the dust, but he knew the smiling maniac wouldn’t take the hint.

“Whatever these are\[ Is this the thing they’re hunting?\], wouldn’t they be smart enough to avoid an animal...probably like a billion times their size?” Billy asked. 

“Ah,  I think there comes a point when something becomes too big you just assume it won’t notice you. They’re *mostly* correct about that assumption, though it does apparently make ol’ Kan a bit upset,” Jerel smiled. “Though it does make for some fun hunting.”

Jerel took his rifle off his back, and for once, Billy actually had the urge to ask him something, but he bit his tongue. Likely what could’ve been a one sentence answer about the rifle’s name and specs would inevitably be turned into an essay with Jerel.

“It must’ve been so nice, having really been surrounded by this type of stuff,” Jerel said. “It’s really just me and a couple of others that are interested in the Apathasawian guns. We had to gather up a whole lot of money and do a whole lot of begging just so we could buy a few firearms to share between Beryl’s students. At least he’s not one who believes that this technology is ‘perverting Heraldry’. Though, I do understand where those Dakungs are coming from. I just disagree with them.”

Billy nodded at Jerel showing off the bolt-action, whatever it was\[ Billy would prob know what type of gun it is\]. Billy kept the revolver Beryl had lent him holstered, a standard Karter G410. It wasn’t nearly as elegant as the revolver he had lost in Apathasaw, but it was much more functional then the duelling pistol Allia had given him.

“Ah,” Jerel sighed. “It does really seem that no one else here is interested in Apathasawian culture and technology, despite my efforts, which is such a shame. Maybe you can give me a better perspective, and together we can help them understand.”

Billy stayed silent. Jerel’s eyes twinkled over his own weapon, and he held it out toward Billy, almost showboating, keeping on that excessive smile. Billy blinked---and another smile, kinder, another rifle, older, and another time, happier, strikingly flashed in front of him.

He shuttered away, turning his head to stare at the edges of the wings in the distance. After they had past a few more farms on the backside of the beast, he turned back to Jerel. 

“You know why I really love you guys? It’s the innovative, creative mindset,” Jerel’s mouth changed again, those sparkling green eyes changing to a gentler, light tan, slight wrinkles creasing his face. Though they were walking, he stood still, resting against a dark wood table, leaning down like he was higher than Billy. \[ Not sure what is actually happening here\]

“Apathasaw,” Lionos said\[ Was he talked abt earlier? I dont rememebr\], “is really where our future is headed.”

Billy’s neck jerked, his eyes widening then clamping closed. He stopped in his tracks.

“What is it?” Jerel asked, stopping beside him. “You don’t agree?”

“No, no, just, I---“

“Ah, yeah. It must just seem like the present to you,” Jerel laughed. “Forgot about that. Just like how living on the back of a giant flying monster must seem pretty weird to you, though I’ve gotten pretty used to it.”

Billy nodded, wanting Jerel to shut up for more reasons than one now.

“Wait,” Jerel crouched, his voice quiet yet defined. He leaned down on one leg, bringing the rifle’s sight to his face and aiming it out toward the edges of the beast’s back. Some of the others apprentices just ahead of them stopped, but most, including Beryl himself, continued along the path.

“There’s one,” he shut an eye, adjusting his rifle ever so slightly. Out in the distance, a bird with wings painted with every coloured of the rainbow pecked at the rocky, vermillion back of the beast.

Jerel pulled the trigger. The blast ripped through the air, and the bird flopped over, spreading a pile of red dust.

Jerel pumped a fist in the air, shouting, and the rest of the caravan had already turned to ogle at the gunshot. 

“Sorry, Dakung,” Jerel bowed to his master and the other apprentices. “But I got one! These bullets---they’re faster than the sound of the weapon. Even a Soskatoo has no chance of getting out of the way.”

“I see,” Beryl said, scratching his grey stubble. “Well, if that is the case, I won’t allow you using it during the hunt. No one else has one, so it wouldn’t be a fair fight.”

Jerel’s mouth hung open, but then he regrouped his posture, bowing. Beryl took one of six revolvers from his own bandolier---identical to the one he had lent Billy, and handed it to Jerel.

“Oh no, Dakung, I’ve got my own,” Jerel smiled, unholstering a shiny revolver from his left side. Billy hadn’t even noticed the leather holster till now. 

Billy’s eyes widened at Jerel’s gun. It was *identical* to the one he had lost in Wreathward---a shiny Edgar 38.
