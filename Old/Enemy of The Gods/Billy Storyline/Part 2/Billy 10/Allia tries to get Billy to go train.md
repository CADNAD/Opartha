She closed the door behind her and took a slow look around the place. “You’ve kept it clean?”

“Of course I have, I’m not a cinking slob.” 

Her eyes shot to the empty bottle on the counter, “Of course you’re not. Either way, I didn’t mean it that way.” 

“And what way did you mean it?” 

Allia rolled her eyes, “I simply assumed you’d have bought certain items and personalized the accommodations to suit you more.” 

“Yeah. Sure,” Billy swung open another cupboard door and finally found another bottle of his favourite white liquor. Before his stunted mind could act, his hands instinctively untwisted the cork. 

“Is that...” Allia turned to Billy shocked. “Where did you get that?” She leaned against the kitchen counter, reaching to grab the bottle. Billy jerked his hand away but his drunken state had neutered his reactions. With a twist she wrenched the bottle from his grip, turning her back to him. 

“Cink, what was that for?”  Billy said as he rounded the counter. The audacity, who the hell did she think she was? 

“In the name of the Forces, where did you even get this?” Her hair nearly whipped Billy in his face as she turned, pointing to a caligraphic symbol on the bottom of the bottle. “Forces only know how you get enough money to buy this.” 

Billy shrugged, “Damian and Benjamin have been bringing them back for me every day or two.” 

“Day or two!” Her mouth and eyes were wide. Deep lines furrowed her brow as she narrowed her eyes. “You don’t even know what this is, do you?” 

“No idea,” Billy said. He could feel a smile tug at his lips, he revelled in Allia’s temper. Her fists were clenched, and her jaw was so tense he thought he may have cut himself on it. 

“*Xizhong Nejha,*” Allia muttered in a foreign langue. “I really can’t believe you.” 

“Well you better, I’m cinking here after all, aren’t I?” Billy took a step towards her backing the women into the kitchen counter. 

Allia made a small tutting sound, “and what have you done? You stay in your room all day, and for what? Benjamin and Damian are both *trying*, but you sit here wallowing in self pity. I thought I would come and find a reason for your absence, but you can’t even conjure a proper excuse. Can you?”   

Looking up at him, her face was emblazoned with smug defiance. He had seen the face on gamblers before, right before he would clear them out. 

“Listen, I know everyone here’s probably sucked you off your whole life but I ain’t here to do that. You think you’re so smart just cause you’ve got Damian wrapped tight around your fingers, but I’m here to tell you you’re not. But I know him, he’s too smart for you. What did you promise him?” Billy dug a finger against her ribs, forcing Allia to take a sharp breath. “*Your body*? Whatever it is I know it won’t last for long.”  

“You really want to do this?” Allia asks. Slowly her eyes begin to glow, her veins pulsing white under her skin. Billy pushed in further, rolling his knuckle up her side. Holding his gaze with a steeling calm, Allia slowly pulled away his hand. She rolled his fingers apart, and slowly pushed them back to the point of breaking. Through the alcohol he could only feel the faintest idea of pain. 

“Maybe,” she began slowly. “I’ve simply given him a purpose to life. Something besides cleaning up after an old drunkard. Do you think he’s proud of you? I imagine you do. After all, you want Damian to be able to look up to you. But you know he can’t so you’re going to drink yourself away to forget. To forget how I’m replacing you.”

Billy stumbled back wrenching his hand from Allia’s grip, feeling a faint popping as he did. “You’d like to imagine yourself as a genius, the saviour in shining armour. But not even Damian sees you as that.”  

Billy threw a punch at Allia’s jaw. His hand glanced past she twisted past, ducking her his hand she rushed his body. The woman’s hands wrapped around his waist, before twisting him to the ground. Slamming the ground, Billy gasped for air. 

Before Billy could push himself up a boot forced him back to the ground. Allia stared down at him, her eyes disgusted behind a scrunched nose, Slowly the glow faded from and all that was left was an annoyed young woman.

“For austerity’s sake I didn’t intend to come here and mince words,” digging into a pocket in her side she produced a wooden box two hands tall. “Rather I intended to come and extend my proverbial olive branch.” She turned the box over in her hands. Apathasawin writing ringed the top. It was a item code, the company name, date of manufacturing, date of sealing, material information, and patent code. Whatever was in the box was made nearly a decade ago.

Allia drew her lips to a thin line. “It’s yours, feel free to do with it as you see fit. If you can even open the box in your state.” 

She slid along the counter, making her way to the door. Billy snapped the box up, sliding his hands over the perfectly cut wood. He thumbed a divet where the latch should have been, but the box refused to open itself.

“Billy,” Allia stood in the doorway, her head turned over her shoulder. “If you care about Damian, start acting like it. *Xizhong Nejha.”*  

The door slammed behind her. The words hung over Billy, the venom in her foreign insult snaking its way his veins. *That bitch*, he slammed the box against the kitchen counter. Splinters of wood flew in mist, the box splitting in half like a ship caught between two waves. Inside, red velvet lined the box cushioning a silver pistol. Loose bullets spilled across the floor and around Billy’s feet. Swaddled in red, the gun seemed to mock him. *You need me,* it said. *You need Allia’s gifts.* 

Cink that, he didn’t need anything she thought he did. He bent over to snatch the gun up. Underneath the item itself was a small hand written note. The hand writing was eerily consistent, but not perfect. Holding the note in one hand, and the pistol in his other he slowly parsed the writing. 

“I feel I owe a debt to you, since we were not able to recover your belongings. Damian has expressed great praise in regard to your sharpshooting capabilites.” The note said. “I hope to one day witness this talent myself. May my gift bring you as much fortune as the gifts of the Forces have brought me.”

*Like this piece of junk makes up for what I lost back in Metheno,* he thinks to himself. It was single shot, not even clip fed, and certainly not a cutting edge revolver. He’d have had to sell at least thirty, no *fifty* of these to get his hands on a proper revolver. But it was polished. A box this old, the pistol would probably have been greasier then a pubescent teen’s face. Turning to look down the barrel he found it cleaned, albeit shoddily. And after all, it was a gun. One which fired proper bullet, however old. But it was the wrong caliber, much lighter than he was used to shooting. He wouldn’t be able to hit anything with this. 

Turning the pistol over he noticed the model number, stamped on its hilt. It was the same model he had first bought when arriving in Aparthasaw. It was just a coincidence, it had to be. But finding one of these nowadays would be a gruelling task. Cink, these things probably cost as much his lost revolver had. 

In the empty room. Billy laughed. A small chuckle then a roaring laughter. “That bitch got scammed!”
