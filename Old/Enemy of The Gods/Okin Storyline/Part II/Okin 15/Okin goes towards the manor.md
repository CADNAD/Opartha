Okin stepped up out of the bunker and closed the hatch. Besides the normal that the rooftops cast over Ateon’s alleyway, the day was decently bright, at least for overcast. The clouds seemed to rarely disappear over Nairfalk.

To his surprise, the corpse of the assassin was nowhere to be seen in the small crack between the two houses where Ateon resided. 

“Where’d---“

“I disposed of it while you were asleep. In fact, you woke up almost right when I got back,” Ateon interjected.

Okin nodded and stepped over the pile of blankets that were previously used to cover the body. The image of the knife in the assassin’s neck flashed in his mind, and he cringed.

“I took these off the body first, though. And I washed the clothes as best as I could,” Ateon’s beard twitched, and Okin guessed it was a scowl.

Okin’s expression of disgust grew--- he realized he might eventually have to *wear* the clothes the assassin *died* in. 

“Here,” Ateon reached out a wrinkly hand. On it were four of those dull grey cast-iron rings. Okin placed them in his satchel, next to the beaked mask. He wasn’t able to completely close the bag as usual, and instead just hid the tip of the beak with the bag’s cover. 

“Go on now,” Ateon motioned towards the exit of the alley. “I must attend to something, but meet me back here afterwards. If you are not back in time, I will go looking for you.

“Ensure you are careful, and be wary of any Rothars or Athers who are eyeing you suspiciously. If it feels dangerous, get out of there. Information is not worth anything if you are dead or captured.”

Okin shivered. He sometimes couldn’t comprehend how it was for someone to want him *dead.* It felt like his skin was constricting his innards. 

*Better not to think about it all.*

“And do not speak to *anybody* unless spoken to*,”* Ateon’s eyebrows narrowed, and he drove a finger into Okin’s chest. Okin found his eyes glued to Ateon’s, and he listened to him unlike he had listened to anyone else before. 

“If you find someone you know, do everything you can to avoid them without looking suspicious. No one else can know of this. You can *never* be sure who is part of this cult. You cannot trust *anyone*, Okin. I still do not think this is a good idea, but if you insist, go on. But you must merely be a set of eyes and ears.”

There was a long pause. Ateon stopped and stepped back, ending his parental stare. 

Okin gave a determined nod to Ateon. The former Ather returned one. Despite that they were two dirty men in the darkest, poorest part of The Citadel, in that moment, they were two soldiers making a last stand against the corrupt enemy. 

Okin slung his satchel back over his shoulder and made off onto the streets of the walled city.
