* Guidelines for this doc format
- For **, this means that this key beat occurs, and then
  everything grouped after it is all the beats/scenes that occur after it until the next beat begins. e.g: ** Midpoint will start with the first crucial beat (the midpoint itself), which are additionally marked with ! as a prefix, and then scenes which follow after. This is why Break into X is in Act X.
