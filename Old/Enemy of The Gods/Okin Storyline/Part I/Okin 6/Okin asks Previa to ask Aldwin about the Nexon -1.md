The warm rays of Aredal peeked through the curtains, and Okin’s head rolled away from them. 

His neck was stiff, and he felt hunched over. There was a warm, homely, yet strong smell--- it could not be mistaken. Though his body was in pain, he woke up with a smile and his vision faded into view. 

His world was tilted over, the he viewed the candle from the base-up. His head jerked up, and pages rustled. He looked down--- he realized he had opened 

He breathed a sigh of relief--- the candle had been lit, but he must’ve blown it out before falling asleep, as there was still plenty of wick remaining.

Still, the scent had remained until morning. He smiled--- it truly was a gift from the Gods. He closed his eyes, inhaled and lifted his head again in an attempt to consume all the scented air.

Never would he thought the warm of Aredal’s Light could be present in a smell. Like the fire that ignited it, it was warm yet bold. It was the courage of common men.

Below him, the page the vagrant had given him was on the desk. He did not remember reading any of it. Still, he had the intense desire to find the Truths within.

He tugged open the curtains, and a pool of light flooded into the room. 

He began reading closely. Aredal, it was messy---and by the Four, it was in Terridian! Even though Okin was more adept in the language than many of his peers, it still took a while to get going. Translating it though--- it was in a way more thrilling then if it was just in ordinary Trentanian, and he felt his heart pumping.

His excitement was broken by a loud knock from the door. Okin looked back down to the page, but the knocking came again, louder this time.

He sighed. Had Gendro finally waken, or was it just one of the Istars who attended to the rooms?

*Only one way to find out,* he thought before folding the paper neatly until the entire thing could fit in the palm of his hand.

“Okin,” the eager blue eyes of Previa surprised him behind the now-open door. The young Ather wore a navy nobleman’s coat, studded with faux gold buttons and matching engravings, and white cut pants. His outfits were seeming less and less Ather-like since Okin’s arrival at The Citadel.  “How’d you sleep?”

“I---not so well,” Okin’s leg shook as he moved his paper-clutching hand behind it.

“That’s unfortunate,” Previa stepped into the room, and Okin turned so his back was away from the younger Ather.  “You never told me how long you were staying, but I guessed it couldn’t be long if you aren’t strengthening your Dedication.”

Okin nodded; truth be told, he didn’t know what to tell his friend. Besides, the less the babbling Ather knew, the better. 

“So, why have you come by Previa?  Aren’t you busy preparing for the election with your father?”

Previa shook his head.  “Nope, father had to go to The Seat of The Mouth of The Gods today. Thank Aredal, I couldn’t stand another second of discussing the opinions of Athers and High Athers I’ve never met.” The younger man stepped into the room, sitting down on the bed. “It must be a paradise, not having your father puppeteering over you.”

*Ah, at least he understands his role more than I assumed.* It was almost certain that Aldwin was pushing Previa to run so that he would have more effective power in The Citadel.  Okin wanted to believe otherwise--- Aldwin was a good man, but what other explanation was there? Previa’s innocence and jolliness hid the fact that he was almost certainly a victim of manipulation. 

“Previa--- do you think you could ask Impalias Aldwin something for me?”

“Well, yes, I think I can,” Previa smiled.

Okin nodded. “Could you ask your father--- and make sure to remember this, and word it the same way I tell you--- if he has ever heard of the *Fourth Book of Nexon*?”

Previa looked to the side,  re-mouthing Okin’s question to himself.  “Yes, I will ask him when I see him next, if he has ever heard of the Fourth Book of Nexon.”

The young Ather didn’t even raise an eyebrow at Okin’s strange request. Was it possible that Previa thought the Fourth Book was just a normal inclusion in the Versalist texts? If *any* Ather that served The Citadel didn’t know that there were only three Books of Nexon, it was Previa, but still, most of the children back in Metheno could name all the books of the Four.

“Why don’t you just ask him yourself?  We both know that father is very fond of you,” Previa said, looking up to Okin. 

The High Ather looked to the floor, avoiding Previa’s gaze. He needed to find the Truth here--- if the vagrant’s allegations were true, it was his duty as an Ather. But how could he tell the boy the Truth and still receive the Truth from Aldwin?

“I-I believe he will not give me a complete, careful answer,” Okin said. “But he would put thought and effort if asked by his own son.” 

Okin repeated what he said in his head. Yes, it was true. He smiled to himself.

Okin checked the young Ather’s reaction. His smile indicated he was probably convinced by Okin’s argument. After all, it *was* the Truth, and only the deceitful were repulsed by the Truth.

“All right, I’ll do it.  I don’t like...hiding things from father very much, though. I feel he can smell it,” Previa said. 

*It pains me to do this as well. I ask for your forgiveness if I have done any wrongs, Lord Aredal, and hopefully this is the path you have chosen. It feels as though I have forsaken Truth... but yet, in another sense, I am standing for it, and for the other tenants which you hold dear. Something is being hidden, a distortion of the Truth, and I must break my own record of perfection in order to reveal it. Isn’t that what you would do? Sacrifice your greatest asset for the good of the people?*

“It is not so much hiding something,” Okin said. “You are merely passing on an inquiry from me to your father. But--- please don’t tell him that it was from me.”

Previa raised an eyebrow. “This--- this doesn’t seem like you, Okin.”

Okin sighed, resting his arm around Previa’s back. “Yes, I am caught in a very tough dilemma at the moment. It will all make sense soon, but know that together we’ll do what it takes to serve our Lord Aredal. And look,” Okin smiled and pulled his friend closer. 

“I was right! You were given an opportunity to show your Bravery, and to stand for Truth and Justice,” Okin patted his friend’s shoulder like a proud father.

“I guess that’s true,” Previa laughed. “When I came here, I thought *maybe* I’d become a High Ather, and now I’m running for Impalias. It... it kind of feels like too much, though, Okin.”

*Even Previa can sense his own inadequacy*, Okin thought. Hopefully, even with Aldwin’s backing, Previa’s incompetence would be clear. Okin trusted the intelligence of his fellow Athers, except for Previa, of course. The young boy was too impressionable--- even Okin had been able to manipulate him easily.

*Yes, I have just manipulated him. The lad trusts me like a younger brother--- and yet I use his naivety to further my own goals. This... this is the trickery of the likes of Deionis and Tregale.*

“I---,” Okin turned away from Previa, facing the empty wall.  “I am sorry, Previa, I have much to prepare for. Please come back tomorrow morning.” 

“Oh--- I’m sorry for bothering you, I forgot that you might be actually doing something important,” Previa laughed. “I’ll come by and see you tomorrow, and tell you anything father tells me.”

The young Ather sat up from the bed, trudging past Okin with a wide smile.  Okin closed the door behind him, and then fell to his knees, praying for forgiveness from his God.
