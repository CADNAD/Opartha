“They’ll avoid being\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-22 1:29 PM  
Make Nexon’s attacks and fighting style more impromptu and wacky--- throwing hats, cartwheels, etc.\] pulled off into the current, but they also can’t get *too* close to the coast.  We can use that to close in and cut them off,” Kiatus shouted. “It’s just another regular raid, men!”

Kiatus zoomed around, the sails pitching back and forth after his stops. Was he really controlling this entire ship by himself?

Facing the trade ship, a heavyset man juggled smaller cannonballs, none of them actually touching his hands. He shot out one at the enemy ship, but it bulleted way *over* the trade ship. Two other pirates lined up adjacent to him and started doing the same, aiming for up high.

One of the balls hit the cloth of the flag, causing it to whip around the pole. “Ohh!” The three men yelled. The other two dropped their balls, each giving the fat one a high five.

Billy raised an eyebrow. Three Heralds could probably take down a ship of that size, but instead relegated to playing some weird game while the others prepared for assault?

Billy glanced around. The rest of the crew was still sitting at the tables, drinking and talking while their ship approached the trade caravan.

Kiatus was really the only one dashing around with a smile, even climbing the ship’s mast in a blink of an eye and looking out with a wooden monocular.

He whooshed past Billy, lining up next where the three men had been throwing cannonballs at the front port side of the ship. 

“In fact, it’s almost too regular,” Kiatus sighed. “Not really anything exciting about this one.”

“Well,” he faced the rest of the crew. “I guess, as usual we make our own fun. The rest of you!” He shouted to the back of the ship. “No Heraldry, and no shooting at the enemy. Understand?”

The men nodded, returning back to their business of consumption and playing cards, a few light groans echoing among them.

“Oh, and Billy!” Kiatus smiled. “Follow me.”

Kiatus walked to the very front of the ship, motioning for Billy to follow. He reached into the pocket of his crimson  vest, and pulled out a glowing, green crystal. A Time Crystal, much larger than most.

“Here, take this,” Kiatus said, and Billy put the crystal in his pant pocket. “And, you know what? This too.”

The Captain held back his black jacket, and pulled a revolver out of a holster. He flipped it up and held out the handle for Billy.

Hand shaking, Billy grabbed the pearly white grip. It was *beautiful*---it belonged under the deck in Kiatus’ collection of pristine artifacts, with that dark steel finish which contrasted beautifully with its handle. He didn’t recognize the model, which was rare, considering the fact that there weren’t *that* many brands of revolvers. There definitely weren’t any with a barrel that long.

He held it tight, admiring it side, and he couldn’t control the glimmer in his eyes. Kiatus smiled---and then in true fashion, leaped off the front of the ship.

Billy holstered the revolver and clutched the side of the rail, peering his neck over. Kiatus stood just below---he stood on the *water,* waving at Billy. His body vibrated horizontally over the waves.

“Slow Time!” Kiatus shouted. “I will help you! There’s nothing to be afraid of!”

Closing his eyes, Billy did as instructed. When he opened them, the waves that were once so violent their shapes were indistinguishable became a slower scene, almost like moving, blue hills.

“Ah, good!” Kiatus said. The Captain’s form was finally *definable* with Time slowed, but he still did a quick dance of stepping side to side. Billy’s eyebrow gradually raised. He’d never been able to talk while slowing Time, or move his legs---he could only sort of *load* movements, but Kiatus seemed to be doing it with ease. “This won’t be nearly enough, though, of course, because it’s only one side of the coin. It’s been a while since I’ve done this, Billy, please forgive me.”

Kiatus reached a hand up to Billy and closed his eyes. A strange wave, like thousands of pinpricks, rushed across Billy’s skin, and the crystal shook within his pocket. His surroundings froze to almost a complete halt, he was now looking at a massive, three-dimensional painting of the waters. 

And he could *move.*

“Oh good, it works,” Kiatus smiled. The Captain was now walking at a normal pace on the water, but his feet still barely touched the surface. “Come down Billy. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

Shivering, Billy closed his eyes, and threw himself over the rail of the ship. 

His feet cooled, and his legs splashed down into the water. He opened his eyes in a panic, and scrambled every limb in an upwards circle. How could anyone balance on water?

His swinging hand caught onto an arm, and Kiatus smiled, pulling him upwards, and for a second, Billy’s body was completely in the air again. 

“Keep moving,” Kiatus said. “And believe.”

Billy fell back down into a jog, and found himself running on the water. He found it impossible not to drop his jaw in awe as he crested over and through the still waves, creating a foamy gap where his legs and feet sliced through.

“Come on!” Kiatus shouted, running off towards the hull of one of the ships they were targeting in the raid. Billy followed, stomping through the waves, a large grin on his face.

Kiatus ran up the side of the trade ship. He reached one hand to a large iron ring and swung up the side, then clutched a gap in the ship’s rail and pulled himself up over it	. Billy followed suit, though he needed Kiatus’ help to pull him up onto the deck.

The men were statues, pointing at Kiatus’ fleet, mouths hung open, stuck with red faces of true desperation while pulling with all their might on the sails or hurriedly stuffing cannons. If he truly looked closely, Billy could see their spit flying in the air, their arms and legs moving at the pace of a tortoise stuck in the mud. 

“Don’t be afraid,” Kiatus said. “To them, you’ll just be a blur. Look.”

The captain waved his hands in front of the face of a bearded sailor with a red bandana. The man didn’t move an inch. Kiatus slapped the man across the cheek, and his face scrunched up, following the path of Kiatus’ hand, but freezing in mid-air after that, his whole body slowly twisting and plummeting into the deck.

Billy’s jaw dropped. How fast were they moving? Even a slap like that could absolutely destroy someone at these speeds!\[ And sound of bone breaking?\]

“Ah, this is too much, as always,” Kiatus groaned. “It’s not fun.”

Like that, the surroundings hurtled into normal speeds. The waves crashed against each other, rocking the boat, the white-clothed men yelled and pointed and dashed and lit cannons, and the one sailor Kiatus had punched crashed into the deck. \[ Maybe more force here\]

Men turned at the crash, faces flaring with rage and shock upon seeing the intruders. They grabbed for their belts, whipping out swords and daggers, and charged for the men. Billy stumbled backwards and reached for his holster.  After all that, he now felt that he had no time to react, his fingers desperately scrambled for the sleek weapon. He dug into his mind and slowed Time himself--- but now, his powers seemed insignificant. His feet were all but planted, and he was almost fully limited to observing and planning. The edge that he once prided himself over others now seemed like *nothing* after experiencing what Kiatus had given him for a few moments.

And like that, his prayers were answered. The crystal in his pocket vibrated again, and the two men sprinting at him now looked like they were taking giant steps through a vat of honey. 

Still, it was not nearly as slow as before. The sailor raised his sword, preparing a downward strike at Billy, but the outlaw did a flip with his gun, closed an eye, and fired a beautiful bullet straight at the man’s rising hand. 

It was still slow enough that Billy could actually *see t*he bullet, which was still dozens of times faster than him sprinting at this speed. It ripped a perfect circle right through the man’s hand, blowing blood through the air before continuing out into the open skies. A moment later, the muted sound of gushing blood filled his ears.\[ Might have made this too graphic\]

Billy lowered his gun and took aim at the hand of the other approaching attacker, who readied a low stab at Billy’s legs. The other man had bitten his lip, and his sword was dropping mid-air as he pulled in his desolated palm in agony. The sound of his screams were a prolonged and distorted ringing at this speed.

*Boom*. Billy pulled the trigger, the gun recoiled backwards, a bright spark lit up at the end of the barrel and another silver bullet went flying, brutalizing the man’s fingers and knocking the handle of the knife out of his hands.

Then it all stopped, he blinked, and in front of him were two fallen sailors, their white uniforms splattered with blood, both screaming in agony while clutching their demolished hands.

Billy looked to Kiatus, who was being pounced on by the majority of the crew that wasn’t swearing at the sails or shooting out commands and cannonballs. The Captain cartwheeled around the strikes of a pirate, then did a flip in the air, and then another; this one ending in a brutal slam of his back and the deck. Billy cringed, but Kiatus immediately sat up and laughed, sweeping his leg into the lone foot of a sailor who sprinted at him with a dagger in hand. The Captain narrowly moved his torso out of the way of the falling man and the sharp edge, which both hit the deck face-first.

*What is this guy doing?*  Kiatus could easily just slow Time enough and rob the ship of all its gold, or at least make this brawl he started *easier*, but yet he was running the risk of getting killed by ordinary sailors?

The Captain stood up, wiping his sweaty brow, and then became a whirlwind. Billy’s eyes darted back and forth focused to Kiatus’ blurry form, which zig-zagged between the attackers---or, now, some fleers, and some who just stood with shaky blades outstretched at the tornado before them.

*This* was how men saw Kiatus, and now Billy knew that this was just him on lazy mode. Men fell to the ground and bones cracked against the deck. Some tried to enter the whirlwind, and fittingly were blown away, thrown with unrelenting force off the sides of the ship and into the wild waters.

Before long, all the 

The sensation of pricked skin washed over him again, and his surroundings grinned to a complete halt. 

“Well, that was fun, wasn’t it?” Kiatus brushed away his silky golden hair and shook blood off his fist. Billy couldn’t manage a word, only a frozen gawk. “Well, to be honest, yes, I’m tired of it too after the thousandth time. But, well, I try to make my own fun. If any of these scoundrels try to lunge at you, well, I’m sure you’ve got enough bullets to take care of yourself while I---eh, nah, I’ll let the rest of them take it down, don’t want to make them feel useless.”

Kiatus flashed his pearly teeth, and then zoomed around the boat. The sails jerked back and forth, almost anchoring the ship against the current while. Kiatus’ flagship approached. Two of the other ships had already passed ahead and were shooting cannonballs, spears, balls of fire, and even plumes of water from the sea at the two other fleeing trade ships.

Kiatus’ ship dwarfed the trade vessel; the whipping black flag atop the armada of sails created a towering shadow over Billy and the downed sailors and he briefly felt a hint of primal fear as Kiatus’ crew crashed down makeshift bridges over gap.

The buckled boots stormed across the narrow planks, men almost falling from the shaking of the ships between the current, being caught by a pirate who stood at the end of every bridge, re-balancing those who would teeter off with Space Heraldry. Kiatus paused his back-and-forth to exchange salutes with his men, a wide grin on his face.

The sailors whimpered as men plucked gold, crates, and booze from ship. Billy holstered his revolver and followed the pirates back onto Kiatus’ boat. There was a sharp gust of wind and Kiatus himself appeared behind Billy in the line like an eager child waiting for food. The men stomped back over the bridges and began dismounting them from the enemy ship.
