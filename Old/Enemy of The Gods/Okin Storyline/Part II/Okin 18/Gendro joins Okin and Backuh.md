“Okin? Okin?” A voice grew loud, then quiet, then loud again. Loud footsteps smacked against the concrete.

Ateon pulled him back, and the two of them crouched in the shadows.

Okin’s mouth widened. He recognized the voice--- it was *Gendro.*

He could see a fuzzy blur and shadow pass over in the very corner of his eye. 

Okin shut his eyes. His legs shook. 

“Okin? Are you here?” Gendro shouted. “Ateon?”

Okin grimaced. He just *couldn’t* stay hidden anymore. This was *not* what Aredal taught.

And so, he stood to his feet and brushed off his robe. He took one step forward. His face was basked in the dim sun, but his back was still covered by the shadow of the rooftops. Gendro had just come to where the street intersected with the small opening between the houses.

“Hello, Gendro,” Okin said.

The Rothar was donned in full steel armour, beside a faceplate or helm. He looked utterly surprised at Okin’s announcement.

The shock in his eyes quickly narrowed into anger.

“Okin--- you’ve been--- you’ve been *here* this whole time?” He shouted.

“I--- I can explain,” Okin said. “I---“

“You didn’t tell me anything, Okin!” Gendro took an aggressive step toward Okin, and the High Ather took one back into the shadows. “I thought you were dead!”

“I---,” sweat fell down Okin’s forehead. He felt a bit guilty about leaving Gendro, but it *had* to be done. He had done it for the man’s safety and for the safety of the mission.

But faced down with the metal finger of Gendro’s gauntlet at his chest, a word of rationale wouldn’t leave Okin’s lips.

“It’s not his fault,” Okin’s neck turned to Ateon who was still entirely covered by shade. Gendro fell back into a fighting stance.

The deserted Ather \[ 2022-01-24, 3:33 PM

Check if this make sense\]stepped forward, arms raised in surrender. Gendro’s posture relaxed--- but his face only grew in anger.

“You! It was *you*!” Gendro snarled at Ateon. He shoved forward, reaching an armoured hand to Ateon’s chest.

But Okin threw a hand in his way.

The Rothar glanced to Okin with slanted eyebrows.

“Gendro, I’m sorry. I wouldn’t have done this if I had any other choice. They sent a man to *kill* me, Gendro. I thought it wasn’t safe,” Okin said. 

The Rothar’s aggressive stance fell, and his eyes relaxed a bit.

“Maybe we are in over our head, Okin,” he said. “Gods, this is The Citadel! It’s supposed to be the safest city in the world, not some dangerous, shadowy urban hellhole\[ 2022-01-24, 3:41 PM

Maybe too modern?\]! Maybe--- maybe this isn’t our fight.”

Gendro placed a gauntleted hand on Okin’s shoulder. The High Ather’s head fell. 

*I--- I always looked to the Onorun for your guidance, my Gods. But now--- now it seems that even that has come under question. Is Gendro right, and should we look for others more capable to fight this Darkness? Or you have me be Brave and face this---*

“If no one stands up and takes Justice into their own hands,” Ateon placed a firm hand on Okin’s shoulder, “If no one is *Brave* enough to fight the Darkness even when the odds seemed stacked against them--- then evil and corruption will *never* be vanquished.”

“Easy for you to stay! You stay out here hiding in the shadows all day!” Gendro shouted. “Okin is an Ather! Okin was *almost killed!* How long have *you* known about this Fourth Book of Nexon? And you’ve done nothing!”

Okin bit his lip. If only Gendro knew that Ateon was an Ather too, that he had been casted aside and forced to live as a vagrant *because* he had tried to do something. Okin was always honest--- but did he have the right to tell Gendro about Truths which were vital secrets to Ateon’s---

\]“I--- You are right. I have not done enough,” Ateon said. “But--- I *am* dedicated to this fight. I was--- I was also an Ather, too.”

The vagrant rolled down a long, scruffy sleeve and exposed the palm of his hand to Gendro. It was still dark and the Rothar had to lean down to see it. But his eyes widened as he saw the golden marks on the man’s palm.

“I like to think I still am one. Rothars and Athers are supposed to be lifelong. I am just taking--- a forced hiatus,” the edges of Ateon’s beard curved upwards.

Gendro held a gauntleted hand to his face. He turned around with a distraught expression in his eyes.

“I---I had no idea,” Gendro said. “How long have you been... like this?”

The former Ather shrugged. “Definitely less than a century, but more than a year. But how many? Who knows?”

Gendro shook his head, and Ateon placed a hand on the Rothar’s shoulder. 

“The important thing is that it all may be finally coming to an end, *if* we march our men right. I think it’s time that we all work together. What do you say?”

Gendro looked down to the vagrant’s wrinkly hand in the Darkness. He shoved it off and turned around so his armour shone under the dim sunlight.

\[2022-02-08, 11:10 PM

Add more conflict here\]“Well--- as long as we promise to stick to our Values--- I’m in.”

Ateon smiled and gave a triumphant nod, and Okin couldn’t help to as well.

“But Okin,” Gendro jammed a metal finger at Okin’s chest. His shimmering green eyes darkened into a serious stare. “No more lies.”

“I-I-I---,” Okin stammered. “I didn’t---“

Okin’s eyes fell as he remembered one of the most widely-known quotes from the Onorun.

*Aredal 1:15: To oppose Truth is not just to speak outright lies. Witholding information for the sake of one’s status or reputation, twisting the tongue to use the words of Truth but the essence of Deception, blocking the eyes, ears or mind from Knowledge which reveals Truth, this is all Deception.* 

He grimaced. 

“I---I’m sorry, Gendro,” he shook his head. 

“It’s alright, Okin,” Gendro said. “I am your Rothar, through and through. I just don’t want you to do something you’ll regret. I don’t want you to do something that’s not really you, in the name of all this. And most importantly I want to keep you safe.”

Okin nodded. Gendro gave a toothy smile, and Okin returned a softer one.

“Well, I discovered three men who are definitely members of the cult and I’m going after them. If you’d like to come---

“I think that now that we are all working together, we should divide and conquer,” Ateon interrupted. “You have your leads and can follow them, and Gendro and I can focus on researching the missing texts and getting the necessary information to the public. And remember, Okin, you are supposed to stay stealthy and hidden. That becomes exponentially harder the more people you have around you.”

Okin grimaced. He had plans in his head, but how was he supposed to execute them when he would be executed for them?

“Is that all right with you, Gendro?” Ateon looked to the Rothar.

“Yeah, as long as we are all working together and in an honest manner,” Gendro smiled.

“Of course,” Ateon returned one. The former Ather placed a hand on each of the clergymen’s shoulders.

“Now let us go, and find the Truth. There is no time to waste.”
