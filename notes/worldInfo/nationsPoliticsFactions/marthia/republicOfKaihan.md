# Kaihan Da Sheen (Republic of Kaihan)

# Environment
## Terrain

The Republic of Kaihan is based primarily in lake Sikan (home lake). The name stems from a misunderstanding between the original Trentanian explores and the locals, as those in the republic call it simply Ti Si. A deep water bay, surrounded by lagoons it provides a good bay for ships to moor.

# Population
## Ethnic Groups

The republic contains citizens of all nations around the word. But there are three primary ethnic groups native to the lake. The *Tillhan* in the north, the *Hansi* in the island lakes and the costal *Disi*. There are little notable exceptions in the appearance between them. They all share hazel toned hair, light brown skin, and dull blue eyes. Though the Tillhan tend to have more grey eyes.

## Language

The Kaihan speak *Ree Da Sai* more commonly known as simply *Sai*. Sai is a creole of the languages from around lake Kaisi. Originally used to communicate amongst crews from disparate towns, it has now developed into its own language. Many now grow up speaking primarily Ree Da Sai.

Subject --> adjectives --> verbs --> adverbs --> Object

As Hansi and Tillhan share similar grammatical structures Sai has taken mostly from those two. However, words such as Sheen take trace their roots back to Disi. There are other notable borrowed words in Sai, such as the their words for Heralds. Elemental Heralds were catergorized early and are called by their native names. Due to the lower frequency of all other Heraldry it was not until contact with the early Delmian traders that the words for all other schools of Heraldry entered into the Sai vocabulary. 

The writing system used is comprised of half drawn blocks and dots. Each column of a word represents a sound. They are connected by both context and the placements of dots. 

## Taboos and Customs

The most important moment in a person's life is the moment they commit to their Sheehan or crew. These pledges are expected to be for life. Breaking from this pledge to join another Sheehan marks one as an outcast and entrust worthy. Most Sheehan will not take one marked as such, leaving them to work menial labour on land. 

A perspective member must meet the requirements set out by the Sheehan and be accepted by each ships captain specifically. The requirements differ from group to group but typically consist of a minimum number of voyages or year of services, and a set of feats.

# Society

All citizens in the republic belong to Sheehan. Most Sheehan operate between 1-3 ships, with only one being a deep water galleon. Some Sheehan operate exclusively within the republic and make a majority of their profits from on shore business and transactions. These logistical Sheehan are mostly been bought out or integrated into larger Sheehan. Those select few Sheehan that operate multiple long range, deep water ships, typically operate upwards of 15 of these larger vessels. 

## Government Type

Any captain of a ship is permitted entry into the Helhan or Assembly of Captains. Each captain gets one vote, though some Sheehan have multiple captains. This largest body is used to elect a smaller body of 60 senators. Each senator serves for a term of 10 years, staggered so six are newly elected per cycle. The senate holds nominal power, though multiple smaller subcommittees are created and dissolved as needed. Above them is the Kailev, a single elected figure who serves as a tie breaker and foreign dignitary. In times of crisis the Kailev can be granted emergency powers. 

The Helhan is held four times per year. The first session is primarily for senatorial elections. Any members of the Helhan may speak up to nominate themselves or any others. A captain may only be nominated every other year. Once all nominations are heard, each captain is casts a single vote. The most popular name is passed, and the process repeats till six senate members are confirmed. If subcommittee members are required to be assigned, the Senate presents a list of ranked candidates. A subcommittee nomination is confirmed if less than 30% of present captain object. 

#### Special Subcommittees

**The Council of Tides**: (This is a reference so maybe we need to change it) Members of this council govern the direction and strength of the current produced by the Water Heralds in the bay. They are also in charge of approving and arranging the docking of all ships entering Kaihan.



## Religion and Philosophy

The primary religion is that of Levtav. They worship the Leviathi and read the current it creates in the straight as a form of divination.
