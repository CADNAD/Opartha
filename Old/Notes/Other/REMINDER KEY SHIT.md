Beasts are attracted to Damian because he’s Tregale!

Delmians have artifact!

Okin is secretly dark herald!

Nexon was originally on Tregale’s side, but after the death of his brother betrayed Tregale, winning the war. Revictus and the ‘editors’ changed the bible afterwards that Nexon was always on Almighty’s side.

Secrets of the Editors: 

\-Nexon started on Tregale’s side

\-Some of the Gods are still alive

\-The rest of Almighty’s Gods execute the Tregale’s remaining Gods

\-The existence and use of the Golden weapons

\-One of The Gods on Almighty’s side was a Dark Herald

\-One of Justin’s spies joins Revictus’ cult

Revictus knows Tregale will summon himself back to Earth through a host, as he has tried many times before and Almighty told Revictus so. Revictus then encourages the killing of Dark Heralds so that Tregale can’t summon himself back to Earth. Revictus wants to go to war with Farsun again so that all the Dark Heralds will be eliminated.

After Revictus’ death Deionis impersonates Revictus

Location of Artifacts:
