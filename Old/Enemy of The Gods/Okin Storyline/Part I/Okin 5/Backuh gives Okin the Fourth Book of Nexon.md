“Where are we going?” Okin pulled on the beggar’s shoulder. The sky was so dark now that no one dared to walk the streets, even with a torch. The thought that he was even up at this hour made him shiver.

“To my home. That is where the text is,” the beggar said.

“I thought you said you had it on you,” Okin replied. “If you don’t have it, I am going to leave.”

The beggar clasped his hand on Okin’s shoulder and pulled the man in.

“It--- I will show you once we reach my home. It is less than a minute from here,” he continued on.

They turned off the Straeiht ere Revictus and onto one of the less prominent residential roads. There were several men, women and children wrapped up in blankets sitting on the unpaved roads. 

They stared at Okin with wide, hungry eyes, but not at the vagrant. Perhaps it was because he was one of them.

“I never got your name, Ather,” The vagrant turned Okin’s attention.

“I am High Ather Okin. And yourself?” Okin asked.

The vagrant chuckled. “I have not gone by any one name in the longest time. But if you like, you can call me Ateon.”

Okin nodded. Ateon. He had never heard of anyone go by that name before.

Okin had the urge to stop and give each beggar a steltell or two, but he vagrant continued a hurried pace.

The houses here looked abandoned, which was quite shocking considering how packed the rest of The Citadel was.  Ateon turned onto a street which was even more run-down and barren than the rest of them. There were no beggars in front of the houses, and the only sound Okin could here was the brush of his shoes against the ground.

Ateon then turned in between two houses into a small alleyway of sorts. The shadow of the buildings made it even darker and harder to see than usual, and Okin could only make out the dark form that was the vagrant’s back. There was some shuffling, and then the man held out loose, wrinkled paper.

“Here,” he said.

Okin snatched the paper. He took a glimpse---it was lines of handwriting, much messier than the print of the proper Versalist texts. 

“I was... pulling your leg when I was talking about this book. But no, it’s not what you think,” Ateon said. Okin looked up and met his eyes. Despite the darkness, by the deepening and newfound clarity of the man’s voice he could tell the beggar was serious, almost solemn. “I knew that you had never looked upon such a text, but it *is* real, and it is part of the *Versalist Onorun*. The *original* Versalist Onorun, that is. I myself have only one copy, and I trust no one else with it. I have given you one page to read over.”

Okin’s face scrunched up and he stepped back.  “W-what? What are you talking about?” 

“The Citadel, they are hiding secrets from you, from all of the world. There are several important texts of Versalism that they keep to themselves. A small group, some as high up as you can imagine.”

“Wait, wait, wait,” Okin held out his hands. He looked down to the floor and squeezed his eyes as he thought about the implications of this man’s outlandish allegations. “What--- what *proof* do you have of this extreme claim?”

The cloaked man shrugged. “All I have is what I’ve presented to you. But I surmise a man such as yourself would care to investigate, precisely *because* of the paramount implications if it true. If I am wrong, you can curse me with every name in the book, and nothing will change.

“But if I am right--- and there are words from the Gods that are being hidden,” the beggar motioned to Okin’s right hand where his tattoos lay, “then, surely, Truth and Justice will never be fulfilled.”

Okin paced in a small circle before the alley of darkness. He yanked the page out of his pocket. Even squinting as close as possible, it was far too dark to read. He stopped, scrutinizing as best he could the cloaked and shielded face of the vagrant. 

“You said--- this goes high up as I can imagine? So...the Impaliases?” Okin sputtered.

Ateon simply nodded. “Yes. Some.”

Okin’s next inquiry held in his throat. But he forced it out.

“I-I report to Impalias Aldwin. Might he have any knowledge of this--- conspiracy?”

“I do believe so,” the cloaked man replied with an uptick in his voice. “But he won’t be honest with you if you try to confront him the way I think you will try.”

Okin’s finger thrust forward. “You are saying that Aldwin, an *Impalias of Aredal*, is partaking in a most deathly form of dishonesty? That he would lie to a fellow clergyman of The Citadel?”

“Well,” there was almost a mischief in Ateon’s voice. “I *believe* that he, and others, are already taking part in a widespread dishonesty in order to hide these texts. Have I--- not made that assertion clear?”

Okin spun around, searching for the now only bit of Light in the stars above. All this--- *conspiracy* had made him forget about the ghastly Darkness that surrounded him. He craned his neck to gaze at the brightest star in the sky. Many believed that was the realm of Aredal himself, a world that shone with pure Light even in the darkest night.

“Well--- yes, you have. And I---,” the star flickered above him. If that really was the realm of Aredal, the realm of Light, it called for him to show his Dedication. To do *more,* to stand up and be *Brave* in the name of Truth and Justice.

“I almost find myself wanting to believe you, after what I’ve seen today. But--- I cannot. How can I--- discover whether a man is deceiving me if he will not tell me, and all else will be deception of my own?”

“My friend, my friend,” the vagrant’s voice was almost comforting. As the man placed a hand on his shoulder, Okin forgot that he was in a dark alley, well past evening, with a cloaked, homeless man.  

“I am not asking you to go behind the backs of your superiors. I have given you what I believe to be true. If you look further, you will find it too. Choose to walk with eyes open--- and see the real meaning of Truth.”

Okin nodded. He felt a wealth of possibilities sink through his brain. There was *something* going on here, with Billy and Synodontis, with the claims of this mysterious man. Perhaps this was his chance to prove his Dedication in Bravery and Justice.

He looked deep past the dirtied face of the vagrant into warm, hazel eyes that strangely comforted him; almost like a fireplace. 

“I--- I will try,” was all that Okin could say.
