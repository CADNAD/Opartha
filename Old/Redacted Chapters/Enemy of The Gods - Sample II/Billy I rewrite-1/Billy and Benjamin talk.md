Benjamin nodded with an open mouth like he had just solved a mystery, which made Billy’s fists curl. 

“This ain’t our home anymore,” he said.

“Well, yeah. But I still think of it as home, really,” Damian said. The three leant up against the rail and watched as the ship became parallel against the once-distant coastline. 

Billy grimaced. He glanced down at his golden watch; it was already evening. Damian and him could get a good, real rest, unlike the shoddy hours of sleep they had gotten on the boat, and still make it on time.

“I’m surprised you even remember. How old were you when you left? Four?” Benjamin scoffed.

“Eight\[ 2021-10-26, 11:22 AM

Change if Damian’s age changes\],” Damian said. “To be honest, I remember Wreathward pretty well. Each day in Apathasaw is... much more similar to the last. In Wreathward, there were---“

“Benjamin, don’t you have crew stuff to do?” Billy interjected.

Benjamin looked at Billy and gave a pompous smile; Billy knew that *he* knew what Billy was doing. 

“Not really, but I guess I could go down to make sure we moor safely,” the dark-skinned man replied. 

Billy forced a smile and Benjamin gave a slight nod. Benjamin left Billy and Damian at the front porch of the ship, and Billy’s heart calmed. Though Benjy could be a little...*nosy*, he also knew when to back off.

For a while, Billy and Damian enjoyed the fresh breeze and elegant view of the warm sunset landing on the edges of the ocean waves in silence. Billy smiled; though of course he had his worries, he liked to see Damian in such high spirits. 

“Billy? Is something... wrong?” Damian asked. 

Like Benjy, though, Damian could read him too, and he could also sometimes be too nosy. Billy also knew how to control himself and avoid being read, though, and he offered up nothing but an empty stare into the horizon.

“No,” he replied. “Why would you think that?”

Damian looked up at Billy in an attempt to uncover something deeper, but there wasn’t even the tiniest of facial expression to observe. 

“Well I--- I’ve never seen you so... *stiff* with Benjamin,” Damian said.

“Benjy doesn’t need to know any more about us than he already does,” Billy said. 

“But,” Damian gave a reserved laugh. “You guys are like--- Benjamin’s the closest thing either of us have to a best friend.”

“It’s not about Benjamin,” Billy turned to Damian and leaned in with narrowed eyebrows. This had quickly turned into an opportunity to teach the boy an important life lesson. 

“Benjamin is... he’s a good man, as far as I know. But what *I* don’t know, what you don’t know, what no one really can know, is how far some people will go to put on the *appearance* of being good. There are schemers, tyrants and sycophants that go on fooling people for longer than either of us have been alive. The only thing we can know for certain is that *anyone* can use *anything* against us,” Billy said.

Damian shook his head. “Yeah, I know, there are frauds in this world, but *Benjamin*, we’ve known him for *years*, and he’s never done anything other than be kind to us! And *you’re* the one that first became friends with him. Why would---“

“*I said*,” Billy interjected, “It’s not about Benjamin, and it’s not about *me,* either. Sailors, they have big mouths. Do we really *know* anyone else on this ship that well? 

Billy raised an eyebrow, and Damian looked at him, blinking. Classic Damian, absolutely silent when he wasn’t confident to give a response. For Billy, that meant it was time to continue his argument.

“We’re not supposed to be here, Damian! The fact that some of them know our *names* is too much! This... this trip, it’s not like a... positive thing, y’know?”

Damian sputtered and looked at Billy confusedly. 

“You-you’re the one that wanted to come here, Billy!” He shouted. “This was your idea!”

“Yes!” Billy nodded. “We had to come. And we’re here now, and we’re not giving up. But--- now especially, we must have our guards up. We do not--- we *cannot*--- trust anyone.”

Damian nodded solemnly and let out a deep sigh. Billy did as well. Perhaps the boy didn’t understand now, and there would always be some rebellion, but eventually, he *would* get it. 

He should’ve already, though, based on what they had lived through. Maybe Benjamin was right; it was too hard to remember as the boy was so young.

Hopefully Billy’s lectures would be enough to fill that fill that void of experience.

The ship pulled in closer to shore, and Damian’s excitement returned.

“That’s it, Billy!” the dark-haired boy pointed at a massive wooden deck, with several boats moored alongside or hovering nearby. “That’s the dock that we left from!”

“Yeah,” Billy’s voice was dry. “It is.”

The ship slowly made its way around others; many disappeared underneath their vision as they past, though one had a deck several metres taller, and towered over their ship, casting a shadow over Billy and Damian as it passed.

For a second, the darkness that swiped over his eyes flooded his entire surroundings. The sky became black, the sun’s rays became thundering rain and streaks of lightning. The boat thrashed underneath him, and his legs shook.

The massive ship sailed past, and the shadow with it. The distant sunset lit up Billy’s face again, and everything returned to normal. 

His eyes darted back and forth, ensuring the image of  reality all around him. 

His knees trembled and he clutched the rails. His fingers grew as white as the lightning he had seen just seconds ago. 

Catching himself, he made sure not to hasten his breath. He glanced at Damian; the lad hadn’t noticed.

“C’mon, Billy!” Damian motioned for Billy to come back down to the main deck with him. The cowboy stabilized himself and followed the lad.
