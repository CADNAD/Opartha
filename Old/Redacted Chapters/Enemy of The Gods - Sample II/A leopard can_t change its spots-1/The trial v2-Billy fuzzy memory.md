Okin opened a small book, reading for a few seconds before he asked his first question. 

“Do you confirm that you are Billy Gruissem, the only biological son of Lionos Gruissem of Metheno?”

Billy nodded. “Yes. Sir.” 

Okin raised an eyebrow before turning to Damian for his next question. “And do you confirm that you are commonly referred to as Damian, and although you had no surname on record, lived with Lionos Gruissem for a portion of your childhood?”

Damian nodded. “Yes.”

“Would you consider Lionos Gruissem to be your surrogate father?” Okin asked.

Billy looked to his brother. He was sure of the answer that would follow.

“Yes," Damian replied.

“And do you," Okin addressed Billy again, “Billy Gruissem, confess that you had involvement in the death of your father?”

Billy looked into the Okin’s eyes as he made his response. He wanted to strike the answer into Okin’s heart.

“No, I had no involvement in the death of my father.”

The crowd erupted into incessant chatter, which prompted Okin to turn to the rest of the pews.

“Please, we ask that you remain silent during this proceeding.” The chatter died down.

“Do you, Damian, confess that you had involvement in the death of Lionos Gruissem?” 

“No, I had no involvement in his death,” Damian replied.

Okin glanced back down to the text. He read for a few seconds. He then whispered to Minos, who nodded.

“We find it unlikely that you had no part in your father’s death,” Minos said. “You had a clear motive and opportunity, and the setting and nature of the murder all points back to you.”

Billy gnarled his teeth. What kind of motive did he have, a helpless teen now in control of an estate which he possessed no knowledge of how to manage? Not to mention that he didn’t even end up touching one steltell of that worth. He wanted to scream his point, but he knew interruption would not help his case.

“Everyone knew that your father was planning to donate a large amount of his wealth to have a new Cathedral constructed here, in Metheno, as well as committing a large part of his fortune towards establishing trade routes with the new Vianaryan colonies. These projects would drastically lower the inheritance of the Gruissem estate--- of which you were the sole beneficiary,” Minos looked down from the raised altar, giving Billy a scolding stare. “It is rather convenient that your father turned up dead just a few days before either of these contracts were to be signed.”

Anger flared in Billy’s stomach. The fact that this mindless sheep would accuse him of murdering his beloved father only for an early inheritance was outrageous. He stood up valiantly, aiming his voice towards the Athers. 

“I would never even think of laying a hand on my father---“

The soldiers reached up to pull Billy down by the shoulders as Okin rose, slamming his hand on the altar.  He wanted to spin around and kick them both in the gut, but he just fell limp and sat back down.

“It is not your turn to speak, defendant,” Okin said, his voice calming after the order. “You may continue, High Ather Minos.”

Minos’ moustache curled up. It gloated at Billy, who was now tethered in his seat by the guards. 

“Your impulsiveness once again makes itself clear. Which also gives credence to the setting and aftermath of the crime--- your father was found dead in his own home, his possessions gone. The only other people living in the residence at the time were the two of you, who were never to be seen after the night he was murdered. Only you would know where his possessions were, where he stored his money.”

“May I please make a rebuttal?” Billy raised his hand. The guards’ grip on his arms tightened.

Okin looked to Minos, who nodded. “Yes, you may continue,” he said.

The guards loosened their grip from his arms, and Billy stood up to make his point. “I did not take anything. Look at me now--- I have nothing!”

“May I present myself as a witness?” A voice from the back of the church made itself clear. Standing up from the back of the pews was that same, devilish old man---Mr. Cantas, Okin’s father.

Okin looked down the pew to his own father, and then nodded. “Yes, please come up until you are just in front of the first pew, before the altar.”

*What the cink does he have to say? Why must this nosy old man get his fingers into everything?*

Mr. Cantas strode as confidently as a man his age could down the aisle, his eyebrows furrowing at Billy as he made his way up. Billy matched his glare.

Turning to the altar, Mr. Cantas spoke. “This felon has only spoke a few lines since arriving in this church, yet already most of them have been lies. Before arriving at the cemetery, he took a trip to my house, the sly devil. But much like Tregale or any of his followers, the man’s cunning is only outmatched by his impulsiveness. I must provide the court with the context that the town of Metheno has entrusted me with taking care of Lionos’s property after his untimely demise. Billy here--- he intruded on Lionos’s property, and pretended to be a businessman. I did not recognize him, and I invited him into my own home, where he *insisted* that I give him whiskey, and used a false alias by the name of Saul. If he was truly convinced of his innocence, he would see no need to hide his identity--- nor that watch of his,” the old man pointed a stubby finger at Billy. 

“He says he took nothing of his father’s, well check his wrist! Those who knew Lionos would know that golden watch never left his arm, until his son murdered him and plucked it from his cold, dead hand!”

The crowd centred their focus to Billy, urging him to tug down his sleeve and reveal his wrist. The sweat built up from his face as he realized his blunder.

“Defendant Billy. May you please show the court your left wrist?” Okin asked.

Grunting, Billy pulled down his shirt sleeve and raised his arm. The golden watch glowed against him in the misty sunlight which reflected through the windows of the church.

The audience let out sighs and gasps, and the chatter resumed.

“Please, I ask again that you all remain silent until the trial is over,” Okin commanded. “Do you have anything else to add, witness?”

“Only one more comment,” Okin’s father replied, and his son nodded, giving the go-ahead. 

“Lionos was a dear friend of mine, and I am often disheartened when thinking about the tragedy of his son. Some of you may not know this, but Billy was given a gift by the Gods--- he was granted the power of Time Heraldry. But he didn’t appreciate this gift for what it was worth, just as he didn’t appreciate all that his father had done for him. Just a few months before the murder, Billy and his father got into a dispute about whether he could go to the new Time Institute in Caspo. His father had previously promised him that he could attend the Insititue, but he reconsidered, but only because the man wanted to spend more time with his son. But the entitled son, who only saw his father as a tool, sought revenge against him for it.”

Billy’s eyes watered, and he hung his head downwards. His hands covered his peripherals as he tried to blink away the tears. Behind the altar, the older moustached man and the younger, reptilian-eyed Ather were shaking their heads in disgust. Okin stared at Billy directly--- not in a judgemental manner, but an investigative one. Billy quickly looked back down to his knees.

“Thank you for your statement," Okin said, and his father bowed to the altar before turning and marching towards the back of the church. 

“This question is for Billy," Okin said, and Billy quickly wiped his eyes before peeking out of the pew. “As you profess that you had no involvement in his death, do you know anyone who was involved in the murder of Lionos Gruissem?”

Billy straightened his back and wiped the last droplets from below his eyes. Okin was giving him a chance, and maybe it wasn’t over yet. 

“Yes,” Billy replied, lip quivering. “It was... the Synodontis. Synodontis Tzen.”

The entire crowd gasped, and even some of the guards had audible reactions. 

“I will remind you again to please, keep the noise to a minimum.” Okin looked to Billy, his eyes now locked with intrigue. “Please, expand on this accusation. What do purport to have happened between the Synodontis and your father?”

Billy’s heart boomed inside his chest. “He---he was visiting Metheno and went to meet my father at our house. As a young boy, I remember excited and curious about being able to see the Synodontis. B-but---,”

Billy’s tongue caught in his throat, and his mind tried to sweep over the events, but there was nothing--- nothing but bright flashes and screaming.

The Athers looked to Billy with wide eyes, waiting for him to continue. After several seconds, the older Ather, Minos, whispered into Okin’s ear, and he reacted with a nod.

“There are no accounts of the Synodontis of the Zhen Empire ever visiting Metheno. Do you have anything else to present to back up this accusation?”

Billy squeezed his eyes closed. He heard yelling, but it was indistinguishable what was being said. Something about ‘god’ and ‘son.’ The only thing he could hear clearly was his father yelling ‘You’re nothing!’

And of course, the light. The burning, blinding, light.

Pulling his eyes open, Billy raised himself up. “My father insulted The Synodontis, and for that The Synodontis burned a hole through his face.”

Billy could feel the frustration, the *tension* coming from the audience who was forced to stay silent. It fuelled his own rage. The Athers looked to each other again, their unintelligible communication escalating Billy’s nerves. What were they saying? Did they believe his story?

Unexpectantly, a bearded guard who stood outside the pew stepped to the centre of the stage in front of the altar. “Your holiness, may I please present myself as a witness?”

Okin’s attention diverted from his fellow judges to the lone guard. “It will be allowed.”

The guard bowed his head, and then stood back on his feet. 

“I remember I was just a new recruit to the town guard when we were called into Lord Gruissem’s house after one of his associates alerted us of his fallen corpse inside his own home,” the guard said. “It was accompanied by reports of a gunshot heard in the Dark hours.”

“There was much investigation into the cause of death, but it definitely wasn’t any burns or signs of Light Heraldry on his body. He was shot. The safe was also opened, and one of the revolvers which is purported to be Lionos’s favorite--- was missing.” the guard turned to Billy. “I believe this man is just trying to make an outlandish case to avoid responsibility and send us on a goose chase.”

*What? That’s impossible! This guard must be corrupt, or on The Synodontis’ payroll, or is just a dirty asshole who wants to see me hanged!*

He closed his eyes again. He tried to repicture the image of his father’s murder, but once again, there was nothing.

Okin gave a definitive nod to the guard, who again bowed his head. “Thank you for your statement,” the Ather said. The two judges surrounding him tried to pull him into another conversation, but Okin ignored them, pulling his attention towards the righthand pew, towards Damian.

“Defendant Damian, with your hand to the Gods, do you testify to having seen Billy Gruissem murder Lionos Gruissem?” 

“No, I did not witness such a thing,” Damian replied. 

*Well, at least* he *hasn’t* *gone insane and turned against me,* Billy thought.

Okin nodded and raised his voice again.

“Defendant Damian, with your hand to the Gods, do you testify to having seen Synodontis Tzen murder Lionos Gruissem?”

“No, I did not witness it,” Damian replied.

Billy’s heart skipped a beat, and his neck twisted towards Damian. The younger man answered without a flinch.

*What is he doing? Does he want to see us get* cinking *hanged? This is the only opportunity we had to get out of this shit, and he just threw it away!*

Sweat poured down Billy’s face as he watched the chatty, judgemental Athers discuss in a huddled group.  His face shook with rage.

“Excuse me!” Raising his arm, Billy stood up. The guards at his sides grabbed his shoulders in an attempt to pull him down, but Okin gestured to Billy, causing the guards to let up as he made his statement.  He wanted to shove the sycophants off of him, but instead remained still, letting them naturally release him.

“May I request that the guards stand outside this pew? They are making it quite difficult for me to present my defence, being so close and all.”

“Request granted,” Okin said, and the guards, shaking their heads, got up and stood on the aisles surrounding the pew. 

Billy pulled in Damian close, leaning into his ear.

“Why the cink did you say that Damian?”

“I’m sorry, Billy. I’m just not comfortable with lying,” Damian whispered.

“But---“

“I really didn’t see The Synodontis kill your father--- you got me after you saw it, remember?” Damian interrupted Billy.

Billy shook his head. His breathing sped up, and he found his eyes darting around, wanting to attack the guards, the Athers, even the crowd.

“Whether it was true or not, now there’s no way they’re gonna say we’re innocent. We’re gonna be cinking hanged, Damian! This isn’t a game, this isn’t Apathasawian court where you can just shovel some shit and get off, here, you get cinking hanged.”

Now Damian’s eyes filled with panic and flashed back and forth from Billy to the row of Athers.

“Defendant Damian.  Are you ready to answer another question?”

Damian looked to Billy for an answer, but his friend just scratched his face fearfully. 

*Wait. It’s not over yet.* 

Eyes lighting up, Billy leaned into Damian’s ear again. 

“Damian. I know, you don’t like doing it. But this--- if you don’t use it now, we might cinking die, Damian. You have to try. You have to *put* it in their heads, you have to.”

“Excuse me,” the older Ather raised his voice. “Are you ready to answer more questions?”

Damian cleared his throat, and then turned to the Athers. “Yes, I am ready to answer more questions.”

“Good,” the elder Ather replied, gesturing to Okin.

Okin looked to Damian and raised his voice, “As you did not witness Synodontis Tzen murdering Lionos Gruissem...”

Damian raised his right hand and placed his index finger and middle finger gently against his temple. Even with his hands shaking, it was subtle. Closing his eyes, he pointed his hand forward towards the altar.

“Do you confess to having any role in the murd---“

A stream of darkness rushed out of Damian’s head. A deep obsidian purple, the rootlike streams grew, skyrocketing straight towards the Athers. Cutting across the crowd, the tendrils dissolved into a cloud of flaky ash as it crossed the light from the overhanging glass mural. The Athers ducked below the table. The crowd screamed from behind. Realizing the dark form which manifested in front of him, Damian’s eyes a lit with shock and panic, but he didn’t have any time to react before the guards rushed into the pews and came crashing down on top of him. 

Billy stared in horror at his brother as his convulsing head was engulfed by the surrounding guards. 

The moustached Ather, Minos, stood to his feet. “Guards! Get them out of here!” He shouted, and the guards tied up Damian’s arms behind his back, while others pointed their muskets towards his skull. “I think we’ve heard enough today. May you all please exit the church so we can discuss our decision.” 

The audience, many of whom were still holding their faces with mouths wide open, began to frantically make their way for the door. Within a minute, the room was clear, exempt the Athers, the guards, and the two defendants. 

Billy took a shaky breath, glancing between the exit and Damian. He counted the steps between himself and the door way, two dozen or so. Maybe it would be possible to for him to make it, but Damian could never. The boy’s brown hair was draped over his eye. Early signs of bruising shut his left eye closed, and two cuts on his lip swelled out.

Billy grimaced. Looking at his brother’s bloodied face, he stood down. Making it out alone was the only option, and that was not worth half the effort. 

Seeing Billy surrender, the guards removed their barrels from the side of Damian’s skull. Slowly, a sigh of relief passed through the Athers as the momentary violence calmed down. 

*Were they always such pussies?* Billy continued to raise his hands in the air, giving a meek smile as to calm the room.

The three Athers exchanged glances. Minos and Lissom pushed in around Okin, forming a small huddle. Their lips moved wordlessly, passing Billy and Damian’s fortune between them. Billy stood, but urged to inch closer and eavesdrop. But before the urge could overcome him, the three broke their huddle. His old friend’s face was hardened, a dark aurora hanging over him. His eyes were narrowed yet hollow. 

“The court has made their decision,” Okin spoke, picking through each word slowly. “Though we would need more time to reach a unanimous conclusion on the death of Lionos Gruissem--- we have *definitive* proof here that the two of you were hiding, conspiring, and using Dark Heraldry. Billy Gruissem, Damian, we sentence you to judgement by Aredal.” 

Instantly, Billy’s rage flared. *Just cinking say it! You’re going to execute us! Stop hiding behind these cinking masks!*

Billy cleared his throat, and put on a cordial voice. 

“So we are to be executed. Is there anything else we can do, *anything* to prove our innocence?”

“The court has decided that your guilt is definite. May Aredal damn us if we have exploited or misrepresented Justice,” Minos said. Looking down the bridge of his nose, his thick eyebrows crunched up in disdain. He waved, motioning for the guards to take them away. The guard behind Damian, jolted him to his feet. At the same time another guard grabbed Billy. He struggled, slipping free. He jumped like the wind, before the butt of a gun came hard into his spine. Being lay out onto the floor, Billy struggled for breath. He gasped--- his eyes up and met Okin’s. The Ather’s brown eyes looked into his; a mix of disappointment, anger, and sadness. Tears welled in him before Okin jerked his head away. 

Seeing his old friend pity him, Billy’s rage boiled over. Pushing himself off the ground, he started towards Okin. *I wonder when you became such a sheep*, he thought. He opened his mouth to shout, but was quickly tackled and binded. 

Kicking his feet like a petulant child, Billy yelled out his old friend’s name. “Yes, I hope Aredal does damn you bastards! Your brains are filled with shit but you can’t accept that you’re just cinking slaves so you take the shit out of your brains and stuff it between the ears of others!”

His flaming eyes glared at the back of his friend’s head. “Okin! Why are you still his puppet?!” 

Okin turned his head, but remained silent. Instead it was Linnos who spoke. “The necessary preparations will be made. Tomorrow morning, you shall be delivered for judgment.”  

The other two nodded. Slowly they turned, their black robes fluttering in their wake. Coming down off the stand, the three left without another word. 

“Okin! Okin!” Billy continued to scream before he was winded again. A punch from another one of the Rothars. His vision faded as he struggled for breath. His legs limp, Billy was dragged out of the church, beaten, but not broken.
