Making their way onto the dock, Billy was a street whore at a ballroom gala.  Billy’s dusty, brown leather jacket, boots, and cowboy hat, topped off with the worn denim chaps, and his holstered revolver, stuck out from the two distinct styles seen by the other men occupying the dock; There were men with coloured coats and ornate waistcoats, wearing breeches or dress pants and with curled hair, most likely to be passengers or businessmen.  The other men, sailors, wore linen shirts and trousers. Damian looked like maybe he could blend in with the latter, although he’d have to do up his hair and dust off his clothing, but he was quite conventional compared to Billy, or even the rest of Benjamin’s crew, who were all on a spectrum from cowboys to pirates.

While most of the sailors were busy loading up ships, Billy got a multitude of stares from the other men, but he challenged them with a sharp glare like a lion among hyenas, while Damian occupied Billy’s shadow like a scared cub.

“I think we should probably buy some new clothes," Damian whispered to Billy’s ear.

“I only have money for the return trip, and they use a different currency here," Billy replied, turning right so that they were moving inland from the port.  The town they were entering was filled with brightly coloured villas and paved brick streets. White, yellow, and even some pink and green houses gave the block individuality; yet they all shared red brick roofs, dark red accenting, arched doors and similar square builds with triangular rooftops which gave the necessary sense of uniformity.  

Jogging up in front of Billy, Damian made himself clear.  “Billy, what about food?  Water?  What are we gonna do?”

“What we used to do.  Take it," Billy replied, pushing past Damian.

“But if we get arrested here, it’s not gonna be like in Apathasaw.  We can’t just work it off and go back to life as normal, we’d be locked up and stuck here!”

Damian was right. Scowling, Billy stopped walking and turned to face his friend.  “Well, do you want food or not? We don’t have time to cinking settle down and look for a job, now do we?”

Damian slumped his shoulders.  “Yeah, I guess.  It just seems like you always hurt someone, or get---”

“Stop moaning already!  You don’t do anything but moan!  With the flick of your finger you could make someone get us anything we need, but you decide to act like a cinking baby and make me do everything!”

Damian backed away from the cowboy, who was now red in the face, teeth gnarling.  The yelling and cursing had attracted even more unwanted eyes, which were already magnetized to Billy as flies to dung.

Deflecting their gazes, Billy swatted his hand through the air around him.  “I’m sorry. Go back to your business.”

Damian bit his lip as he followed a storming Billy through the town’s main square.  Smiling men and women in elegant coats and dresses strutted along the town square, orbiting around the exquisite marble fountain which sat in the centre of the square.  It depicted a man with a youthful face and confident posture, with one hand on his hip and the other blocking the sun out of his eyes so he could stare off into the distance. On his back stretched mighty wings, putting even the likes of a bald eagle to shame, and so did his pretentiousness and pride.  Damian’s eyes fixated on the statue.

“I don’t remember the town having a statue of Revictus when we were growing up,”  Damian said.  ‘Was that always there?”

Looking to the centre of the square Billy replied, “Who cares?  I know you’d like to, but we aren’t here ogle at men.”  Damian smiled as they continued northwards.
