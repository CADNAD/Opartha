* Guidelines for this doc format
- For **, this means that this key beat occurs, and then
  everything grouped after it is all the beats/scenes that occur
  after it until the next beat begins. e.g: ** Midpoint will start
  with the first crucial beat (the midpoint itself), which are
  additionally marked with ! as a prefix, and then scenes which
  follow after. This is why Break into X is in Act X. The ! points
  of the last beat of the act are duplicated as the first beat of
  the next act to show continuity.

Ty-shou's main power comes from his genuine love for humanity. Wosa tries to force it but it doesn't work because it is not genuine love. Aredal's version of the power was to amplify the aspects of a person, but Ty-Shou has a twisted version based on his own ego and self image that makes everyone a reflection of himself and super soldiers.
