The fire still burned in Okin’s eyes. He could see it dancing, but he knew it was the upbeat dance was merely the futile struggles of a youth whose death was inevitable. It had past nearly an hour ago. The memories were vibrant, yet a blur: Rothars sweeping up the charred corpse and removing the dried-out stake, people dispersing from the crowd and returning to their business, as Okin stood still, the muffled screams ringing in his ears.

He knew it had to be done. He knew that the boy had been corrupted into a servant of the Darkness. But the temptation of Tregale was much like the temptations of a beautiful woman--- they attempted to trick Okin by making him believe they were an object of innocence, that they deserved his love.

But he was merely that--- a *boy.* How could one so young commit themselves to such evil? Or perhaps that was the issue to begin with--- maybe the youth were too impressionable, too easy to take advantage of. 

The convulsing, melting body of the damned continued to flood Okin’s mind. He squeezed his eyes shut, but the darkness just created a cleaner canvas for his memory. The images of the sea of faces, the Ather’s prideful proclamation, and the heretic’s violent struggling blinked in front of him, along with the same burning sensation of the fire so close to his skin, the rave of the crowd and the boy’s demonic wailing as he was engulfed in flames.

His imaginings were interrupted by the squeak of the door opening.

“Okin?” Aldwin held open his front door with a frail hand. “I’m sorry I kept you waiting, I had some matters to attend to.” 

Okin put on a fake smile. “No need for an apology, I am the one who should be apologizing for such an impromptu meeting.”

“Well, it was very out of the blue\[ 2021-08-07, 10:35 AM

Should we use these types of expressions?\]. But, come in,” Aldwin motioned with his free hand to the innards of the house.

Okin bowed and removed his shoes before stepping through the doorway. 

“So, what do I owe the pleasure?” Aldwin asked as they walked through the hallways, passing several landscape paintings with golden frames.

“I---I have some inquiries,” Okin entered into the dining room after Aldwin.

“Do tell,” though his arms were shaky, Aldwin still politely insisted on being a good host, and pulled out a chair for Okin.

Okin paused before sitting down, now his own arms were shaky. Aldwin waited with a kind, wrinkly smile. His hands rested on the back of the chair, waiting for Okin to sit.

But Okin did not. Instead, he looked Aldwin straight in the eyes, searching for honesty. Searching for Truth.

“Impalias Aldwin. I have some--- suspicions that may or may not be true. They will sound ridiculous, yes, but I must ask you in the name of Truth and Justice.”

Aldwin raised a bushy eyebrow. “Go on.”

“I-I investigated the Whenranish border records of the days leading up to the death of  Lionos Gruissem. And yes, there is a report of a caravan transporting the Synodontis only four days before Lionos’s death,” Okin said.

Aldwin’s face was stern and still. “Are you suggesting that this proves Billy Gruissem’s claim?” He finally asked.

“Not proves. But it is certainly suspicious. No one else knew about this, and there is no way a little-known record like this could be fabricated by someone as powerless as Billy,” Okin moved closer, but Aldwin’s gaze was still unmoving, and would never meet his.

“It *is* very suspicious. Still, perhaps the son is telling the Truth about Synodontis being in the area around that time, and knew a controversial visiting foreigner would be an easy scapegoat. You told me the guards reported finding slashes, not burns as Billy claimed,” Aldwin replied.

“Billy’s story is... shaky,” Okin admitted. There was no getting around it; the Billy he saw that day was a flawed, angry man whose words seemed to contradict those of everyone around him. But---

“Something is wrong, though, still. Everywhere Synodontis goes, word spreads. This--- no one else ever spoke of this. Why would the most powerful leader in Marthia, *Deionis*, the most powerful leader in *Opartha* hide his travel to a relatively small town like Metheno?

“I...,” Aldwin looked at Okin, eyes void of hope. “I do not know, Okin. And to be honest, I do not know if we will ever know.”

Okin’s eyes fled to the tiled floor again. He nodded mindlessly, for his mind was focused on that almost deathly statement. Perhaps he would *never* find the Truth. At least in this matter.

“There... there is something else,” Okin’s jaw clenched. “I--- an allegation has been brought forward that a small sect of The Citadel is hiding crucial Versalist text--- word of the Gods.”

Aldwin almost fell back in his chair in shock. Yes, a laugh or scowl would be expected from even an ordinary farmer at this outrageous conspiracy.

“The--- the accuser condemned you, as well,” Okin finally met Aldwin’s grey eyes.

Aldwin shook his head. His eyebrows furrowed. 

“What *accuser*? What--- what nonsense is this, Okin?” 

“I am just relaying what another has relayed to me. Nothing more, nothing less. I am giving the most absolute Truth I have, and... I expect the same,” Okin’s voice softened. “As you have always given me.”

“The Versalist texts were received by the first Mouth of the Gods and the first Impaliases before the end of the Betrayal, Okin! The record of the Betrayal and the following events were found only a few decades later. That--- how could some sect in The Citadel hide this for what--- *a thousand years*? Who is spreading this--- laughable conspiracy?” 

Aldwin chuckled. Okin wanted to sigh, but he held it in. The Truth was, it was laughable. This was probably a dead end, same as Billy.

“It--- I met him in the records room,” Okin peered down at his feet. “He appeared to be a vagrant.”

Aldwin scoffed and shook his head. “Well, I commend you for *still* being one of, if not the most honest Ather I have ever known, Okin. But--- I’m afraid that as you probably expected, these were the machinations of some madman.”

“It is most likely that, unfortunately, Nexon bless him, the man has gone mad and is believing his own fantasy, but *perhaps* the Eterions or Hyesites have tried to muddle in our faith again by spreading false and fabricated texts.”

Okin found his head bobbing along with Aldwin’s speculations. It was true, in The Citadel, there were a myriad of ways these kind of rumours could be spread.

“Well, thank you again, Okin,” Aldwin patted the Ather on the shoulder and smiled. The two of them got up from their seats in unison. 

“Thank you, Impalias Aldwin,” Okin bowed. “I apologize that I had to bring up these conspiracies to you, but I’m glad you understand why I felt it was my duty.”

“Yes, of course,” Aldwin smiled as he led Okin out of the kitchen and down the hall. 

Aldwin held open the door for Okin while the Ather put on his shoes. 

“And Okin, if you see that poor madman again, please try to get him some help. I know that there’s a chapel of Nexon just down the street that would gladly take him in,” Aldwin said.

“I will try my best, but I can’t promise anything,” Okin stood up and thanked Aldwin again.

“Thank you, Okin,” Aldwin said. “And you make a great help here in The Citadel, but if you do wish to return to Ariska I will not impede you.”

Okin smiled and gave another respectful nod before leaving. The manor door clicked closed, and he turned to stare out at the bustling street. His eyes lost focused, and it all become a blurry backdrop as he pondered whether maybe it *was* the right decision to leave this place.

*All this craziness has re-emerged since I have come here. Perhaps... perhaps it is best for me to return to Ariska, where chaos is infrequent and my mind is more at ease.*
