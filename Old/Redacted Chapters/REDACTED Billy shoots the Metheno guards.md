“I barely remembered what it looked like," Damian said, prompting Billy to turn around and look at him.  Those eyes hadn’t changed at all.

“Who do you think lives there now?," Damian asked.

“I don’t give a fuck.  We didn’t come to meet the new housesitters.”

Billy’s eyes watered as he turned towards the cemetary.  Over the iron fences and stone pillars, eerily similar to those which guarded his childhood home,  sat the decrepit gravestones of the fallen townspeople.  Near the center of the cemetery, some hundred feet from him, men and women dressed in black were gathered around.   Peeking out from behind one of the pillars, Billy saw the back of a man in a white robe with golden accenting.  He remembered going to mass with his father, and seeing the robed man who led it walk around town sometimes- the Ather.  But this man did not resemble the Ather which Billy remembered- he had much thicker and more colorful hair.  

Leaning forward, Billy made his way around the gap in the pillars, towards the gathering.

Reaching forward, Damian tapped Billy’s shoulder. “What are you doing?  You’ll fit in like a slug in a revolver!”

Billy looked to Damian with fierce eyes, forcing his hand away. “Look, I didn’t come across an entire fucking ocean with nothing but a pair of clothes and a gun to sit in a corner and watch," Billy budged forward, Damian unable to stop him.

Stepping through the lines of gravestones, Billy marched towards the gathering, Damian stood nervously in place, unsure of whether to chase after him or just watch.

From behind him, Billy heard galloping, and a thundering voice shoot at him, “You!  Turn around and surrender yourself!”

With increased determination, Billy continued his path through the graveyard.  The sound of planted boots.  

“I am not going to warn you again!  Turn around!”

With a harsh pivot of the heel, Billy turned to face the disturbance.  In front of him, surrounding a cowering Damian, stood six couples- six men, six horses.  The men wore leather armor and carried outdated muskets on their backs, except for one of the men, the shouter, who had his pointed at Billy’s chest.

“Alright,  I’ve turned around, put that thing down," Billy said. 

“You are under arrest for assault, robbery, intrusion, and wandering past curfew!," the leader shouted, ignoring Billy’s request.  The commotion had attracted the eyes of some of the people in the cemetery, but they stayed in place.

“First of all, I haven’t done none of these things, and second---," Billy drew his revolver from his waist.  “Well scram unless you want your head blown off.”

The man angled his musket towards the floor, revealing an amused grin, and the other four men began to laugh.  “What is that, some kind of plaything?," the man shouted.

Smirking, Billy replied, “Yeah, exactly, a plaything.”  He flicked his wrist and a bullet teared through the kneecap of one of the men.  Agonizing screams followed. 

The men quickly came to their senses and reached behind their backs to grab their muskets, but like a drum roll, the explosion of shots fired in quick succession from Billy’s hand, sending four more bullets charging into the knees of all the men except the shouter, who stood terrified.  Like an orphanage choir, the men screamed, clutching their demolished knees.  

The shouter raised the musket back to Billy’s chest.  Billy saw the man tighten his grip, preparing to pull the trigger, and making the reactionary decision to do so.  The ringing from Billy’s drumroll had not yet dissipated, but was joined by the clicking sound of the musket being fired.  The rough iron sphere slowly spun in the air towards Billy’s chest,  wherein he felt his heart palpitate as he forced his shoulders to turn away from the oncoming ball of steel. Looking downwards, he saw the ball slowly fly just under his chin.  Then, in an instant, it zoomed past and crashed into a grave, reducing it to rubble.  

Billy pointed his revolver at the now trembling man, and pulled the trigger.   But all there was was a small *click* as the cylinder was turned onto an empty chamber.

“Shit!”  Billy yelled.  Turning around, the petrified guard pulled himself onto one of the horses and rode back into the street of the main town.   The piercing screams of both the distressed fallen guards and the scared townspeople rang through Billy’s ears.  

“Damian!  Get over here!," Billy screamed.

Damian peeked out from behind the pillar, and then frantically ran over to Billy, weaving around gravestones, standing in between him and the shaking guards.  

“Fuck!," he yelled, slamming his boot into the dirt.  Turning around, he looked to see if there were still people gathered in the center of the graveyard, he could see some heads and clothing poking out from behind the gravestones, and so he ran towards them.  As they saw him, some of them ran away, towards the edge of the graveyard, and others hid their face with their arms, cowering as if he would shoot acid in their eyes.  

Damian followed Billy towards the center of the cemetery, until Billy stopped before a grave that read Wɪʟʟɪᴀᴍ Bʟᴜ and below that 957-1000.  

Crouched just under the engraving was the man in the white robe- the Ather.  As Billy’s eyes made contact with the grave, they soon made contact with the eyes of the kneeling man- and a look of familiarity came across his face.

“Billy?”
