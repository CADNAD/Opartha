There was a heavy knock on the door.

“Billy! Come!” It was Benjamin’s hearty voice.

Billy sighed, getting off his chair and opening the door. Benjamin had a toothy smile on.

“What is---“

“C’mon Billy! Come to dinner! It fantastic festival today, there more food then you can imagine.” The dark-skinned man shouted excitedly.

Billy shook his head. He had come to dinner on the first day, and while the food was better than expected, the constant questioning was enough to deter him from a second visit. Constant ‘Hey, I haven’t seen you before’s, ‘What are you wearing?’s, and ‘What Heraldry are you?’s from the strange cultists hadn’t been a worthy tradeoff. Not only was it annoying, but he didn’t want these creeps finding out any more about him then they already had. Plus, despite everyone else forgetting, this was still very much a *temporary* arrangement.

“C’mon, Billy! They say that bird will take off its cloak, and we see the sky from up high. It only happen once a year! Damian is there already, too. He wants you to be there.”

Billy looked down to the floor, leaning against the doorway. He thought of the words Allia had said earlier, accusing him of not truly looking out for Damian’s interests just because he wouldn’t buy in to this creepy cult. She’d be the last person he let be right about Damian. 

“Fine,” Billy said. “Let’s go.”
