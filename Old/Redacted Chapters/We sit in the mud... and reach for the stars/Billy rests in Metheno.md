Damian rushed along the dirt path with his arm around Billy. 

“What was that about? He offered us a place to stay for the night, we struck resinite!” Billy asked.

“Billy, we can’t be hanging around people that we used to know! I thought you would know that better than anyone!”

Billy groaned, looking down at his feet. “Yeah. I guess we’ll just have to find somewhere else to rest.”

Yawning, the cowboy looked to the fuzzy horizon. The tangerine light mingled with crimson and golden hues, as the sun began to set on the western horizon, creating a violet barrier that guarded the setting sun from the blue sky.  In the skyline, Billy pictured man who had been shot off a cliff, falling into the ocean, his blood fading into the crystal clear waters, muddying what was his bodily fluids and what belonged to the ocean waters.  

After some walking, the two men had gotten to the northeastern corner of the village.

“Over there," Billy whispered, nodding towards a small, unoccupied stable.  There were two stalls that contained resting horses, and one that was left unoccupied, exempt from a small pile of hay.  Sneaking tacitly, the two men approached the covered stable.

“But there’s only one stall, and well--," Damian awkwardly pointed to himself, and then Billy. 

“You take it.”

“Ah, it looks like there’s enough room for the both of us.  It might rain, you wouldn’t wanna---”

“I’d rather get wet then cuddle up with you like some kind of fucking faggot," Billy chuckled.  “Get some rest.”

Nodding sheepishly, Damian climbed over the hay bales, awkwardly laying down on top of them, shovelling off pieces of hay that stuck out.  Turning onto his side, he tucked his hands together under his head like a pillow.

It wasn’t long until Damian appeared to be asleep.  Unmoving, silently breathing, like a resting infant.  Billy enjoyed this time alone, at night, not being bugged by Damian’s whining, or the judgemental, arrogant looks from the ever-conceited natives. And he hadn’t had a taste of *real* liquor for over two weeks. Stumbling over to a sleeping Damian, the young lad shivered a bit, but he still appeared to be asleep.  Even through the strong smell of liquor on his lips, Billy could smell the stench of Damian’s clothes,  which had seen a massive buildup of perspiration.  Or maybe that was his own?  Or even just the smell of the two large, grimy horses which were probably lying in their own shit?  Whatever the case, Billy knew it could be masked by some more drinking, and so he took another swig of the now half-empty bottle of whiskey.  He jugged the rest down in one chug.

Dropping the now empty bottle on the ground,  Billy doddered closer to a sleeping Damian, extremely slowly; he was trying his best not to wake him.  Taking off his jacket, Billy attempted to place it on the shivering Damian, but in doing so he fell forward, his face landing towards Damian’s backside--- Billy could feel his nose touch Damian’s ass.

“Get some rest," Billy murmured, before realizing what he was staring at.  “What am I doing?”  he trailed, trying to stand up but just pushing himself onto the floor.  A waterfall came streaming out of his mouth, or maybe it was more like a volcanic eruption, except upside down.  

Rolling onto his back, Billy could see the twinkling stars up above.  They flashed themselves, smiling at him, were they greeting him?  No, they were mocking him, high on their horse just because they were the little piece of light that could shine through the all-encompassing darkness.  

And one star even flew through the air, he was dancing over Billy, like a gazelle galloping by a crippled, dying tortoise.   

*Fuck the stars.  I wish I never saw you and your fucking dumbass lights ever again.*

And in a few moments,  Billy’s wish was granted.
