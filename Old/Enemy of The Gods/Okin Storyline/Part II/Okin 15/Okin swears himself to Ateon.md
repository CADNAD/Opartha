The two golden triangles\[ 2022-01-24, 2:55 PM

Possibly make it clear that Ateon believes (correctly) that the man at the printer shop is connected to the cult\] on the bottom half of Ateon’s palm pulsed with the flickering fire.

*Justice...and Bravery.* *The two tenants of Dedication which I must prove myself in...*

“You--- you---,” Okin stammered. “You’re an Ather.”

“*Were*,” Ateon said. “A High Ather, like you.”

Okin nodded. Ateon retreated his arm back under his black cloak, and once again Okin could only make out the edges of his dark cloak and beard against the blackness.

“That is where the story begins. At least for me,” Ateon said. 

Okin relaxed and sat up. He’d been yearning to find out what this vagrant was about.

But--- an Ather? He didn’t see that coming. It did seem to make sense, though, and explained how the man could have read the Fourth Book of Nexon.

“I was an Ather, just like you, trained and serving here in The Citadel. I had learned a fair amount about medicine and served wounded soldiers on the battlefield when Farsun attacked Whenran, and that was when my Dedication to Bravery was fully proven,” Ateon’s voice carried a somber weight. “When I returned, The Citadel needed more holy judges and so I Dedicated myself to that when I was not preaching or performing other duties.”

“That sounds very honourable,” Okin said. “But not *so* out of the ordinary for a member of the clergy who is a Dedicant of Aredal.”

“A criminal case was brought up where several testimonies conflicted in nature. The defendant claimed that the police had framed him but I did not know who to believe, there was strong evidence on both sides. I could not rely on the police to do further investigation as The Citadel guard are very loyal to each other and I knew that as the defendant were accusing them of a miscarriage of Justice it would go against the laws of Justice set down in *Aredal.”*

Okin’s ears piqued. Ateon’s mischievous nature--- which already seemed to just be a facade--- was gone. He seemed genuinely to be retelling his past as a pious man of Justice--- though whether he was still that man was now in question.

“I prayed to Aredal but I did not hear his voice,” Ateon continued. “Naturally, I turned to the Onorun for answers. There of course were wise teachings in *Palno*, *Rentar* and *Aredal* about Justice and seeing through the Deception of others, but nothing specific enough for this case. So I asked my peers for advice and if there was anything else the Gods had said on this matter. Most gave me non-answers or simply told me they could not help me. But somehow, someone I asked--- and I never found out who--- had a problem with what I was searching for. I did not know of their meddling at the time, but to them it appeared I was on their trail.”

“Soon after, my Impalias met with me to tell me that he would be ordering me serve in Copaska, just on the border between Trenta and Nairfalk. I was stunned as not only had this come out of nowhere, but it was extremely unusual for a serving judge to be reassigned.”

“My rebellious and firm nature wouldn’t let me leave, and I begged him to reconsider. He said he couldn’t, and I asked him why he would not. He could not answer, but I kept asking. Ironically, perhaps there was even a hint of *Deception* in my question. I knew that my Impalias could not lie.”

“Finally, he broke down into tears. He grabbed me by the shoulders and *begged* me to go. He said that as long as I was here, I was in danger. He claimed that there was a dangerous group *within* The Citadel who controlled things by secretly manipulating the clergy. 

I understood my Impalias’ concerns, but as a young Ather who had just received his full Dedication of Bravery, I would not stand down.  The next day, I showed up in court as a judge, though I know that *someone* in that courtroom was plotting my demise.

During my time as a field medic, the Rothars trained me in basic combat as the Farsunni cavalry were known to flank and attack the army’s support whenever possible. Perhaps I was overconfident, but I thought I could take on whoever they sent after me. 

They sent an assassin, just like the one who attacked you today. But I *knew* he was coming, and I got the element surprise, and was able to fight him and run off.

Coming so close to death, I realized that these people would keep sending men, and that there was no way that I could realistically continue my duties without eventually being killed. 

But--- I would not just stand down, and now that I had been targeted by their assassins they would likely kill me even if I did go to Copaska. 

And so I framed my own demise and went into hiding. I changed my appearance until I looked like nothing more than a crazed beggar.

But I kept searching for information on them, no matter how scarce it was. I told myself that I would take them down.”

Okin smiled and leaned in closer. Finally, he would learn more about this... cult? 

But several seconds passed, and Ateon didn’t speak another word.

“So... what have you learned about them?” Okin said with wide eyes.

“The--- the clergy is so large and both too open and too protected at the same time. One second I thought I had the mark on certain members and the next they would be transferred on a mission to Marthia or the colonies,” Ateon replied grimly.

Okin’s shoulders slumped. This man sounded like he had been at this for years... and it looked like he had found close to nothing.

“But--- I am quite sure that all of the members are members of the clergy and that their base is somewhere here in The Citadel. And... partly thanks to your help--- I do believe that Aldwin is one of their leaders, and may be our key to uncovering and defeating them.”

Okin’s head lowered and he nodded. Knowing that Aldwin had *lied* to him--- that was one thing--- but coming to terms with the fact that his mentor was part of an organized group hiding sacred documents and meddling with The Citadel? A group that had just attempted to *murder* him? 

That would take some time.

“Do you still have the Fourth Book?” Ateon asked.

Okin grabbed his satchel and felt around. His eyes widened. He had left the book back at the visiting complex, for safety reasons. But now...

“It is...,” he looked up with fear in his eyes. “It is back at the visiting complex.”

“No matter. It is too dangerous to go back now. And it appears you have read enough to understand what is at stake,” Ateon said.

“Yes,” Okin said. “I wanted to show the world, I found other texts that backed up its reliability. But now---“

“I doubt that would have convinced many anyways,” Ateon interrupted. “And you would have been hunted and killed sooner or later doing that. It is the unfortunate reality--- but against these people, we must stealthy. 

“Thankfully, we have just gained something that can help with that.”

Ateon stepped forward and held out a dark object towards the lamp light. 

It was the charcoal-beaked mask that the assassin had worn. Okin hadn’t even noticed him take it off the man.

“Many of their members, even the higher-ups, wear these masks during... ceremonies. I found one taking place at the Cathedral ere Revictus some time ago. You will find a way into one of these gatherings and learn about their plans and where they are hiding the other texts of the Gods,” Ateon said.

“*Me?”* Okin shouted. 

“I am old and frail, and you know Aldwin much better than I do,” Ateon said. “I have hidden and failed for long enough and now, ironically, I am a coward. But you have proven to me you are not afraid of swimming against the tide. This is *your* mission now, Okin.

“You will find the last words of the Gods and complete the *Onorun.”*

Okin shivered. This--- this was all so much *responsibility*. This--- this could change the course of *Versalism* as Okin knew it.

But--- was there anything *wrong* with Versalism as it was? No, if the Gods had given men more of their Wisdom, it must be known. There was just so much *uncertainty.* 

But--- perhaps it was finally time for Okin to show his *true* Dedication to Justice and Bravery.

He glanced to Ateon’s outstretched hand. The lamp’s fire blazed in the small dark glass eyes of the mask. The empty eyes stared at Okin.

And just on the bottom of Ateon’s upturned palm, Okin saw them again. The two faded golden triangles of Justice and Bravery.

He took the mask by the beak and tugged it from Ateon’s hand.

He stood to his feet. He took one look at the mask, and then looked into the Darkness where he knew Ateon was standing.

“Yes. Yes I will.”
