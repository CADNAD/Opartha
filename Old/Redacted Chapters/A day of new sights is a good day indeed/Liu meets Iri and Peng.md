The thin man pushed open one of the back doors, holding it open for Liu to walk through. Exiting the building, Liu saw a wide field, with a stone brick path reaching out into a stone brick square, which had two other paths shooting out from itself horizontally. These paths led into two other buildings, one a tall, multi-levelled tower which looked almost like the lobby building stacked upon itself several times, with several outreaching red roofs and tall pillars which stretched through all four levels until hitting the final roof. It was quite an impressive building, and nothing like Liu had ever seen before. The other was very similar in style, although more massive both longitudinally and latitudinally, and only one story. 

“Follow me,” the clerk said as he walked along the forward path towards the centre square. Liu did as commanded, now studying the open range past the square.

There seemed to be no end to the outstretching field, which contained several strange contraptions; Battlements, wooden platforms, and several other towers sat in the distance, although these weren’t elegant and well-crafted like the two main buildings, they were makeshift and dull.

Reaching the square, the secretary turned right, now walking straight towards the one-story building. Liu followed, and the secretary opened one of the twin doors, once again allowing Liu inside before he himself entered. 

The large room was packed with people, some carrying wooden boards with food stacked on top, and others sat, eating at long tables. They were all boys, most around Liu’s age or slightly older, and they all dressed the same: a simplistic grey tunic with dark grey pants.

The secretary motioned for Liu to follow him, as he approached one of the four long tables. He spoke to a man at the head of the table, who stood out from the rest: he was several years older and bald, dressed in a bright red tunic with same golden accenting Liu had seen on the man who commanded the city guards. He glanced up from his meal at the clerk’s smiling face.

“Hello Commander Iri, we have a new recruit joining your training squad. This is Liu, he’s a native from Delmia,” the wiry man said. The other eight boys at the table stared at Liu as they stuffed their mouths.

The commander looked unimpressed. “Herald?”

“No,” the secretary replied. “But he is intent on serving in the Delmian state army.”

The commander grunted. “He probably just said that to get in.”

“I’m also considering joining the Imperial army,” Liu interjected. 

The commander looked up at Liu. “Yeah, see, that’s his real choice. Well, I don’t blame you, Imperial is high pressure, but much more glory.”

“I’m not very interested in glory,” Liu replied. “And I am still very interested in being an officer in the Delmian state army.”

“Well, if you claim you aren’t in it for glory- which I’m still not convinced, looking at your clothes, I would guess it’s for the money?” Iri said. The clerk stood awkwardly, staring up and away.

“No, I want to become an officer because I believe in the Empire and a united Delmia alongside it,” Liu replied, his eyes met with the commander’s.

“I’m about as convinced as if you told me a Darkie became the new leader of The Citadel,” Iri replied.

“Alright,” the clerk interrupted, the faux smile still ever-present. “Commander Iri, I recommend that you see Liu to his quarters as soon as possible.”

“And I recommend you get that giant Gaoleian battleship out of your ass,” Iri said, half-covering the words with snickers.

The smile flashed from the clerk’s face. “Commander Iri, that is highly inappropriate and unprofessional. How would you like if I reported that comment to Director Usan?”

Iri just snorted, his smile growing.

The secretary turned to Liu, trying to ignore Iri. “Well Liu, I hope you have a fulfilling and enlightening journey here at Delmian State academy for Military Officials.” 

The secretary turned away from the table, making a beeline for the exit. Liu stayed standing as the rest of the table continued to eat.

Finally, Iri looked up from his rice. “What are you doing? Go get some food,” he said to Liu. Liu nodded, and then looked around for any sign of said food. At the front of the room were several men in front of large pots, scooping out meals for hungry recruits.

Liu walked up to the line, grabbing one of the several wooden platters and a wooden spoon. Many of the recruits eyed him as he held out his board to be served, and the server looked at him with an aggressive eye.

“I’m a new recruit, just came in today. Commander Iri said I could get some food.”

The man grunted before shoving a spoonful of rice onto Liu’s plate. “Always Iri.” Liu left the line and returned to Iri’s table, sitting at an empty space on the opposite side of Iri. 

Most of the trainees ate in silence, some studying Liu as he sat down. Liu turned away from the prying eyes, instead facing forward as he ate. But that only drew his attention to an even stranger on-looker, a boy around his age with wide eyes and an even wider smile.

Noticing Liu’s stare, the boy opened his mouth. “Hi, my name is Peng Ren, what’s yours?” The boy offered a skinny hand.

Reluctantly, Liu reached forward, surprised by the boy’s firm shake. “My name is Liu.”

“Well, very nice to meet you, Liu,” Peng replied.

“Peng’s already trying to fuck the new recruit,” one of the boys, sitting to the right of Peng, remarked. He looked slightly older, although only by a year or so, and had short, black hair.

“Wouldn’t you like to watch,” Peng replied. Liu scratched his head at the comment.

The other boy turned his attention to Liu, eyeing the bruise under his left eye. “What are you, some kind of pig-fucker? How’d you even get into this school?”

“A very generous friend of my father’s sponsored me, along with a government Inspector,” Liu replied with lightning speed.

“A very generous friend of my father’s sponsored me, along with a government Inspector,” the boy mimicked Liu, highlighting the speed and monotony of his voice, causing a laugh from some of the other boys.

“Khan, I want to eat in quiet. I don’t want the pleasurable part of my day ruined by your annoying voices,” Iri said. 

“I apologize, Commander Iri,” Khan replied.

“Apology- not needed. Just shut up,” Iri replied. A smug smile came across Peng’s face.

After finishing their meal, Iri held the squad of boys outside of the meal hall. 

“Alright, since I apparently have to show Liu to the dorms, you guys have free time until bed,” Iri said to the group.

There was little reaction, apart from some smiles. 

“Well, Liu, c’mon,” Iri said, leading Liu towards the taller tower.

“Here’s the dorms,” Iri, said shoving open the door and walking through. Catching the door, Liu slipped inside. The place looked very similar to the lobby Liu had seen earlier, just slightly less dignified in every way; no paintings, a few bits of dust and grime on the floor, and only one potted plant. Still, it was opulent compared to the Liu’s old cabin. The lobby of this building was also much narrower, but longer; instead of just one side door for the director’s office, there were five doors on each side, each placed an equal distance to create symmetry, and on the back wall was another door.

“We’ll be going to the second floor,” the commander said, and he walked up a staircase placed next to the entrance, like the rest of the room it was symmetrical, one staircase on each side. It looked identical to the first floor.

Iri walked to the third room on the right and opened the door. “Here’s your room. I’ll get you clothes before nightfall,” Iri said. 

The room was quite barren and plain, but the floor, air and walls were much more sterile then Liu’s former bedrooms. The only furniture was a bunk bed and two wooden closets. 

“Well, it’s a free night,” the commander said, still holding the door open. “Get settled, do whatever you want, I’ll get you a change of clothes and be in bed by 20:00.” Liu nodded, and Iri closed the door behind him. 

Liu stood in silence. I can’t believe I’m here. But upon first glance, this is not exactly what I expected. Liu wondered if the commander’s training would be as unconventional as his demeanour was. 

Liu’s mind drifted off into fantasies of what the training would be like. Would it be a physical struggle? Maybe, but that was more indicative of training for enlisted soldiers, not commissioned officers. Would it just be endless reading, studying tactics and historical wars? Liu wouldn’t mind that as much.

Suddenly, Liu heard the banging of footsteps outside of the door. Cautiously turning, he was surprised to see that the door had been opened by a thinner boy whose face was covered by a large stack of grey clothes, matching his own.

“Can you close the door for me?” The boy said, and Liu did as asked. Squating down to place the clothes on the floor, Liu saw that the boy was the same one he had met at the dinner table, the one named Peng.

“Here are your clothes, Iri said these should be right. There’s only so many sizes, but I also think these’d be a good fit,” Peng said. “There’s also several undergarments tucked into the stack.”

Liu nodded, and then continued to stare at Peng’s childish grin.

After a few seconds, Peng asked, “Uhm, are you waiting for something?”

“May you please leave the room while I change?” Liu asked.

Peng chuckled. “Oh yes, sorry.” He exited the room and shut the door behind him. 

Liu took off his old farmhand’s clothes, underwear and all, and slipped on the grey uniform. As Peng had estimated, it fit well. Folding up his old farmhand’s clothes, he opened the drawer and placed them in the back, covering it up with the pile of identical uniforms.

After closing the closet, Liu re-opened the door and peeked out into the hallway, finding Peng patiently waiting, the friendly smile returning as he saw Liu. 

“Looks good!” Peng shouted.

“You can come back in now.”

Peng strode pass Liu into the room, and Liu shut the door behind them. 

“Well, I’m pretty excited to finally have a bunkmate! The nights get pretty boring sometimes, especially when I can’t sleep, which is quite often. That being said though,” Peng swung around to face Liu, his finger to the sky. “The top bunk is mine.”

“Okay,” Liu replied. What a strange request.

“I’m glad we have an understanding. I think this is going to be--- a great partnership.”

Somehow, Liu wasn’t as optimistic.
