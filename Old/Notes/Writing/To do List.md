\-IMPORTANT:

\-Possibly add scene of Okin returning to visiting complex late at night and Gendro asking what Okin was doing

\-Possibly tie-in more about Okin’s conflict regarding whether Synodontis is a real God

\-Create more things about Gods and intrigue to make Nexon and Revictus reveal cooler!

\-Add mention about Aldwin’s ring (cult ring) at the start--- (perhaps Okin knows about it from the *past)*

\-Announce Aldwin’s party/ball earlier--- perhaps in the chapter where Okin and Previa talk

\-Add scene to beginning: Wosa greets Synodontis who has a breakdown about the campaign and all the killing that has been going on before leaving the room, Wosa is greeted and sent a pre-recorded message by Aredal through the recently deceased culminating in “do not let them bring the Four together. Do not let them cross the boundary from death to life”

\-Change some of Nexon’s PTSD ramblings to Old Trentanian

\-Change some of Nexon’s ‘my friend’s to the Old Trentanian version

\-Add more mentions of the different ships and their GaoLeian origins in the Nexon parts

\-include more scenes with Control Heraldry limit so Billy vs Jerel doesn’t feel unprecedented

IMPORTANT:

\-Change all mentions of Allia’s eyes to silver

\-Find way to have bigger time gap between trade ship raid and finding the beast.

\-Change Billy’s reaction to Okin to hint at Aldwin’s decision to not help Billy

\-More links to Billy’s past

\-Training with Beryl, like Billy’s training with his dad with a sword

\-Synodontis: Trauma scenes like losing his gf that are hidden by Wosa

\-Okin has a conversation with Previa/Gendro regarding whether Versalism is ‘all made up’

\-Okin convinces Previa to let him into Aldwin’s house when Aldwin is away

\-Okin talks to Backuh one last time before meeting Previa


ALTERNATE:

Okin tells Aldwin that Previa helped him before







Liu watches game with Peng who tells him the objectives and what units do, and their costs etc.

Liu then hops in to play by himself but barely loses
