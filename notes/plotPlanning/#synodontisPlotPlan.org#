* Guidelines for this doc format
- For **, this means that this key beat occurs, and then
  everything grouped after it is all the beats/scenes that occur
  after it until the next beat begins. e.g: ** Midpoint will start
  with the first crucial beat (the midpoint itself), which are
  additionally marked with ! as a prefix, and then scenes which
  follow after. This is why Break into X is in Act X. The ! points
  of the last beat of the act are duplicated as the first beat of
  the next act to show continuity.
