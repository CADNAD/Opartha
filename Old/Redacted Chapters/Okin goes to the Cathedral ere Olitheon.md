Okin wiped the beads of sweat from his head.\[ comma, 2021-05-26 6:02 PM  
maybe delete this scene\] The Cathedral ere Olitheon was a \[describe Cathedral\] Even at this late hour, Athers rushed in and out of the library, books in hand.

The inside of the library was more decorated and refined than the outside; fancy lamps gave a warm glow illuminating the pleasant dark hickory bookshelves which lined the walls. There were several staircases which led the upper floors in the library, and craning his neck, Okin could see a massive chandelier several stories above. 

Directly in front of him stood three secretaries each sitting behind one long wooden desk, and behind them sat three more secretaries who faced the opposite direction. Two were already attending to other goers, but the vacant clerk waved for Okin to approach.

The man was thin and wore round spectacles, and a dark tunic with a light puffed collar. To his left sat a giant stack of papers, and in front of him was a sheet filled with dates, numbers and names, which he continued to fill. On his wrist were two black half-circles, with a space in the middle, the mark of a man who had shown his determination in Wisdom and Knowledge, two of the tenants of Olitheon.

“Hello, welcome to The Cathedral ere Olitheon. What is the purpose of your study today?” 

“I am---“, Okin stopped. Could he really tell this man what he was looking for? Anyone who remotely followed Moden Versalism and the teachings of The Citadel would know that there were only three books of Nexon, and plus, any High Ather like Okin would have several copies of the Moden Versalist Bible, which contained those three volumes. And surely a scholar hired by The Citadel at its most prestigious library would recognize both these facts. If not rejected, Okin would be at least ridiculed for such a silly inquiry. 

The clerk looked up at Okin, confused by the silence, and the High Ather finally continued. “I am looking for any information related to Dedication to Nexon.”

The clerk nodded.  “You will find all information related to Dedication on the third floor,” he replied. “If you need further assistance, just ask another dressed the same as I. There should be at least one on every floor."

Okin nodded, and the man continued to write.  The High Ather walked up the steep wooden staircase which curled around the circular tower. Reaching the third floor, he quickly found an assistant wearing the same dark tunic with the puffy white collar.

“How may I help you today?” The man asked.

“I need to find any information regarding Dedication to Nexon,” Okin said. “Preferably written by Nexon himself.”

The worker raised an eyebrow, scratching his head. “I believe that the only scripts written by Nexon himself are those in the bible, which I’m sure you’ve read time and time again. However, we do have a section on Dedications which were written by several different authors. You may follow me if you wish.”

Okin nodded, and the man led him to one of the many arched halls, containing bookshelves which reached up several levels. 

“Here it is,” the assistant said, gesturing. “Is there anything you are looking for in particular?”

For the first time since his arrival into the library, Okin answered completely truthfully. 

“I do not know.”

The assistant nodded. “I will leave you to it then. If you need any further assistance, don’t be afraid to ask.” Smiling, he turned on his heel and left Okin alone in front of the massive bookshelf.

Okin placed his finger on the row of book spines, scanning through the rows. Many of them didn’t contain a title on the spine, so Okin had to pull out those books individually and check the front for a title. Still, many of them bore blank covers, so Okin had to open and see the title printed on the page. There were hundreds of books that were dedicated to Dedication, and even though Okin had singled out a few shelves that were entirely focused on Dedication to Nexon, there were still several dozen to choose from.

*Being a good servant of Nexon. Nexon and the Joy of life. Dedicating oneself to Nexon.* Okin got little information out of the book from the title, so he opened one and started reading. Less then two pages in, Okin had seen nothing related to Nexon and the supposed Fourth Book. He flipped through the book; it was several hundred pages long. 

Stepping back, Okin realized what a futile task this was. There were nearly a hundred books related to this topic, and he could barely even read the titles of each one, much less think about whether each one would likely contain related the necessary information based entirely on the title, much less read through all of these books, which were unlikely to contain the information in the first place.

Okin shook his head, but then his eyes widened. He took out the crumpled piece of paper and re-read the last line.  

*Only he could pressure me to stand against him, only he knows my personality well enough to force my hand. Only my brother.*

Heart pounding, Okin scanned the spines of the books, going back to a previous row. His finger landed upon a spine that read: *Olitheon and Nexon: The Brotherly Bond.*

Since he was a child, Okin had been taught that the Gods Nexon and Olitheon were the prime example of the brotherly, and to a further extent, the familial connection. Yes, they had been vastly different in personality and demeanour, but the two let their differences complement instead of divide.\[ comma, 2021-05-17 6:34 PM

Perhaps include bible story here\]

But the wrinkled page of this supposed book implied otherwise. It was the only real information Okin had, and perhaps this book would confirm or deny his suspicions.

He took the book out from the shelf, and placed it under his right arm. Maybe this trip wouldn’t be a total waste of time. 

A thought flooded his mind as he approached the staircase to leave the third floor, seeing the smiling assistant who had directed him earlier.  

“Could you please direct me to the section on the history of The Four?” Okin asked.

The man shook his head. “Sorry, there is no such section. We do have a wide selection of books regarding the history of that era, though, if you would like.”

*How strange,* Okin thought. The Four were the most important and prominent Gods in the Versalist doctrine, and the only ones which one could Dedicate themselves too. Perhaps all the necessary information was really contained within the Versalist Bible. Okin had a pretty good idea of what each of the Four were like, especially his Dedication, which was to Aredal. He knew of their history and of all the feats which they performed to protect the people of the world from Tregale and the rest of the Fallen. Perhaps there really was no further information, it *was* almost a thousand years ago.

Okin nodded, and the man returned a smile. Book in hand, Okin made his way down the steps to one of the vacant clerks.

“I will be borrowing this book, *Olitheon and Nexon: The Brotherly Bond,*” Okin said.

The clerk started scribbling. “How long do you plan to keep this book?”

“Two days,” Okin said. 

The clerk continued writing. “And what is your name and Dedication? Where might you be stationed?” 

The High Ather showed the clerk his wrist and the shining star of Aredal that was drawn on it. My name is High Ather Okin, from Ariska. There is only one church there. Although, I am staying at the visiting complex during my time at The Citadel.”

The clerk nodded, and finished scribbling. “If you do not return the book within the set time, we will send a letter to your station and send Rothars to fetch it at the visiting complex. You may always come back if you’d wish to renew.”

Okin nodded, exiting the library through the wide stone archway. 

The formerly bustling city was now near dead as the sun had retreated past the horizon, leaving the sky in darkness. The only source of light were a few dim street lamps, the small shining stars in the sky, which were overshadowed by a much brighter one, illuminating The Four in the centre of the city.

Okin said a prayer to Aredal as he stared into the shining star upheld by his God.
