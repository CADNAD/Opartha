Okin rushed down the streets of The Citadel, arms wrapped around his own chest, his ribs aching from the bulk of the book hidden underneath his gambeson.

Still, the Ather smiled widely. 

He had gone to fetch the book from the beggar as soon as was humanly possible; his curiosity was unquenchable and his imagination spewed possibilities of what was inside the small tome long before he even read the first line.

Sneaking into his new residence with the key that the Devinar had given him. The other Rothars, including Gendro, were doing drills in the main hall, past the twin staircases which led to the upper floors where the meal hall and bedrooms were. Crouching down under the stone rail, he crept up the solid brick stairs on his tiptoes, speeding up as he reached the top floor. 

Okin ran to the dorm, a simple, grey room with a few large burning lamps in the corners and twelve steel-frame bed. Plopping down on a spare bed and hurriedly pulling the text out from underneath his puffy armour. It was a leather case book with no cover, small and in excellent condition. 

*I never knew there were forces so mystical in this world. I thought I had witnessed the extent of this world’s magic, spending my life with the most powerful and legendary figures that the world had to offer. But they were merely men. I thought I had faced the most dangerous and supernatural this world had to offer after our encounter with those strange, otherworldly creatures, those beasts. But fearsome as they were, they were still of this realm. What we have discovered today, it is not of this universe. It breaks all bounds that I ever knew.*

Okin re-read this beginning passage several times over, trying to match anything this writer said to his extensive knowledge. *Most powerful and legendary figures, but men? Who were the most powerful figures, beside the Gods? And what of these strange, otherworldly creatures?*

Okin had heard tales of massive, mythical monsters, but there was absolutely no evidence of their existence. If one of these truly world-shattering creatures were real, surely one of them would have been seen in Wreathward or Marthia and been recorded by scribes or historians. It was telling that the existence of these creatures was usually spouted by simple, drunken townsfolk of the rural areas Okin had visited. 

_But how old is this book? What if these creatures **were** real, but have all gone extinct or been defeated?_

That possibility seemed much more likely. And if it was true, then the fact of their existence was much less significant. 

*But what could have been more mind-bending than the existence of these so-called beasts?*

The questions and internal raving blew through Okin’s mind at every passage, and he had to re-read them several times in an effort to fully grasp the full picture of this small manuscript and its implications.

He was skimming over one of the middle pages for the second time when he heard stomping coming from outside the room. Frantically, he tore open the bedsheets, hiding the book underneath them, and then laid down ontop of the bed, the book underneath his back.

All dozen members of the squad entered the room, including the four Okin knew by name; Gendro, of course, Ashkar, the large Farsunian man, and the two twins from Northern Whenran, Dubli and Tawli. They all laid down on their own beds, the two twins on the far left, Ashkar in the rightmost corner and Gendro two to the left of him.

A man several times the size of Okin approached the bed. There was probably a ton of muscle packed under his gambeson, which looked far too tight, but it was covered by the layers of fat which spilled out from underneath the padded armour. 

“What are you doing?” The giant asked, his flabby chin flopping as he spoke.

“I-I was just---” 

“This is my bed,” the man said. “Get out.”

Okin carefully tried to reach his fingers underneath the covers, scrambling for the book.

“J-Just give me a second,” he said.

“No. Leave my bed,” the man grunted.

Okin’s fingers clutched the cover and he rapidly pulled it out from underneath the covers while standing up in a unified motion. 

Keeping the book behind his back, he scampered around the massive man who gave him a dirty eye.

“What was that?” The man asked, causing Okin to stop his escape at the bed’s foot.

“Just a personal possession,” Okin smiled meekly.

“What the fuck are you doing hiding things in my bed?” The giant man stomped towards Okin.

“I wasn’t,” Okin stammered. “I didn’t know it was yours. I thought it was---,”

Okin’s open jaw was disjointed as the blubbery, elephantine hand slammed into his face mid-sentence. The force of the blow sent him pummelling to the ground.

“HEY!” 

A bright, fleshy red covered his eyes as the stampede of footsteps shook his fallen body.
