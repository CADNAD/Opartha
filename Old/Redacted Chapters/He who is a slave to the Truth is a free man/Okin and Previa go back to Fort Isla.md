Going down the left side of the aisle, Okin jogged lightly to catch up with Previa, who was marching out of the church.  As they reached the entrance of the cathedral, Okin had finally gotten within speaking distance of Previa.

“Why are you so upset, my friend?”  Okin asked.

Previa turned to look at Okin, both men steadying to a halt. “You don’t get it?  Father always makes me do what he wants.  I just wanted to see home for a little while, and pay our respects, but for some reason I got to go off and do some chores at The Citadel.”

Wrapping his arm around Previa’s back, Okin gave him a friendly pat.  “Being summoned to The Citadel is a high honour.  The only time I got to go there was for my promotion ceremony.”

Like a child seeing into a window of a candy store, Previa’s eyes lit up.  “You think I am going to be inducted as a High Ather?”

Smiling at the excitedness of the guileless Previa, the thought of confirming the truthfulness of this wish, which may in fact be false, crossed Okin’s mind.  But instinctively he remembered one of the tenants of his own God, Aredal:  *Do not lie.  A man knows when he is lying.  An honest man knows that lying encompasses leaving out important information, or displaying something which may not be true as fact.  Do not meddle in anything of the sort.* 

Okin looked down and away from Previa.  “I’m not sure. It could be, but it is likely something else.” 

His childlike glimmer fading, Previa took a deep sigh.  “I guess I don’t really have a choice.”  

Giving him one last pat on the back, Okin walked forward with Previa down the polished stone steps of the cathedral.  Taking a deep breath of fresh air, Okin beamed at the sight of a town he’d always enjoyed.  As he took in the colourfully painted wooden houses, he was amazed by how they were all unique, yet strangely uniform. Okin loved that.  Everything about this town was practical, but artistic and novel.  The cobblestone roads were smooth and well-paved, still every inch was unique in pattern and shape.  

“You waiting for someone or something?” Okin was pulled out of his daydreaming by the voice of the carriage driver, his Rothar, Gendro. Previa and the Rothar already sat in the carriage.

“No, I was merely taking in the town," Okin said, giving a warm smile as he stepped up into the carriage.  

After the High Ather had gotten in, Gendro slapped the reins and the two horses pulled the carriage slowly along the cobble road.  Okin, still mesmerized by the charming town, gazed around, studying the river that bisected the northern part of the town, where the cobble road became a small bridge.  The crystal clear water of the river was bubbled by a large water wheel that was built adjacent to the bridge.  From the reflection in the river, Okin could see a blurry and ever-changing reflection of the bridge and one of the town’s food stores.

“Your father sure is lucky to work in such a wonderful town," Okin said.

“Luck has nothing to do with it," Previa replied.  “Dad and uncle worked together to make sure that a new cathedral was built here, that they would be stationed to.”

Raising an eyebrow, Okin asked, “Why not in Metheno?”

“I’m not sure," Previa replied.  “Maybe they just liked the town, like you.”  Looking away, Okin gave a drifting nod.  

*It seems that, in a way, everyone I knew as a child has left Metheno.  I wonder what it will be like upon my return?* 

Metheno was a small town, and like many small towns, did not do well when struck by tragedy.  Okin remembered the first seventeen years of his life, he was more pious and restrained than the other kids, but overall had a very normal childhood.  But after the tragedy, the town was never the same.  There were many that Okin never saw again, which he chalked up to nothing to allow the trauma to fade away from his conscience.  For the next ten years, all Okin thought about was scripture, and how to be the righteous in the eyes of the Gods.  

*No matter what, it’ll be good to return home, to see my family again.*

Feeling hair touch his arm, Okin turned to see Previa, who had fallen asleep and was now leaning against him.  With a wholesome chuckle, the Ather remained unmoved, allowing his friend to get some rest on the journey.

Finally, the two Athers had arrived back at their quarters, exhausted and hungry after the journey. Gendro parked the carriage in front of the stone church building.

“Now that was a long one, Previa," Okin said with a bright grin.

Previa looked at Okin, a bit confused of his apparent pleasure of stating the obvious, until the look of bright realization appeared on his face.  

“Ah, Okin. You always have to bust my balls," Previa said, the two men chuckled as they walked to their quarters.  If not for muscle memory, they would probably be stumbling around in the dark for a few minutes before reaching the door, but they had no trouble.  The small amount of sunlight illuminated the grey stone bricks of the church building, upon which the Ather’s quarters were attached.  The tall, stone pillars and dark red roofs made the church resemble a medieval garrison. 

Feeling around the iron door, Okin’s fingers finally slid over what he knew was the keyhole.  He prodded the key in the general area, finally it clicked and he opened the door.  Gendro moved inside, and but Okin was stopped by a tap on the shoulder from Previa.

“Okin," Previa said, and Okin turned his head so he could faintly make out Previa’s face.  “I thought about the possibilities on the ride, and I thought--- What if I don’t want to be a High Ather?”

*I don’t think you’re going to become one yet anyway*, Okin thought to himself, but he couldn’t say that--- or at least not that bluntly. Keeping Previa motivated was important, but maintaining the tenant of Truth--- which Okin had done so flawlessly since his initiation as an Ather--- was infinitely more vital. “You are still very young, Previa, and it takes a lot of effort and Dedication to become a High Ather. It *is* quite unlikely that that is the reason your father is summoning you to The Citadel, but it could be. But if it is, do not make the same mistake I did of doubting yourself. No matter if you are an Ather-in-training, or The Mouth of The Gods himself, what is truly important is your Dedication, *our* Dedication, to Truth, Justice, and Bravery,” Okin said, resting a hand on Previa’s shoulder. “Don’t be like I was, my friend. Be Brave.”

Previa smiled. “But you are an amazing inspiration, Okin. The other Athers say that you have never told a lie in your life.”

Okin looked down to the ground. “Yes. But recently I’ve realized that I’ve done quite little in the other aspects of my Dedication. It’s all about balance, Previa. A *true* follower of Aredal, especially one who leads the people as an Ather through example, well he must be the true form of Truth, Justice, *and* Bravery.”

The young Ather stared off into the distance, nodding. 

“Come, let us go inside, it is getting dark,” Okin said. Previa snapped to his senses, and the two men entered their chambers, Okin closing the door behind them.

Saying goodnight to Previa and Gendro, Okin sat in his room alone. He pulled up the sleeve of his white robe, rubbing a finger over the image of a small star which was tattooed on his left wrist.

*If only I had an opportunity, a path, so I could be practice what I preach--- and become a true symbol of Justice and Bravery.*
