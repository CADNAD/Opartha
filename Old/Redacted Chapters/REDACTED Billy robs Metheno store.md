“B-but how?” Damian asked.  “I thought they don’t take Apathasawian papers here.”

Turning to Damian, Billy’s eyes narrowed.  “I already told you.  The only option

is to take it.”  Turning away, he marched towards a small wooden building with an overhanging porch, ontop which sat a wooden sign with a rough engravement labelled “store.” Swatting the right side of his jacket away, Billy placed a firm hand around the grip of his revolver, finger coiling around the trigger.

“Wait, wait," Damian chased after Billy, placing a hand on his shoulder and turning the cowboy around so their gazes met, Billy’s quite enraged at this point.

“What!?”

“At least don’t use the gun, Billy.”

*It was always like Damian to complicate things, even when there was a clear-cut solution that presented itself,* Billy thought. Nothing was ever good enough for Damian- which was quite ironic as he came from nothing, and their life had been tough enough as it was.  Damian’s pleading eyes reminded Billy of a little dog that would wander around one of the saloons which he routined, begging for scraps of food or some water from drunken customers.  Shaken, ragged, and disheveled, one expect the dog would slurp up anything given to him, but he never once drank any of the alcoholic beverages which customers spilled or left unmonitored.  *How can one, with nothing, that the world had left to rot, be so picky?  So- moralistic?*

Right hand dropping to the floor, Billy gave Damian a short nod.  Wildly, he turned around and swung open the door of the building, the wooden door crashing against the opposite wall.  Inside, Billy saw several bottles of beer, wine, and spirits, all lined up on a shelf behind a long wooden counter, where an elderly man was bent over, cleaning up. 

“Sorry, we’re closing up now.  I’ll be happy to serve you at sunrise," the elderly man said, upon seeing Billy enter.  He was rather unphased by Billy’s outfit, at least compared to everyone else they’d run into so far.

Storming to the counter, Billy faced the elderly man, who looked so tired and docile that it hid his feeling of bewilderment.  

“I think you’ll serve me now.”

Sneaking in, Damian peeked through the doorway, spectating but avoiding the action.

“What are you talking about?  We should all be in our homes, it's past evening,” the old man said.

“Listen.  You’re gonna get me two of those bottles of whiskey, and four loaves of bread, or I’m gonna fucking bash your teeth in," Billy said, raising his arm and clenching his fist in front of the man.

The elderly man shook his head, his empty eyes staring at Billy with an open mouth.  “This is an ungodly action.  Threatening violence on an elderly man who has done nothing.”

“I don’t give a shit about your fucking Gods," Billy flew his arm in a right hook over the counter, and his fist made contact with the man’s temple, sending him tumbling to the ground.  The man was out cold.

“Billy- what the fuck?” Damian shouted, prompting Billy to turn around and face him.  “I thought there wasn’t gonna be any violence.”

“All you said was no guns.  Don’t give me that shit now," Billy replied.  “Grab some of that bread over there," Billy said, pointing to the corner of the store.  Climbing over the counter, stepping over the man’s unconscious body, Billy reached up to grab a bottle of whiskey, and placed it under his armpit.  Then he grabbed three more, until he had two bottles of whiskey tucked under each arm.

“Billy," Damian was holding the four loaves of bread in his hands, standing in front of the counter.  “Don’t you think that’s a little more than we need?”

“It’s all we have to drink for the next three days.  Two of the bottles are yours.”

“I don’t want any whiskey.”

Flaring his nostrils, Billy replied, “Why do you have to be so fucking picky?”

Leaving the store with full arms, Billy scanned the area.  His eyes landed back on the well between the intersecting paths, and he walked to it, placing the bottles down at the feet of the well.  He grasped the wooden handle on the side post of the well, and began turning clockwise until heard the *plop* of the bucket hit the water.  Changing directions, the bucket came up from the depths and he reached forward to grab it, and then placed it by his feet.  Sighing, Billy grabbed one of the bottles of whiskey, wrapping his thumb and index finger around the top half of the cork which stuck out of the bottleneck.  Pulling aggressively, the cork flew free from the bottle with a pop.

Sighing, Billy dumped out the bottle of whiskey on the ground, then proceeded to fill it up with water from the bucket.  “Drink up," he said, handing it to Damian.

“Thanks," Damian said, taking a sip from the bottle.
