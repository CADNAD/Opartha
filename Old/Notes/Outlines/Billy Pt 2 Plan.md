\- = chapter.

\-Billy has conversation with Allia where Allia gives him the gun, he kind of interrogates her but mostly just tells her to leave, thinks he’s making her think that he’s not a threat

\-Billy goes to Black Hole to voice his complaints, Billy sees Allia’s harsh training

\-Billy has dinner with everyone, meets Allia’s betrothed (who is a student underneath the guy Billy will train under later), sees Damian happy, is a bit grumpy but is gets convinced by everyone to do training

\-Billy does training for the first time and has a good time, learns some new skills with new weapons, has a better dinner with everyone and has some development with Allia where he finally admits to himself that she is not a manipulator\[ Might be bad to do dinner twice. Better setting possible
\]
\-Billy does training for the second time, this time his master offends him when trying to push him, saying something that triggers negative thoughts about Billy’s dad. Billy says “Fuck your Forces” (or something else that is sacrilegious), and then the Monastery prosecute Billy with a crime punishable by death. Benjamin and Damian stand by their friend, and get locked up (and presumably met with the same charges) as well.

A)-Allia once again, with the help of some friends (maybe Evelyn) breaks them out of the cell and then takes a Ytternu-pulled ship down to the coast. (Maybe explanation is that the Strait is too windy for Ytternus, idk)

B) The Monastery says the only way they can redeem Billy and subsequently Allia is if they find an Artifact, which they suspect to be in Krinosas.

A) Billy and the party hire a pirate ship to sail them across the Strait. Nexon’s ship raids the pirate ship, taking it over and taking them prisoner.

B) Pirates shoot down the Ytternu ship, and capture Billy and the party. Nexon’s ship raids the pirate ship, taking it over and taking them prisoner.

\-Nexon starts to befriend Billy. The others realize Nexon’s madness. Billy is starting to have fun and take a liking to Kiatus, but Benjamin and the others want to re-focus on the mission.

\-Hearing the Ytternu’s shrill and seeing the crash, the Anti-Party tracks down Nexon’s fleet to ask questions. Billy struggles with the decision of trading Allia in turn for getting the Monastery off their back, ultimately, Benjamin and Damian help convince him not to, and learning of Allia’s sacrifice (Jerel) cements his decision.

\-Nexon sees the Leviathi, who starts to rock the ship. The adrenaline junky, instead of steering the ship to safety, urge his Heralds and himself to attack the Beast. The ship is washed ashore, and the party narrowly escapes, but in two separate groups---  Billy with Allia, Damian with Benjamin.
