The doors pushed open again, and the jailer led the way, followed by the same two guards.

Between them, arms behind her back, Allia’s vicious eyes stared at the ground.

“Did I put an invisible drunk in there for you to fight? What’s up with all the screaming?” The jailer unlocked the door again.

Billy squinted. What was *she* doing here? Was this some kind of weird interrogation tactic? Why would they do that, when they were already so sure of his guilt?

They pushed her into the cell, her messy hair falling in front of her face, covering it completely. She didn’t even move as they shut the door directly behind her.

“Wait wait wait,” Billy stood up and placed his face in between the bars. “What is this? Why is she here?”

“Well you claim you’re not entirely responsible, that you didn’t choose to be here. Talked to some of the others, and apparently it’s kinda true. This the girl that brought you here, right?”

Allia was curled up in the corner of the cell, the back of her long hair facing Billy. Billy didn’t respond to the jailer, but that was response enough.

“What---what will happen to me?” Billy asked.

“Well, it’s hard to argue for anything other than execution when it comes to blasphemy, but maybe you’ll get a more respectful death then being fed to Kan or being thrown off his back,” the jailer said.

“And her?” 

“I don’t know, I don’t hand down the sentences, I just do the job,” the jailer replied. “Could be as bad as death too, though.”

Billy turned back to Allia, her arms tucked around her knees and only her back faced to him.

“Wait,” Billy said, and the jailer turned back, rolling his two differently-sized eyes. 

“What?”

“My brother. Does he---“

“Yes, we’ve already alerted both of the men that arrived at the island with you. They’ll be present at the trial later this evening, at least, if they are your friends,” the jailer said.

Billy nodded, and the jailer stared at him as if he were waiting for another inquiry.

“Well,” the jailer said after a few seconds of silence. “I hope you’re comfortable.”

With that, he left.

Billy leaned up against the bars, clicking his fingers against them, the imminence of death tap dancing in his mind. Allia stayed silent in the corner.

“Your people, they got some real crazy laws,” Billy said, leaning forward to gauge her reaction---which was non-existent. 

“Well, I was right,” Billy slid down the bars, taking a seat. “Should’ve trusted my gut.”

Allia still didn’t budge. Billy started to whistle.

*Maybe I was a little wrong about her, though,* a little voice in his head whistled along. The girl seemed to have shrunk into the corner even further. Could this really be an act?

“I-I-I didn’t know that they would do that,” Billy said. “I---I didn’t think they were that insane.”

Again, nothing.

Billy sighed, and slumped against the concrete floor. Part of him wanted the ugly jailer to come back and send him to his death already.

He shivered. Was *this* really how his life was going to end? He---he still hadn’t seen his father. His face glowered, and  memories---void of the light---shot back into his head. Memories of him, father, and Damian.

*Damian.* The boy would be doomed without him.  Billy glanced back to Allia, still shunned in the corner. The foolish girl had suggested earlier that Damian would be better off without Billy. No wonder she’d ended up in jail with him.

No, Damian would be fucked without Billy. Best-case scenario he’d end up a slave for this psycho cult, and then they’d expend of him. But most likely he’d end up dead long before that, a byproduct of his cowardice.

Part of him regretted being so protective of Damian over the past five years, as it had turned the already shy boy into a fearful dog. He grimaced. Maybe that’s what Allia was trying to say.

She sure wasn’t good at communicating it, though. In fact, she seemed to always be a bundle of emotions, which all struck back into Billy’s mind. Her unsettling smirks and grins when breaking them out of jail. Her feral eyes and stance when fighting off the Rothars back in Metheno.  Her tears and pleading when dealing with her master. Even the infrequent smile which she had shown at the campfire, which was, he had to be honest, quite nice.

“Hey,” Billy glanced back to her hair-covered back. “Maybe I shouldn’tve been so controlling over Damian.”

Her neck turned, ever so slowly, and though he couldn’t see hers, she eyed him through her curtain of hair.
