A smug look came across Aldwin’s face as the crowd cheered at the dead, swinging Ather.

It quickly disappeared as his eyes met Okin’s in the middle of the raving pit, just a few heads away from the stage.

Okin’s heart dropped.

He turned without hesitation, pushing through the crowd and ducking under waving arms and shouting faces. Women cursed and men kicked, but he continued to charge through the crowd without looking back.

Okin fell to the ground on both hands, and began crawling through the mob, the kicks to his back still throbbing even through his gambeson armour. It seemed as if he was swimming against a violent riptide; the crowd would never end and the onslaught of dust and dirt that flew in his face sinked into his lungs.  His breaths and coughs became indistinguishable, but he did not stand for fear that Aldwin’s men were right on his tail, that they would spot him and his fate would be the same as Breslo’s. 

A filthy sandal skyrocketed into Okin’s cheek, the force knocking his entire body onto the ground, his right cheek tore against the rugged road and his eye was blinded by the grimy mud. But he continued to crawl forward like a rabid dog, for he could finally see gaps in the legs where that weren’t just layered in front of other legs.

Reaching up to rub the dirt out of his eye with the back of his hand, he continued to trudge forward, crawling in between widespread legs and under the arms of parents holding their children’s hands. He began to claw his way forward like a maniac as he finally reached the outskirts of the massive gathering.

He looked behind himself around at the edge of the crowd; there were no Rothars or Devinars in sight. Frantically he pushed himself off the floor, sprinting away as fast as he could. His knee aching, he began to limp as he turned down a familiar street just past the marketplace. 



As usual, the alley was bare, which was a relief to him now more than ever. He blew into the small crevice between the two houses, slamming his back against the wall as he came to a stop. His heart punched his ribs over and over, trying to break free, and hunched over, hacking loads of dirt and grime out of his throat.

His stomach lurched forward, and he belched a chunky mix of what used to be stewy potatoes onto the ground below.

“How’d you feel if I came in and threw up all over your house?”

Still panting, Okin turned to see the beggar holding the pot lid over his head, his body still half submerged in the hole.

“Well, what do I owe the pleasure?” The beggar said. 

For once, the Ather looked even filthier then the vagabond, but he stood above him confidently, pointing a bitter finger towards the bearded hobo.

“I-I-I’ve come here to hide,” Okin said. “But more importantly, I’ve come here to tell you that I’m taking that accursed scroll and I are never going to cross paths again. I’m just going to head back to Ariska, or--- I-I---”

“What *will* you do, Okin?” The beggar asked.

Okin clasped both hands on his temples. The image of laughing children, sitting in a circle as he preached to him about the selfless acts of the Gods jumped in, and then quickly disappeared from his mind. His life as an Ather--- the life he loved, was no longer in jeopardy. It was merely over.

“There--- there is nothing! I cannot return that stupid book, no, those maniacs will still just stab two spears through my neck just like him!” The Ather paced back and forth, squeezing his head tighter. The guilt of his role in Breslo’s death was only overshadowed by the primal fear that consumed him. “And Aldwin, oh, he must think I’m part of this cult and be trying to kill me! I have to go, but I can’t head back to Ariska, or I will surely be killed all the same! What kind of Justice is this? Oh, Aredal, why is this happening?”

The beggar quietly set the lid down on the ground next to the pothole, and climbed out completely. 

“Okin, Okin, calm down! We are far from hopeless. In fact, this just very well goes to show that we have the upper hand,” the vagabond said. 

“H-How!?” Okin sputtered.

The beggar placed a finger between his lips, silencing the Ather. “I imagine that they have shown you a great deal of force, judging by your, well, *new look*. That means they are afraid! And I’m guessing all that rabble that I was hearing had something to do with it,” the beggar scratched his chin. “A public execution, I assume?”

Okin nodded wildly. “They will burn me at the stake just the same!”

“Only if they catch you, which they won’t. They are desperate, and desperate men often wander aimlessly,” the vagabond chuckled. “I know that all too well.”

“ENOUGH!” Okin screamed, his throat convulsing and his voice snapping as he held the yell. 

The Ather panted as he glared at the beggar, who stood like a statue.

“Come on, I heard something over here,” Okin heard chatter from beyond the alley and the several rows of heavy footsteps.

The beggar motioned silently with one hand for Okin to come closer disappearing down the hole, and the Ather sneaked in, carefully pulling the lid over the ladder. 

A vein popped in his head as he waited nervously, heart pounding.

The potted rattled against Okin’s scalp as the stomping came to a stop. There was silence for a few seconds.

“There’s nothing here. It must’ve just been a shout from the streets.”

The ceiling shook again as the intruders from above continued on their way.

After some time, Okin lifted the iron lid with his head just a little to see if anyone was still there. The path was clear.

“Desperate men are also often prone to anger,” the beggar chuckled from the bottom from the ladder, and Okin shot a glare downwards into the darkness, which his eyes began adjusting too rapidly.

“Come down, Okin,” the vagrant said. “We can discuss here much more comfortably, and you can shout at me all you want without worry.”

“I said I do not want to take part in this anymore. I have seen what is in store for me if I keep moving forward, and there is nothing to discuss,” Okin shouted downwards. “I don’t know where I am to go, but it is definitely *not* the direction I’ve been heading.”

There was no sign of the beggar below even as Okin’s eyes began to pierce the darkness. He waited in utter confusion until the other man finally lit a candle down below, the dim light revealing the entire plain, concrete room.

“Ah, it’s nice to have some light, even if it’s not so bright,” the vagabond chuckled, sitting down criss-crossed on one of the two thin mats that Okin had slept on not so long ago. “Speaking of Light, I wonder what your God would think, seeing you back away from fear.”

Okin flustered, his head still turned to face the bearded man as he made his way down the ladder.

“I believe you told me once that you wanted to be Brave,” the beggar said. “Well, the opportunity has presented itself.”

“B-but,” Okin stammered, standing over the vacant mat which faced the beggar. “Even if I decide that I want to stay, this all goes so beyond me. It’s nothing but confusion and fear, all in an effort to get more questions.”

“But we have found so many answers already.”

“I don’t have any real answers.”

“Really? I would think someone as clever as yourself would be able to piece such simple things together,” the beggar laughed.

“What is there to piece together?” Okin asked, gesticulating wildly.

“Take a seat, Okin. I’m sure we can work through any questions you have together,” the beggar replied, gesturing to the mat in front of them.

Okin reluctantly sat down, awkwardly crossing his legs in an attempt to mirror the beggar’s position.

*I don’t even know where to begin.*

“So, why don’t we talk about this *Aldwin*,” the beggar started.

“I--- I knew him since I was born. I always knew I wanted to be an Ather, and he taught me the most valuable lessons from a young age. I was almost like an older brother to his only son, Previa, who he actually never really approved of. But he has only ever been supportive of me, but now--- well, I’m not sure.” Okin’s teeth chattered. “I believe he may want to kill me.”

The vagabond let out a hoarse laugh. “Well, that escalated quickly. But what does this Aldwin actually want?”

“I---,” Okin rubbed his chin. What did Aldwin want? He didn’t want Okin to be in The Citadel, that was for sure. But why? It had something to do with Billy, right? He had thought about it for hours during sleepless nights, but it was always a dead end. 

Aldwin... he knew what he was saying in that speech. *There are still others out there, but we will find them,* he had said. He could see the predatory look on his mentor’s face when their eyes locked. That speech wasn’t just about Breslo.  

*But it was Breslo who ended up with two spears through his neck.*

Aldwin--- he must’ve known about the strange cult which Bristle was apart of. Did he--- did he really think Okin was apart of that cult as well?

“*Well?*” The beggar’s entire scruffy beard structure raised along with his eyebrow.

“He wants me out of here. I think he is trying to take down that cult that we---“

The image of Breslo’s panicked face flashed, and Okin remembered a similar fright from the High Ather that day when he had come to tell him of the ‘gathering’s’ cancellation. Okin’s lips curled downwards; Breslo may have been hiding in the shadows, but Okin knew that the man was not purely evil, and it was Okin’s own fault the man was now dead. Could that ever be forgiven?

Breslo had told someone that he directed Okin away, that he did what was asked of him, and the other nameless Athers had suggested murdering Okin. But they had mentioned someone who commanded against it, *the Harbinger.* They said they were to focus on the election---

Okin jumped up from his sitting position, clutching his head as his jaw dropped to the floor. “Aldwin isn’t trying to get rid of the cult! He is the leader! *The Harbinger!* He--- he’s doing all this to get Previa elected!”

*But why? Sure, Aldwin could manipulate Previa and have extra votes, but for what purpose?*

The vagrant stayed in a stoic position, not even watching as Okin paced furiously. 

“How could I be so blind? Oh, Aredal, the man I thought of as a second father has kept secrets and maimed and murdered! Why--- it must’ve been, he even sent men to beat his own son! Yes! Those masked men, that were sent to murder me, and would have if not for Gendro! It was him all this time!” Okin kneeled against the rough concrete floor, tugging on his hair. “Oh, by the Four, I am never going to be able to live safely as an Ather again!”

His eyes began to well as he realized his definitive fate. It was fitting that he discovered it in an empty, underground concrete box, as he would likely have to hole up in a place like this forever. He fell to the floor face first, his nose only protected by the hands which absorbed his tears, and his hands only protected by the thin blanket which he was sitting on previously.

He weeped, then he cried, then he sobbed, and then he wailed. His world had been broken by his own damned attempt to prove his Dedication to his God. 

Finally, his bawling came to a close, but he was still hunched over, his forehead pressed into the mat. The silence was broken by the sound of--- clapping.

Okin looked up from his hands, his eyes still red and wet. He wiped away the blurry tears. The beggar was standing above him, continuing his applause.

“Why are you clapping? Are you that sick that *this* brings you joy?” Okin wretched.

“Of course it does! You *did* it, Okin! You didn’t even need my help,” the edges of the vagabond’s beard lifted in a smile. “You figured out your own answers, and now you know what you need to do!”

“What---,” Okin sniffled. “All I figured out is that I am going to be killed by someone I thought I trusted, and that there is no Justice.”

“Well, not yet,” the beggar said. “Not unless you take action, that is.”

“But what am I going to do? I can’t even vote anymore!”

The vagrant let out a long chuckle.

“Well, you are saying that they will do anything to get this Previa elected. So you must do anything and everything to make sure he *doesn’t.”*
