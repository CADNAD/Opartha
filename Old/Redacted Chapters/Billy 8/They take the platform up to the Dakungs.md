Banuro was built inside, not into, the mountain. Rather than being a series of tunnels dug through the mountain, the city was centred around a central shaft which was almost a kilometre wide. The entrance Avador had opened had led onto a stone walkway, which lined the outer rim of the central shaft. The walkways rose both above and below him at semi-regular intervals. In the centre of the shaft sat a smaller column . Unlike the rest of the stone walkways, this one seemed to be made of stone bricks rather than grown from the earth itself. This central column had four equally spaced arch-shaped entrance ways, which connected to the outer walkway through even more stone walkways, these having the same ‘grown’ feeling that much of the stone of Meridaz had, as if it had been pulled from clay, rather than set with masonry. 

Tentatively, Billy grabbed a hold of the railing and leaned over the side of the outer walkway. Up above, a shaft extended up to what must have been the peak of the mountain. It was when he looked down over the side that he truly took in the scale of the city. Below, the shaft extended down into a vast cavern. Held up by earthwork pillars \[ 2021-02-16, 5:22 PM

What are earthwork pillars?\]at regular intervals the cavern expanded far beyond what Billy could see, flickers of lamp light crowding even the farthest of what he could see. 

To his side, Damian had done the same, and was visibly shocked. *So much for keeping out wits about us*, he thought. 

“Billy, this is---“

“Amazing, isn’t it?” Allia said. The girl made her way behind Billy to lean on the railing next to Damian. “This is Banuro, the secret city.” 

The city wasn’t the only secret around these parts*.* This place, their goals, he even had to pry Allia’s damned name out of her.

“So, what are we even here to do?” Billy said.

“Speak to the Dakungs, see if they’ll accept you.” Avador leaned his back agains the rail, throwing his head to look up. 

“And who are they?”Billy asked 

“Don’t speak Delmian?” Avador leaned forward.

Billy shook his head in response.

“Means lord. They run the place kid, anything you want they can get it for you, and you want to do anything? It’ll go through them at some point.” Avador pointed his finger upwards, toward the roof of the cavernous opening. “They spend most their time up there, ya see. So we gonna find em and see what they think of you three.” 

To his right, Allia sighed, and the girl frowned at Avador. At least someone here was giving him some clear answers.

“So they no like us, we cinked?” Benjamin said. 

Allia and Avador nodded silently. “However, that will not happen. I won’t allow it.” Allia turned to face the three, and Billy was stricken by the sense of fatality that surrounded her. Her expression carried a grim air to it, as if formed of harsh stone. The roundness of her face pulled taught to bring out sharp angles. 

“Yeah, if they don’t like you then you’re in the hole,” Avador pushed himself off the railing. “Let’s go then? They’ll make you wait, so ain’t no sense in stalling.” 

“I suppose,” Allia said. 

“So, how do we get up there? Seems like a long hike,” Damian said. The youth gripped the railing tight, peering high above him. 

“Hike? Oh, you’re in for a treat kid,” Avador let out hearty chuckle before pointing towards the stone coloum at the centre of the open shaft. “You’re gonna take that up.”

Billy shot the man confused look, “they got a ladder in there? A long ass spiral staircase?” 

“Neither, we u-“ for once, Allia opened her mouth to answer his question but was cut off by Avador.

“Best they see for themselves, follow me kids. You’re in for a good old treat.” 

Avador rounded the outer walkway till he crossed over onto one of the thinner walkways which led to the centre. The connecting walkway was around two meters wide and seemed far more stable than anything of its size and length should be. Tentatively, Billy stepped onto the connecting walkway and followed Avador towards the stonework column at the centre of the vast shaft. 

A large stone bulged out to frame the opening. On the frame, engravings of scenes that Billy didn’t recognize snaked through the stone. Some depicted battles, while other depicted scenes like a ship sailing into the distance, or a model of their solar system. Inside the column were four circular areas, fenced off by a metal railing. Each area sat in-between two of the equally spaced entrances, which gave the room a comforting symmetry. The two areas nearest opened up to reveal that--- much like the main shaft---the column stretched to the deepest depths of this place. On the opposite side of the room, the two circular areas seemed to be filled in. Within the two fenced areas, the floor was made up of a glossy white material, as opposed to the grey stone which composed the rest of the column. 

“Welcome to The Well,” Avador held his hands apart, slowly spinning as he entered the centre of the room. “This is what connects everything in this place. You wanna get anywhere, you go through here.” 

“And how exactly do we get anywhere?” Billy said.

Avador smiled, then pointed towards the roof. Billy followed his gaze and notice that for the first time since entering Banuro, he felt confined. While the roof rose several meters above, it was claustrophobic compared to the outer shaft. In the roof above, there were four circles that were perfect above the four fenced areas Billy had noticed earlier. 

“We fly, kid.”

“Fly?” Damian said excitedly. The teen hurried to Billy side, stumbling over himself. “We get to fly?” 

“That you do kid,” Avador turned to face the right most fenced area, the one that had that strange glossy flooring. “Here, I’ll show ya.” 

Avador flashed them a smile before turning to the rightmost fenced area. 

“Evelyn?” Allia said quietly. 

“Evelyn!” Avador called out to a women who leaned against the wall near the fenced area. She wore the same outfit as Avador. Tight dress-like bottom, and billowing robe-like torso. Unlike Avador, the new woman’s outfit was coloured navy blue, with a golden trim along the cuffs and hem of the bottom. A colour of gold which matched the woman’s silky waist length hair, which contrasted with her hawkish but rather beautiful face.

“Avador. Do I see correctly, is that Allia herself?” Evelyn pushed off the wall and began stalk over. “And what gift have the Forces brought to me this day?” 

“It is,” Allia said. “I... I brought them, they’re to see the Dakungs immediately.” 

Evelyn raised a thin golden eyebrow, “you do know, they are quite busy these days.” 

“She knows, kid practically begged me to take her.”

Evelyn scoffed at Avador’s comment, “What a gift that would have been to witness.” 

Allia clenched her hand into a fist, silently taking Eveyln’s torrent. “Well, she insisted, and I relented. What’s the worst that can happen? They’ll wait a while, an hour, maybe two, then they’ll give her an audience.” 

“Of course they will,” Evelyn rolled her eyes. “Forces be damned, they did always like her.”

“I’m right here!” Allia finally called out. She took a step towards Evelyn, who stood a good two inches taller than her. “Bring us up, and I shall see to the rest.” 

“Fine, it shall be done. However, those three haven’t used the well before, have they?” Evelyn pointed past the shorter girl towards Billy, Damian and Benjamin. All shook their head, and a tight lipped smile grew on Evelyn’s face. 

“The first time is always the most fun,” she winked before sauntering back towards the railing which create the fenced off area. She ran her hand along the railing before deftly jumping it. “There is the gate, but I find that terribly boring.” 

Allia took a few extra steps, before pushing open a small gate. Damian and Benjamin both followed Allia, while Billy elected to hop the fence after Evelyn’s example.

“Forces gift me, at the least one of you isn’t exceedingly dull.” Allia shot Evelyn a glare at the comment, and the taller girl shrugged. Were Avador and Evelyn the odd ones out for being so lax, or was Allia simply an uptight snob, even amongst her own people?

Billy reluctantly stepped onto the glossy white disk. A collection of handholds rose out of he surface, with a large grid like construction rising about a meter up in the centre. In total the disc couldn’t have been larger than two and a half metres in diameter.  In fact, crowding six people onto the disc seemed nearly too many. 

Both Avador and Allia had sat down and were each holing one of the handholds. “It would be best if you sit. I would rather not have to deal with any accidents today.” 

Evelyn gestured to a handhold, and Billy sat, gripping the smooth outcropping. Damian followed. Benjamin, waited a moment longer before finally following his friends.

“What is this?” with a free hand Benjamin pointed to the glossy white surface they were sitting on.

“That is for me to know, and for you to find out. Everyone holding on tight?” 

“I detest this,” Allia said quietly as the girl shut her eyes tight, her knuckles whitening. 

“I shall take that as confirmation. To the top we go then,” Evelyn turned her eyes to look up the circular opening above them which seemed to go through multiple floors above them. She inhaled deeply, splaying her fingers, and under Billy the glossy white surface began to rumble. A low tone rung out and the previously white surface began to glow as if surrounded by a deep violent gel. The platform shot up, forcefully pushing against Billy. His stomach rose and nausea washed over him as they passed floor after floor. He was completely lost in the moment, and had no idea how fast they were moving.

Though Billy’s body was stricken with panic, Benjamin was yelling out in excitement. The usually stoic man started cheering. With an arm held high above his bald head, his screams were almost lost to the wind. The whipping wind forced his body to acknowledge the inhuman way in which he was moving. He thought this might have been flight, but seeing Evelyn hover meters above them, he realized this was nothing but a pale imitation of the freedom of flight. The platform rose floor after floor, building up a pressure in his ear drums. The pressure mounted, the winds mounted, the disorientation mounted, till he slowed. His body lurched the sudden deceleration throwing him forwards over his knees. Slowly the platform came to a stop at the end of a hallway. A high arched sealing was supported by arches at regular intervals, each with drawing that seemed to imitate the ones he had seen below. 

“That was great!” Benjamin scrambled to his feet running over to Evelyn. “This, can you teach?” 

Evelyn chuckled, waving him off. “Well, that’s dependant on the Dakungs. Perhaps, if you stay, we can make the proper arrangements.” 

Their two voices seemed muffled to Billy, as if they were speaking through thick cloths. 

“Open your jaw, kid,” Avador made a loud yawning motion, pointing to himself. \[ 2021-02-16, 5:38 PM

This is a great detail!\]Billy followed, and in an instant sound return to the world around him. “Always a little strange the first time, Forces damn me but I hated this the first time. Still do, not as much as she does though.” 

Avador jerked his head to the side, where Damian was helping a shaky Allia to her feet. The girl really did fail to have any consistency to her. She was fearless and powerful in combat, but ever so shy and coy in conversation. Everyone had an angle, he just had to find hers. 

“Well, I wish you all great luck. I will wait here to ferry you back down. However, I would prefer to not step foot in that chamber.” Evelyn held out a lanky finger towards a set of wooden double doors at the end of the large hallway.

“I would too, but I gotta go and explain that the kid made me take her,” Avador crossed his right arm to the right shoulder in a salute towards Evelyn. The woman returned the salute. 

“Come on kids, let’s get this over with. Maybe they’ll even give me the day off, only the Forces know.” Avador turned on his heel and began to stride down the corridor. Allia followed quickly after with Damian on her tail. Billy followed after as Benjamin stared at the platform they had been flown up on. 

Billy stepped back and tugged on his friend’s shirt, and Benjamin turned with a grunt. “Amazing. Never thought I see technique like that. So much power, majesty.” 

“The platform?” Billy asked his friend.

Benjamin nodded his bald head in reply, “Yes. Amazing. I never think someone can do thing like this. That much power.” 

“Yeah, it’s terrifying,” Billy said.

His friend shook his head vehemently, “Not terrifying, amazing.” 

*Same difference,* Billy thought to himself, but he knew there was no use arguing. Benjamin had his mind made up, and it wasn’t often one could change that. 

The double wooden doors were engraved with similar patterns to the ones Billy had seen earlier. Avador pulled a large iron ring off the door and let it down in a resonant *thump* sound. The doors parted to reveal a circular antechamber with a significantly lower roof than the main hallway. A man stood in the door way, flanked by two other men in padded armour; which was of a Marthian style, with padded sheets strung together in larger sections to cover the body, yet remain light. 

“Chowondo Avador? Kadonsong Allia?” The central man was dressed like Avador and Evelyn had been, with his outfit being dyed a deep black with gold trim and gold knotted belt. He was a short man, with a rounded face and bald head. His eyes bulged at seeing the two, yet his voice reminded calm. 

“I see you brought candidates?” The man leaned past Avador to look the three over. “These seem acceptable. A halfway decent haul for a woman of your reputation.”

“So, may I see the Dakungs? I require their immediate evaluation.”  Allia stepped infront of Avador.

The short man stroked his chin, “I suppose you may. The matter at hand is of little importance. Come in, I shall announce your arrival.” 

Allia gave the man a slight bow, shallower than the one she had given Avador. She gestured them in and Billy followed silently. Behind them the double doors closed, at the same time that the set in front opened. Beyond the forwards set of double doors was  a circular room with a high domed ceiling. A five point star lay engraved onto the floor of the room, and on each pointed was a gaudy, high back chair, padded with brown cushioning they resembled a discoloured throne more than a sitting chair. Each chair was atop a raised platform nearly two meters, and on the wall behind each chair a floor-t0-ceiling window let in copious amounts of light. Each chair was occupied by what would presumably be the Dakungs. 

“Dakungs! Kadonsong Allia has brought candidates for evaluation.” The short man stepped aside and bowed Allia into the room. 

“Ah, Allia. So you have returned.”
