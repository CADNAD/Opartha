“So is that thing really a Summon?” In the corner, it stirred. Its all too intelligent eyes snapped up to Damian. If the thing *was* a Summon, then it only opened a flood of new questions. A flood which Damian was far from to tide. 

“Well, summons are a complicated matter kid.” Avador scrapped his chair along the wooden floor as he stood. In his night garment the man looked half a decade older, and half a human fatter. 

“You’re not stupid, so I assume you know how each Tree works?” 

Damian slowly nodded. Mind, Summons, and Stealth, the three arms of evil--- or so he had been taught.

“So you know that most people can only manifest one Tree?” Avador barely paused to let Damian nod. “So even if this thing is a Summon, I’m not yet sure if it’s *your* summon.” 

Then whose Summon was it? If someone had used Mind Heraldry, then the dream could have been an implant. The idea made Damian draw his knees up on the chair.

“And if it’s not mine, the who’s it?” Damian asked.

“I don’t know kid. I don’t know.” Avador picked up the light from the table, and began to walk to towards the thing in the corner. 

“But I really doubt someone would go through all this trouble for you.” The older man turned to Damian, his eyes bore into him.

“If someone’s after me, then I have no idea who. Well, no one who would use Dark Heralds.”

“Listen Kid, I don’t care what you used to do. I need to know, for your own good if someone would go through all this trouble just to get to you.”    
	Damian shook his head, it was the truth after all. Thought he loathed to admit the fact, the Citadel considered him a fugitive. But, they would never use Dark Heralds, even if it meant defeating Tregale himself.  
	Avador raised a hand to cup his chin. “Well, if what you say is true then this has to be the rouge work of some other Herald. Does your room have a window?”   
	Again, Damian shook his head, “no other entrances either. The door was closed when I woke up, and the living room outside didn’t seem disturbed either.” 

That part was a lie, but only a small one. The shared living space had been in a state of dissarry since the first day Benjamin and himself had left Billy alone. But, the empty bottles and sprawled furniture looked the same as it had when Damian had gone to bed. 

“So there’s no way it could have gotten in,” Avador’s eyes narrowed as they locked onto Damian. “Tell the thing to come over her.”   
	“Why?” Damian asked, surprise clear in his voice. 

“Just do it.” 

Damian bit down on his lip in consideration. He barely wanted to think about that *thing,* let alone command it
