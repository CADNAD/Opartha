The large keep was one of the only gated properties in The Citadel.  It was in the middle ring, as close as could be to the centre Cathedrals without actually being in the centre.  The mansion was made of red bricks and had lots of windows, making it look quite out of place from the rest of the nearby structures which were made of the square stone bricks and looked all resembled castles.  

The small yard, which would have been unimpressive by most mansion standards, was actually the first non-agricultural greenery Okin had seen in The Citadel.  Most of the properties were quite squished together, and any sort of yard was a rarity.  Aldwin’s mansion was the first that somewhat resembled a wealthy estate from outside of The Citadel. Of course he wouldn’t be the only one with mansions like this. The Ducéres and other powerful houses would likely have comparable, if not more impressive mansions. Though the classic styling of the building spoke to the history that this family carried.

“Here we are,” the Devinar said, dismounting.  Okin and Gendro followed him through the yard to Aldwin’s front door.

The Devinar knocked, and soon enough the door was opened.  

Aldwin looked quite disgruntled that someone would come knocking at one of his family homes, but his grumpiness changed to confusion as Okin stepped up from behind the armoured Devinar.

“Okin? What is the meaning of this?” Aldwin asked, ignoring the Devinar completely.

“Impalias Aldwin,” Okin said, bowing his head.  “I have extremely crucial information to tell you.”

Aldwin remained puzzled.  “You’re supposed to be back in Ariska.  How did you get here?”

“Rothar Gendro and I traveled as fast as we could from Metheno.  This information is extremely time-contingent,” Okin said.

Aldwin frowned.  “Well, come in then,” he said, and Okin and Gendro walked forward.  “Not you, Rothar.  Devinar Peter, take him to one of the visiting complexes.  I’ll give Okin the directions to reach him once we are finished.”

The armoured man nodded, and took a frustrated Gendro by the arm.  Aldwin closed the door.

“So, what is the news?”
