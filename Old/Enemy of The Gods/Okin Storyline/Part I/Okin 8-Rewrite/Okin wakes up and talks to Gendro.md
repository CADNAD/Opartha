“Uergghhh...,” Okin groaned. He felt soft cotton encapsulating his body, but it still ached. His vision faded in... 

“Okin! Okin! You’re awake. Finally.”

Gendro smiled. He set down a hand-held lamp and book.

Okin slid up and palmed around. Yep, this was definitely his bed.

“I tried to wake you up, but you were just mumbling nonsense. I thought it would be Rothar-ly of me to carry you like a baby back to bed. I even changed your undergarments\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-26 10:03 AM

Perhaps Okin would havea problem with Gendro’s jokes as they technically aren’t true\],” Gendro joked.

“What--- what am I---,” Okin stuttered. “What time is it?”

“Eh, a little before noon, I suppose,” Gendro said as he looked out the window, which let in some dim light.

Okin threw off the covers and jumped out of the bed. 

“Woah, woah,” Gendro stood up. “Where are you going?”

“I need to see Impalias Aldwin as soon as possible! 

Gendro walked around the bed to Okin. 

“Okin, Okin, you look worse than my grandfather then when we found him dead on the road with his eyes plucked out by crows,” Gendro said. “To be fair, you look worse than that on a normal day, but *today---“*

“Gendro!” Okin turned to the Rothar and gave a dead-eyed stare. “I have to go now.”

Okin turned for the door, but Gendro pulled him back.

“Wait! What is going on, Okin? You’re out all day, you clearly haven’t gotten any sleep--- what’s so important?”

“I--- I don’t have time to explain now, Gendro,” Okin rubbed the Rothar’s shoulder. “I promise I’ll tell me as soon as I can.”

Okin pulled away for a second time, but Gendro spoke up again.

“Wait! Let me go with you, Okin. It’s--- it’s my duty as a Rothar, isn’t it?” Gendro smirked.

Okin’s jaw dropped a little in his mouth. *Gendro* wanted to come along? *Gendro* wanted to actually do his job? 

He was somewhat *proud* that the man was finally sort-of doing what was expected of him, but he couldn’t have a loose cannon like Gendro following him around right now. He was already late.

“No, thank you, Gendro, but it would be to much. I need to pursue this on my own for now. I will let you in as soon as I can,” Okin said. 

Gendro gave a soft smile and a nod, but Okin could tell it was fake.

“Take care of yourself Okin,” Gendro said. “And get enough sleep next time.

Okin gave his own fake little smile back before leaving the room.
