Hanaata turned, yanking back her hand. The wooden double doors hit the rocky walls with a *slam,* swinging back and forth after the newcomers had entered the room.

Allia, strode forward with Taedon close behind. She gestured to Hanaata.

“Don’t wipe them. They have been accepted into our ranks. Release them immediately,” Allia said.

Hanaata’s wide eyes looked to Taedon, who nodded.

“Alright,” her smile returned. “I am sorry for the inconvenience and confusion I may have caused,” the woman bowed her head to the inmates. Billy pulled his head back from the bars, eyes wide.

Allia shot a glare at Hanaata, who scrambled forward, taking out a set of keys and unlocking the cell door.

Billy’s jaw dropped. He finally stood up after Damian and Benjamin were grouped with the rest of the strange Monastery-people on the other side, looking back to him with confusion.

Allia’s face was still a tinge red, the lines where her tears had dried still visible. What had the girl done? Was this part of some strange mind games that he couldn’t even comprehend?

He staggered out of the iron gate.

“So... what happened?” He asked the group.

“I realized the potential you three had, and how it was a wasted opportunity to let you go when you could develop your Heraldries and serve the Forces in your fullest capacity,” Allia folded her arms, curling and looking to the floor as her master spoke. Billy frowned. What had gone on between them?

“I apologize for such a... unorthodox entry,” Taedon continued. “Welcome to the Order of Tsuman. You will all be provided room and board, as well as a guide that will show you around and help you get settled.

The twin doors swung open again, and a tall, pale-skinned man waved to the group, smiling. Why were all these people so strange?

The newcomer strut over to the group, and Taedon motioned to him, continuing.

“This is Jerel, he will show you all to your rooms. Like you,” Taedon gestured to Billy, “he is Control Herald. You may end up training amongst each other.”

Jerel’s smile widened, and he did a small bow, almost curtsy-like. Billy cringed, and strangely, it seemed Allia did as well, although hers seemed more disheartened, as she visibly turned away from the rest of the group.

*Seriously, what is up with these people?*

“Ah, I am so glad we have new recruits. And a fellow Control Herald as well! That is really special,” Jerel said, smiling, reaching a hand out to Billy.

Billy looked him in the eyes, squinting. The man still held out his hand, with a face that made it look like he would get all the money in the world if he just shook Billy’s hand. It took him about ten awkward, draining seconds to get the hint.

“Ah, alright then. Mr. Control Herald isn’t a fan of handshakes,” Jerel said.

“Don’t call me that,” Billy said, arms crossed.

“Ah, well then, it’s the perfect opportunity for us to get to know each other. What might be your name, sir?” 

“Billy.”

“Ah! Apathasawian! Should’ve known by those stylish boots. I am *really* fascinated by Apathasawian culture and technology,” Jerel cocked his head like a parrot. “Although, come to think of it, you don’t really *sound* like an Apathasawian, sir.”

“He born in Wreathward. Town we just come from, I think.” Benjamin interrupted.

Billy shot a glare at Benjamin. He had never told his friend that, and what right did Benjamin have telling these weirdos strangers about Billy’s life?

“Oh!” Jerel said, sidestepping Billy and bringing his full attention to Benjamin. “Now you, you must be a full native Apathasawian. What Heraldry, though? Let me guess...Teleportation.”

“Close. Transportation,” Benjamin said.

“Aw,” Jerel shook his head, although his grin quickly returned. “My second guess. Some of my best friends are Transportation Heralds, and apparently the Transportation masters are some of the most fun. And a *lot* a cool stuff you can do on a flying island that you can’t do anywhere else.”

The man proffered his hand, and it disappeared into Benjamin’s massive one. 

“Uh, Benjamin.”

“Nice to meet you, Benjamin. Such unique names, from Apathasaw,” Jerel said. The lofty man stepped over to Damian, offering the shiny smile and spindly hand again.

“Don’t touch my brother, cinker,” Billy said.

Jerel turned, his green eyes lit up. 

“Oh! That is a unique Apathasawian word, yes?”

“Yes,” Benjamin said. “How I explain? It like mongrel, but worse.”

Taedon let out a grunt. “Well, maybe I will see you all soon. Allia,” the girl finally peeked up from the floor. “Come along.”

Taedon marched out of the room, Allia slinking behind. Jerel watched with a bright smile as she left.

“Ah, where were we? Oh yes. What is your name, sir?” Jerel looked to Damian with wide eyes.

“Damian.”

“Ah, and what Heraldry might you possess?”

“I---I believe I’m a Mind Herald,” Damian said, his black bangs swinging down over his face.

“Wow. We’ve got a real interesting set here,” Jerel said, clasping his hands. “Well. It is my honour to welcome you all to the Monastery. C’mon. Let”


The girl’s shoulders were slumped. A part of Billy almost felt bad for her.

But still, this could be part of her game.
