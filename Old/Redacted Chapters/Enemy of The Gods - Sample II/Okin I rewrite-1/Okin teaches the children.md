Okin looped back around the bridge, whistling on his way as he admired the flocks of teapot-like birds that flapped around the fountain. In the square, also, two boys were sitting around an array of small painted rocks and sticks laid out against the stone pathway. Four other boys, all around seven or eight, surrounded the two, their arms huddled around their legs.

“You can’t do that though!” the first boy, who had short blonde hair, shouted. “That’s not how a real city would work! It’s just dumb!”

“I know it’s not how a *real* city would work, but it’s not fun the way *you* play!” a boy with wavy dark hair replied. 

“It is! Look, everyone else thinks it’s fun, right?” the blonde boy looked to his friends, who just rocked on their bottoms with their heads tucked into their knees, n0t saying a word. 

“See, everyone thinks it’s boring! I bet---“

“Good morning boys!” The boys turned and looked up to see High Ather Okin walking over to them.

The boys looked up at the robed man. 

“Hello, Ather,” they said in unison.

“I could hear that you’re all having a disagreement that is interrupting your game. Well, if you don’t mind, might I tell you a story that may help you solve the problem? It is one of my favorites.”

The boys glanced at each other, and then all nodded slowly.

“Alright,” Okin smiled. “You all remember the Age of Darkness and what happened from mass, yes?”

The group nodded.

“Good. Then you all remember the Treachery of Deionis and Tregale that led up to the Betrayal, I assume. Now, when Tregale first betrayed the Gods, they did not all know of his deception. At first, only two of the Gods were aware of Tregale’s betrayal: Intillia, and of course, the all-knowing Olitheon.\[ comma, 2021-05-21 10:57 AM

The story in this is way too telly and boring: maybe add beats? Maybe eliminate entirely?\] When Olitheon discovered the grave news, he first sought out his most trusted ally--- his brother, Nexon. He flew around the world until he found his brother and delivered him the message of the Betrayal.

“Now Nexon, of course, was devastated, but he trusted his brother with all his heart, and obeyed when Olitheon told him to run across the world and find all the Gods that hadn’t had their minds corrupted by Tregale. The two of them worked together to gather up all the other Gods and brought them to the highest peak in the world.”

The children glanced at each other with agape mouths, seeing if anyone knew which mountain was the highest in all of Opartha. Okin motioned for them to simmer down, and they refocused their attention.

“The other Gods were afraid, angry and confused, but they listened anyway because they respected the brothers. But Nexon and Olitheon didn’t have time to prepare a speech, and so they both started speaking to the Gods. Nexon, of course, appealed to the Joy and beauty of the world, while his brother spoke of the irrationality of Tregale’s destruction. At first, they stumbled, and their points distracted from each others’, which only stressed the other Gods.

“But they eventually realized that they, of course, had the same goal. Nexon allowed his brother to speak first, and backed up his brother’s logical points with heart. Soon, they were speaking together as one. United, the brothers reminded the Gods of all that they stood for, and they all had to lose should they not stand and fight against the dark lord Tregale with all their might. The brothers themselves were still very different by the end of it--- but they created a stronger united force out of that difference.”

“Now it seems,” Okin crouched down and motioned to the pebbles and sticks. “That you all have a united goal in having fun. Isn’t that right?”

The boys looked at each other and nodded.

“Maybe we can play the way you want,” the wavy-haired child said to the blonde boy.

“Or what if I and everyone else who wants to keep the city and soldiers organized plays as the city--- and you and everyone who wants to play more wild can play as bandits who try to cause chaos?” the blonde boy asked his friend.

The wavy-haired boy looked to the others, and they all smile and nodded.

“Alright, red rocks are the bandits, and black rocks are the soldiers, and the rest are the villagers!” the blonde boy shouted.

Okin stood up and stepped back, a smile on his face as he watched the boys shuffle around the rocks while shouting with ‘deepened’ voices, pretending to be commanders and raiders and the like.

He continued on his path and left the boys to their fun, but turned back around when he felt a light tug on his robe. It was one of the kids--- a boy no higher than Okin’s waist who looked quite a bit younger than the others.

“What happened after that, Ather Okin? After Olitheon and Nexon gave their speech?”

Okin bit his lip, though of course he knew he would tell the boy the Truth. 

“Well... Tregale arrived at the peaks and used the cursed magic of Darkness to corrupt the good minds of the Gods. B-but--- Olitheon and Nexon stood together, and fought valiantly to protect their friends, though they were vastly outnumbered. The Gods that escaped the deadly Wrath of Tregale reuninted with Aredal and Intillia, and of course, as you know, vanquished Tregale.”

The little boy scratched his head. “But--- what about after *that?* Like--- my dad said the Gods could live forever, so why aren’t there any *now*?”

Okin smiled and knelt down to get to eye level with the boy.

“Now, this may be a little difficult to understand, but you remember how each of the Four are the embodiment of the good Forces which created everything?”

The boy’s eyes lit up, and his head bobbed, urging Okin to continue. 

“Well, Tregale is the embodiment of the one Force of evil. The Force of Darkness. And though the Gods defeated Tregale himself, the Force of Darkness still lived on and threatened our world. So the Gods that were left--- the pure, *true* Gods that we worship today--- Sacrificed themselves to rejoin with the Forces so Tregale and the Force of Darkness could never wreck havoc on the world as they once did.”

The little boy took in a deep breath. Okin’s jaw hung in the air--- maybe it was too much to understand for one day.

Finally, the boy nodded.

“Thank you, Ather Okin.”

Okin’s grimace turned into a smile. “Thank *you* for your interest. Have a good time with your friends now.”

The little boy waved a scrawny arm before running back off to join the game.
