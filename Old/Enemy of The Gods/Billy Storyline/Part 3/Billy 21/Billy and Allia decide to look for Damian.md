Billy’s lungs and heart battered awake.

His torso and neck lurched up, and he clasped his chest, which was icky and wet.

“Forces!” Billy’s shoulders jumped again at Allia’s voice.

He clutched his own sides and his eyes shivered with the rest of his body. He cught nothing but a dark blur that was the wilderness behind the glow of Allia’s hands.

“A---Allia. W-where’s---“

“Damian and Benjamin? I have no idea,” her head hung low and the Light from within faded. “You’re awake though. T-that’s good.”

Was that a feint hint of a smile? He hadn’t seen anything but a glare from her since that festival at the Monastery. Maybe she was trying to express her gratitude for saving her life, and was just doing an awkward job of it. To be fair, he hadn’t really expressed his that well when she’d saved him either.

His mind shuffled back to his brother and his best friend, and he stood up. He half expected for his vision to fade in and find them waving to him from a lush hill down below. But there was nothing but dense, dark stumps as thick as three men shoulder-to-shoulder and wet green tentacles reaching down from the bushy canopy dozens of meters above to touch the variety of ferns below.

“No...we’re not... no!” Billy slammed his fist against the ground, hitting a thick root sticking out from the dirt. 

“What is it?” Allia leant over with wide eyes.

“*What is it*?” Billy shouted back at her. Her mouth trembled and she retreated slightly. “*It* is that both my best friend and my brother have probably drowned in the *Leviathi Strait*! And we’re--- we’ve got to be in cinking *Krinosas!*”

Allia shrivelled up in a ball and lost eye contact with Billy.

“Oh. Y-yeah, of course,” she said. “Well--- I know it seems unlikely--- but you don’t *know* that they’re dead.”

“Yes, I do,” Billy squeezed his temples with one hand. “It’s an absolute *miracle* that *we* made it. I---“

“Well, it wasn’t really a *miracle*,” Allia gave a guilty, slight smile. “Very lucky, but it is explainable.”

Billy raised an eyebrow and scowled. 

“Well, after you went unconscious, the ship began to fall apart. The hit from the monster destroyed most of the wood of the ship and the the seas eroded much of the rest that was barely holding together. You were unconscious, so I had to hold your arm the whole way.  slid all the way to the back of the ship, but the rails 

“So you saved me yet again,” Billy crossed his arms.

“Uhm---  I guess so? B-but I wouldn’t have been able to do so if you hadn’t done so first,” Allia gave a feint smile. “I guess now’s a good time tp thank you for that.”

“Yeah, and you’ve saved me like what? Three times now? And plus, I was about *this* close to letting you fall to your death,” Billy extended his index finger and thumb so they were less than an inch between each other. 

“It’s not---,” Allia closed her eyes and clenched her fist. Light shot through her veins, and instinctively Billy shrunk back defensively. 

“It’s not a competition, Billy,” Allia relaxed and the light faded. “And you *did* decide to help me. The way I see it, we worked as a team.”

“Yes. It’s all just a bunch of happy-dappy brightness to you. How do you---,” Billy stood to his feet.

“How do you just follow this weird little *code,* goin’ around, devoting your life to sticking your nose in other people’s shit and “helping” them?” He shouted. He threw his hands at her while he talked and paced around the trees.

“How do you do this little *distant dance* with everyone you know? Look! You don’t actually *care* that my brother and my friend are almost definitely--- dead!” His eyes teared up at the thought. 

“You’re all about *giving your life away* but there’s no *real* connection there. No, you’re just all smiles and optimistic little expressions and---“

Billy let out a throaty scream. He dug his boot into the ground and clutched his face as red tears formed in his eyes. 

He glanced to Allia. Her eyes were empty and glued to the ground. Tiny, clear tears fell from them.

“I---,” Billy relaxed himself and wiped away the tears. “That was too much. It’s not---“

“No, maybe you’re right,” Allia’s face was still distant in contemplation. “Maybe my whole life has just been following this code because those above me tell me to. I--- I feel robbed, but after what happened, I really don’t know. Maybe it is just a bunch of--- you know---“

Billy clenched his jaw. What she was saying... he’d finally got one of these sheep to *admit* to the possibility of their lives being a meaningless adherence to an inherently corrupt system. But... she didn’t *mean* to take advantage of Billy and Damian. Maybe... maybe she was one of the *victims* of the corrupt, manipulative authorities. 

Billy nodded solemnly. “Well, to be honest, I do think it is all just a bunch of bullshit. But--- you *did* stand against the Monastery for our sakes. You could have just let me die on that ship, and you could have let all of us get killed at the Monastery. It’s just kind of cinking dumb to say that you *only* care about us because of your... religion,” Billy said.

Allia looked up and a slight smile formed on her face. She gave a slight nod as she wiped away the tears.

“Well, there’s certainly no time for sitting around,” Billy reached out a hand to Allia, who was still sitting on a bed of plants. “C’mon, let’s get up and go.”

Allia took Billy’s arm, and Billy helped pull her to her feet. She marched past him and pulled aside a wall of vines. With a confident, sassy smile, she motioned for him to join her.

He ran up and followed her through the faux flora door. 

“There were maps on the walls of the room,” he said as they stepped over the darkened roots of a colossal tree.

“Yeah, exactly,” Allia raised an eyebrow. “I---I looked at a few of them,” she pulled out a wrinkled piece of parchment from the inside of her tunic\[ 2022-01-05, 9:19 PM

Check to see if this is really whaat she was wearing\]. “And this one here--- it *is* a rough map of Krinosas. The cellar--- did you---“

“I found it on the second night, wandering around,” Billy bit his lip. There was obviously something wrong with Kiatus, but from their conversation in the vault of the ship it did appear he had a good heart. Billy was still unsure if Kiatus did everything he could to save them by fighting the leviathan or if he was the one who got them killed.

“Well,” Billy forced himself to smile. There was still some hope, they weren’t completely in the dark. “We can use the map 

“We have to *try!* If there’s even a chance we’ll find them, we have to try!” Billy glared at Allia.

His eyes fell to the map she was holding. 

*Ah, her main concern is this quest to find whatever those Monastery whackos were looking for. She may genuinely care about us for whatever reason--- but that doesn’t mean she’s done with all her crazy beliefs.*

Her hands still flashed erratically with Light, despite the fact that there she didn’t appear to be using her powers.

*And unfortunately, I need her help.*

“Allia--- it’s not your responsibility to help me--- but I fear that the only real chance of finding them will be if you create a beacon with your Light Heraldry,” Billy looked to Allia. Her cheeks drew back and her lips shrivelled. She glanced back down at the map.

“And--- I’ll help you find whatever artifact you’re looking for afterward,” Billy feigned a smile.

Allia looked up from the map. Billy widened his smile and reached out a hand. It was a necessary sacrifice if it meant getting Damian back. And he didn’t specify *to what extent* he’d help her look for it.

“Alright,” Allia took his hand and shook. “We’ll go out to the coast, and look for any hints of where they could’ve landed, and I’ll shine the beam for a few days,” Allia took her hand back. She looked away from Billy and scratched her elbow.

“But--- but if we don’t---“

*I’ll jump into the Strait and drown myself.*

“We’ll find them,” Billy interrupted. “As I said, we have to.”
