Billy stepped back from the door, and squeezed the side of his temples. His knuckles were red.

He heard several footsteps. He whipped around. Damian had pushed past the gate. The boy’s eyes were wide with concern.

And those eyes hadn’t changed one bit.

But there was another pair of footsteps, coming from the right side of the large garden. Billy reached for his gun.

A stout man with a small nest of grey hair peaked out from the far right wall of the house. With a hunch, he strut forward to the centre of the path and glanced back and forth between frozen Damian and Billy.

Billy’s fingers stopped and shook. The stout man, likely a good thirty years older than Billy, gave him an open-mouthed stare of confusion. Billy’s eyes widened as he got a better look at the man’s wide face.

“Hello?” The grey-haired man said. “I heard knocking on the door. What are you two doing here?” 

“I--- I---,” Damian stuttered.

“We’re here to see the owner of this household. We heard it was a Mr. Lionos Gruissem,” Billy said with confidence. 

Both Damian and the stout man looked up at Billy with shock. 

“Uhm--- I---  Lionos’s been--- Lionos’s been reunited with the Gods for *ten years*.  To the day, in fact,” the stout man said.

Damian gave Billy a face of panicked protest, but Billy continued addressing the elder man. 

“I--- I apologize, my accomplice and I are traders from Apathasaw, and we were sent on a mission to make a deal with the owner of Gruissem Shipment and Co. Our records stated the founder and chairman was a Mr. Lionos Gruissem.”

The elder man shook his head and scratched the little tuft of hair on the very top of his scalp. 

“I’m afraid your information is severely outdated,” he said. “As I said, Lionos---  ascended a decade ago, to the tee.”

“Well,” Billy sighed and stomped his boot on the deck. “Could we possibly speak to the--- *heirs* of his estate?”

“Mr. Lettinhaux and Mr. Gorbot inherited most of Mr. Gruissem’s company. I am sorry to say that I do not have a clue of where they might be,” the elder man replied. 

Billy jabbed a thumb toward the mansion, “And--- ” 

“*I* watch over Lionos’s former property,” the stout man interjected.

Billy went down a couple steps so he was more level with the man. 

“So *you’re* the inheritor of this property?” He asked.

“Well, not *exactly*. But, it is uncontested, and both I and the town believed that we should maintain it in Lionos’s name. I volunteered for the position,” the man replied. 

Billy had to hold back from scowling at the response. Instead, he plastered on the over-the-top smile of an Apathasawian salesman.

“This? This lovely property is... *uncontested*? That is rather--- shocking,” he said.

“Lionos was a very well-respected man,” the elder man replied. “In fact, it is quite a coincidence you are here, as I will be attending the Decadem ceremony of his funeral tomorrow.”

“Well,” Billy shook his head. “That is--- unfortunate. I was hoping I would see him today. I guess our journey was all for naught then.”

Damian looked at Billy confusedly. Billy gave him a wink when the older man wasn’t looking, but that did little to assure the youth.

“Well, why don’t you come back to my house for a little while. I can try to brief you on everything I know about Lionos, and what little I know about his company,” the older man said.

This time, Damian really shook his head, but Billy only saw it after he had responded.

“That sounds excellent.”

Damian threw his hands up in the air in question, and Billy and the older man exchanged smiles.

“It is back towards the centre of town. Come, let us go before it becomes Dark. Oh, and where are my manners. I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Mr. Cantas\[ 2021-11-04, 2:15 PM

Change if name changes\].”

Billy gave a smile, but his eyes were empty. He already knew the man, and he already knew the name.
