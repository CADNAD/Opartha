The crowd had formed. This was the largest one yet, larger than Arten’s speech, larger than the execution of that yourg Dark Herald, larger than the execution of Breslo. There was an unusual amount of clergy within the audience, as many who would vote had come from Whenran to The Citadel, as was tradition.

Okin’s heavy metal shell stood in between him and the world, even shielding his face from The Citadel, but he was vulnerable. 

As were the candidates, who stood atop a podium each, all stationed on an upraised wooden stage.  

Two insignificants, hardly a rounding error, with little support or backing.  

Okin’s horse stood proud; Trenton had the recurring advantage, and as usual, a heartfelt smile across his face. Calm, calculated, yet confident. His poise was contagious, especially to Okin, who relaxed his scrunched shoulders.

Okin’s old friend shrunk himself; Previa lifted his hand to wave to the crowd, but his body and smile wavered.  Yet his presence made the Ather’s skin prick underneath the silver armour. It had been some time since they spoke, and Okin still had to remind himself that the boy was in a race, running for the position of *Impalias.*

And yet, Previa was a valiant lion compared to the last of the candidates, who slumped over to his podium. But Arten made Okin’s stomach wrench, and crumpled his heart.

He wasn’t supposed to be there. 

He had promised---in fear, but he had. Perhaps Okin shouldn’t have taken the words of a man fearing for his life in the alleys of darkness, but he had. Whatever that strange being with the beak-shaped mask was, it must’ve gotten to Arten somehow. He knew it was likely the case, but he had hoped otherwise. And now, it seemed there was nothing left to do.

Okin pushed forward, standing tall, checking to see if it really was him. There was no doubt.

“Attention!” 

The rumbling crowd froze. Where all five candidate’s eyes met, in the centre of the five podiums, stood another; Red pellegrina and cape around strong shoulders, the hallmark of an Impalias of Intillia. 

“Thank you all for attending. As tradition, before the Rothars, Devinars, Athers and High Athers of the Central Whenranish region vote on who will become their next Impalias, the candidates will have an opportunity to showcase themselves and their Dedication to the world,” the red-dressed Impalias shouted. 

*Impalias Merinin should be pretty unbiased, considering he’s in between Previa and Trenton’s age, and not a Dedicant of Aredal or Olitheon. At least it’s not Aldwin.*

“Let us begin,” Merinin said, taking a seat on a chair in the centre of the stage. 

The first couple questions were for the two irrelevant candidates, both High Athers. They answered finely, but no one in the crowd really paid much attention.

Merinin scooted in closer to the table, eyeing the farthest candidate on the left.

“Previa.”

Okin’s good friend scooted closer to his podium.

“You are exceptionally young to be running for such an esteemed position, and many say far too inexperienced, especially considering you are not even a High Ather yet. What do you say to those who claim you don’t have enough experience to be an Impalias?” Merinin asked.

Previa’s teeth glistened in an assuring smile.

“Since I was born, I have been learning of Versalism. I was raised in the once small town of Metheno, raised by an Impalias, raised by The Citadel itself. My best friends had known their whole lives that they would become Athers, as I did, as I did,” the young Ather reached his arms out the audience, gesticulating passionately. \[ 2021-03-14, 5:08 PM

“I wish to be a pillar that is rooted in those who support me, and carries that energy to those who I must support. I wish to be a novel voice, but one that is only novel because it has been infused with the *Knowledge*, the *Wisdom*, the *Gratitude*, the *Humility,* the *Discipline,* the *Compassion,* the *Bravery,* and the *Truth* of all those who have come before me. I wish to serve my God, Aredal, in the greatest capacity, but to also ensure that all of us, The Citadel, a united Wreathward, a united *Versalism---* can do the will of The Four, to show our united, eternal Dedication.”

The crowd held silent, taking in the speech of the young candidate.

Then, they broke into thunderous applause.

It clambered, echoing within the walls of Okin’s armour. The crowd grew larger, grew upwards, and Okin was consumed by the cheers and shouts.

*That was not--- there is no way, that was not Previa.*

The Ather ducked his head, fruitlessly trying to hide his giant metallic form in shame.

Finally, through the stifling of Impalias Merinin, the crowd finally settled down, readying to ask another question.

Arten, one podium to the right of Previa, raised his hand. 

“Yes?” Merinin said, gesturing to Arten.

“If I may, I do believe my fellow candidate is doing quite well in his own Dedication by running for Impalias. It is quite Brave, especially at such a young age. H-He is a very strong new voice.”

The moderator---along with the rest of the crowd---leaned in for the counterpoint, but Arten just smiled.

“Well, thank you, High Ather Arten,” Merinin said. “As one of the four candidates here that is not running for re-election, what will you bring to the table if chosen as one of the ten Impaliases?

Arten smiled, briefly glancing down the top of his podium before straightening his back.

“In such a rapidly changing world, of course, I always search for more, to learn all that we can from all that we discover. That is the meaning of Exploration. But we also must make sure to remember our past, our tradition, what brought us here. That is Wisdom,” Aretn reached an upturned palm out to Previa. “It is like my fellow candidate said, we must be novel, but we can only be novel if we know what has been done before us, and what has worked.”

Okin marched closer to the stage, his heavy armour clearing the way through the crowd for him. Arten turned his arm to Merinin. “Like you, and all the Dedicants of Intillia, I believe in Peace. We must unite The Citadel and work together. In this ever-changing world, we must be stable, we must be grounded in our beliefs, our faith--- our Dedication.”

Arten raised his hand to the crowd, and there was some brief clapping. Okin had finally made it to the front of the mass, just next to Merinin and the stage.

“Thank you, High Ather Arten. And last but not least, running for re-election, Impalias Trenton. Please tell us how you will continue to serve The Citadel if elected.”

It was distorted through Okin’s narrow slit, as much of the ceremony had been, but he was finally close enough to make out their faces.  And Trenton’s was blood red, sweating profusely.

Several seconds went by, and Okin’s heart beat faster, almost matching the blood flowing to Trenton’s head.

“Impalias Trenton?” Merinin asked.

“H-he--- that---that was my speech!” Trenton shouted, pointing at Arten. “He, he spoke my speech!”

“What are you talking about?” Merinin asked. “He spoke his speech, now you speak yours.”

“No, no, no, no, you don’t understand,” Trenton spit, fumbling around with some paper at the top of his podium. “His speech, I planned it, I wrote it out, and somehow he said it, word for word.”

Trenton’s body shook, and he pointed a wavering finger at Arten, who just gave a neutral smile.

“That’s not possible, and even if it is, it doesn’t matter,” Merinin said. “Just answer the question.”

Trenton’s eyes widened, and he staggered forward, wiping off the beads of sweat from his forehead. 

“I-I--- will continue to serve The Citadel as I have, since I was elected. It is crucial that we, that we---“ 

Trenton’s hands trembled more violently, and he stabilized his body against the podium.

“That we elect leaders with experience. I-I---,”

Trenton wheezed, resting both arms against the stand, and buried his face in them.

“Impalias Trenton?” Merinin asked. “Are you okay? Can you continue?”

Trenton raised one arm, and peeked up slightly.

“I-I---just go on.”

The rest of the debate was more contained, but the damage had already been done, and it continued to snowball. 

*There was never an inkling in my mind that Previa would have a chance at becoming an Impalias, but I did not account for corruption. Arten---he has successfully blurred himself with Trenton, making a wise, brilliant man look a fool, and vice-versa.* 

Had Okin really stopped Arten from running, the election would be a landslide in Trenton’s favour. But now--- what was there to do?

The debate ended, and the candidates made their way down the stage. A horde of guards dressed identical to Okin stood in their way, blocking them off from the rest of the crowd.

Okin made his way around the stage to the right edge of the crowd, and Previa stepped down from his podium, stuffing some sheets into his pocket.

*Previa.*

Okin turned around, facing the crowd he was once apart of.

“Back it up, back it up,” he said, gently guiding the people away from the stage with his outstretched armoured arms.

Now there was just empty street between him and a wandering Previa.

Okin snuck past the other Rothars, then marched in a straight line towards his old friend.

“Previa!”

The boy’s neck snapped around like a bird, and Okin stomped to a stop right in front of him, tilting up his visor. Previa blinked rapidly, craning his neck in closer.

“*Okin?*”

Okin raised a finger to his lips.

“Quiet. Is anyone coming to get you?” 

“Uhm...I think there should be,” Previa’s eyes darted around. 

Okin checked his shoulders, then grabbed him by the arm.

“Well then, we don’t have much time,” the High Ather said.

“What is going on, Okin?” Previa asked. “I haven’t seen you for weeks! And father is still looking for you. Father says---“

Okin tightened his metal grip on the young Ather’s arm and pulled him closer with another hand on the shoulder. He stared down into his friend’s pale green eyes.

“Previa. You have to drop out of the race.”

Previa jumped back, loosing himself from Okin’s grip. The boy stumbled, holding his arms out between him and Okin to gain balance. 

“Why? Why would I do such a thing?” He shouted.

Okin checked his surroundings. There were Rothars in groups, chatting amongst each other, masses of people dispersing in different directions, offsprings from the giant crowd that had come to watch the debate, and carriages with their passenger’s faces and clothing shielded by horses or rooftops.

“T-there isn’t enough time to explain,” Okin said. “But you must, it is for the good of The Citadel and all of Versalism. If you want an explanation, we must meet. In front of your house, tonight. Before the ballots begin.”

“That---,” Previa lowered his hands and stood up straighter. “That won’t work. Father is looking for you. He will have armies of Rothars guarding our estate, all searching to capture you. If you want \[ 2021-03-18, 10:32 AM

Maybe take out this line\]to meet, it’ll have to be somewhere else,” the boy’s eyes locked with Okin’s faceless mask. 

The heat and bulk of the armour charged Okin again, and his heart spilled blood and sweat.

“There,” Previa inched closer to Okin, motioning with his chin over the High Ather’s shoulder. “That Devinar, he’s part of my father’s personal guard. He’s coming towards us.”

Okin didn’t even look, he just grabbed Previa again and pulled him close. 

“Okay. I am staying as a Rothar at the garrison on the corner of Vaskiel and Revictus. I’ll meet you in the front tonight at the ninth hour. Be there.”

Previa nodded like a fearful child, and Okin released his grip. Then he marched off into the street, leaving his final, desperate shot there to confront the Devinar.
