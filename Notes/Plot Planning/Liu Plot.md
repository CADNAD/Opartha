## Event List

Liu takes the civil service exam. *(intro to Liu as a character and how he thinks)*

Liu is at home with his parents. *(Emphasize the way his family views the Empire and how his parents view differ)* They discuss possible career paths if Liu does not pass the exam. Results were given to the other test takers from his village days ago. An Imperial magistrate arrives to tell Liu that he has been summoned to the capital. He must leave immediately. 

Liu arrives in the provincial capital. He sees posters for the up coming election and see some buildings converted to a more Imperial style of architecture. He is interviewed by Shi when he arrives in the capital. Shi accuses Liu of cheating and asks how he solves certain problems. Shi is impressed and asks Liu if he ever considered military service. Shi speaks a lot about Delmia as a concept hinting at his true allegiance to a free Delmian state. Liu says he just wants to do work and do well by his family. Shi convinces him *(not sure how yet)* and he is sent to the Imperial Military college in the South.

The Delmian representative is murdered and riots begin to erupt.

A popular Delmian representative recently advocated for integration and pushed it through the Song Roung. Many people trust the presentative and he is a figure head and seems poised to become one of the Triarchs. Most Delmians see themselves as Delmians first and foremost. But Eastern Delmians see themselves as Imperial citizens or have a more mixed identity. A minority of the clans of the recognize Imperial rule. Elections for an Imperial Delmian representative are underway.
