Okin marched down the streets, heading for Aldwin’s manor. But his stride was stop by a large obstacle blocking the main road and the central marketplace; hundreds of people were gathered around, encircling a small procession.

He had to get through, but the crowd poured across the entire street. As he tried to get through, he saw all their gazes and feet moving towards something in the centre.

His curiosity spiked, he stood on his tiptoes in an attempt to get a view over the large crowd. A glare crossed his vision from the shining armour of a Rothar, until it was crushed by the shadow of a large wooden pole which towered over the crowd. Okin could not see very well and his view was often covered by taller men, so he moved through the large group until he was face-to-face with the centrepiece scene. 

There were four Rothars. They guarded a lone, dirtied man with  a black bag over his head and hands held around his back. At the front of the crowd stood another, leading the procession--- a High Ather, same as Okin. 

The Ather stepped forward toward the mass of the gathering, and held out his palm as to bless the people with his Dedication. They received blessings of Truth and Justice, as depicted by the upward golden triangle and the down and leftward golden triangle.

One of the Rothars pinned the man to the tall wooden stake as the other two quickly tied a rope behind his back. Strangely, a final Rothar stood on the wooden platform, holding a small steel case lantern, even though the sun shone brightly overhead. The leading Ather raised his hand to silence the chattering crowd. 

“You have all gathered today--- to witness an act of holy Justice. The Darkness of Tregale has flown through the veins of this man, and it must be *removed* from our world lest we hope to spell its doom,” the Ather shouted to the crowd. 

The Rothar’s tightened the rope around the man’s wrists and legs. The lead Ather continued speaking, unbothered as the dirtied man kicked and struggled, his screams muffled by the suppressor.

“Aredal, Intillia, Olitheon, and Nexon, they fought to rid our world of the evil of Tregale, who sought to dominate humanity or leave it in ashes, who Betrayed them despite their endless compassion and kindness. He corrupted even other *Gods* and now seeks to corrupt the men of our age! But we will not have it! We must show Tregale that we will not bend to his will of Darkness, that we will stand strong through our Dedication!”

As he shouted the final word, the Rothars stepped aside, except one, who stood in front of the stake, removing the candle from inside its steel shell.  He held out the candle towards the quivering prisoner. The Rothar raised his other hand behind the candle, and a tiny fire flickered in the wind.

With a simple flick of the finger, the man was dowsed in flames.
