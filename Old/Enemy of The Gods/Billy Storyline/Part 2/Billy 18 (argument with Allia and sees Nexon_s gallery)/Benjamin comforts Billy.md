Billy stormed into the cabin. He tried to slam the door, but it just swung back and forth. 

He sat down on one of the beds. He grinded his temples and rocked back and forth to exaggerate that infuriating sway of the ship. He screamed with clenched teeth, manifesting a demonic throaty howl. The hinges of the door continued to squeal; that back-and-forth shrill had been yet another obstacle between him and sleep, and it wasn’t helping his rising rage. 

He stood up and clenched a fist. He took four determined steps to the door, ready to destroy the already piece of shit wood with his boot.

The squeal stopped before he got there. Billy jumped back and raised his fist in primal fear. 

The door fully pushed inside until it hit the wall of the room. A black, meaty hand rested against the edge of the door.

“Billy,” Benjamin entered the room. “You alright?”

“I’m---,” Billy stopped. He clawed upwards at his sideburns again. 

Then he swung around and kicked the bed frame. Again, and again, and again. His foot probably hurt, but the pain was just fuel.

“Billy, enough!”

There was a sharp stab as his toenail cracked inside his boot, but he kept kicking.

“Billy!” 

Billy felt a violent *yank* underneath his feet. His knees were lifted up above the ground, away from the bed. With clenched teeth, he ramped up his kicking.

Billy thrusted his legs, and the levitating stopped as soon as it began. 

*Slam*! Billy’s back smashed against the floor. He let out a high-pitched shrill. 

“Billy! Billy!” Benjamin ran over and leant down. Billy was breathing heavily. 

“Sorry, Billy! Sorry!” Benjamin, shook his head. “Men very hard to control with with Heraldry. Just--- had to stop you--- destroying yourself, Billy.”

Billy sighed, and lifted his head up to slam it flat against the floor. 

“I know, I know, Benjy. I was... unreasonable, and I’m being neurotic. I went too far, I was *vile.* But I’m not even *trying* to be. There’s just so much anger when I see--- when I see---“

Benjamin let Billy’s head rest against his hand, and Billy turned to stare up at his old friend.

“I know, Billy. It’s okay. You just look out for him. I--- I will always make sure he is safe. Maybe best he and you stay on coast and I take Allia find artifacts.”

Billy stared up at the empty, wet wood roof. From the gaps in the planks, water dripped down just above his head.

“Maybe it’s not about him. Maybe it’s about me,” Billy muttered.

*“*Damian--- he’s right. He--- since he was a boy, I’m the only person he’s ever gotten to know. He spent his childhood playing with the few toys I could nab from people’s houses and reading the books I lifted from’em. Even in Metheno, Damian was quiet. He only talked to a few other kids. And when we left--- I was the only person he interacted with daily for *years*. And the fucking sick fuck that I am--- it makes me *angry* that he wants to get to know someone else. That he wants to leave my sick world.”

Billy’s chest heaved up and down. It was arduous to even keep all the emotions bottled up in his chest, to not break down. Benjamin’s presence helped--- he would never dare hurt his loving friend.

“He does want to do more now, Billy. But--- he will never forget all that you have done for him. He knows,” Benjamin pointed a thick finger at Billy’s chest. “Don’t blame yourself. He is always at centre of your world. And you will always be centre of his.”

Billy nodded. He felt his eyes watering up, so he bit his tongue gently.

“C’mon, get up Billy,” Benjamin laughed. The giant man took Billy’s hand and back and helped him off the floor.

“Thanks,” Billy smiled softly.

“No need. You and him---,” Benjamin pointed to his heart. “Also part of my centre.”

Billy nodded. A little embarrassment boiled inside him; he had been subjecting Benjamin,  one guy he *knew* who didn’t really have a negative shred in his body, to all this chaos between him and Allia.

Benjamin didn’t deserve that. Hell\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-25 2:09 PM

Probably get rid of this, find a replacement\], *she* probably didn’t deserve it. 

But--- as Benjy said, Damian was the centre of his world. And his point was right--- Allia didn’t have the right to take that away. And Benjy, being a reasonable person, did see that Krinosas was *way* too dangerous a place for someone as young and frail as Damian. In fact, Billy felt a little nervous about letting his best friend go alone with the girl.

“Billy,” Benjamin interrupted Billy’s train of thought. “Wanna come back outside?”

Billy paused.

“Nah,” Billy said. There had been enough anger and arguing already, and sure, he wanted to give Damian a little space for today. Benjy was already coming around, and Damian--- he’d likely relent the second he saw the coast of that terrifying continent.

“I’m think I’m just gonna lay down for a little while,” Billy smiled softly. “But--- tell them that I’m sorry for getting so heated.”

Benjamin nodded. Billy lay down on the bed and rolled over. Benjamin tried to close the door, but it just swung back and forth again, the hinges creating a that rhythm of squeals.
