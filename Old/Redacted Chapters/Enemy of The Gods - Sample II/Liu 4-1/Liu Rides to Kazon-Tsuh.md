The first day of their ride had been arduous. Liu’s thigh’s ached and he clung desperately to the unruly mare. Shi had done his best to help him, giving tips on how to settle the horse, and correct Liu’s posture multiple times.

“It’s all right Liu, I have confidence you’ll get the hang of this before long,” Shi said. With the sun setting, Shi had pulled his small group into a roadside rest stop, managed by a singular elder woman.

“I’m sorry, but I don’t get the point of riding a horse. Riding carriages just seems so much more efficient.” Around the two soldiers swarmed tying their own horses up to poles in the stable. 

Liu observed their knots and did his best to replicated them. He lopped his length of rope around a pole and brought it across itself. He lopped it over and back again the way the other soldiers had, and pulling tight, found it held quite nicely. 

Shi turned from his own knot and gave the teen a sigh. “Sure, a carriage has its uses. But on the battlefield every commander uses a horse. It’s more maneuverable and it’ll help instill your men with a sense of honour.” Shi put on a voice, shaking his over the last portion of his statement. 

The horse let out a *heeee* and Liu jumped back abruptly. Shi placed a hand on his shoulder and let out a nasally laugh. “You’ll get used to it Liu. I have faith you’ll learn fast.” 

It wasn’t until past noon on their second day of riding that Shi told Liu where they were going.  “Have you ever been to Kazon-Tsuh?” Shi asked

Liu shook his head. He had heard of the city before. Seat of Clan Hwara, the city was far in the north, nestled. In The Mara Valley.  It was a place where tradition blended with modernity. The centre of imperial power in Delmia, that was what his book had said. 

“I’ve seen photos before, but never been to the real thing.” 

Shi let out a long sigh--- which he had been doing quite often, “I think you’ll enjoy it. I think someone like you can see something in that city that I never could.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Even at the height of Delmian power, it was said to the most beautiful city in all the empire. But I never understood it,” Shi looked over his shoulder at Liu. “If I’m honest, most the cities look the same to me. I never got architecture.” 

It seemed there was much Shi *didn’t get,* and the inspector was fond of sharing---even when unprompted. Over their five day ride to Kazon-Tsuh, he spoke of how he was perplexed by poetry, music, sports, and dumplings. He seemed hyper-focused on the final point as he harped on about how he could never be sure what a dumpling was. 

“If I put a dumpling inside a dumpling, is that now a dumpling flavoured dumpling? What if both are empty and contain nothing but the other dumpling?”

Tangents like this were common, yet Liu didn’t mind them. They filled the otherwise complete silence of riding. 

Shi was pondering another dumpling conundrum when they arrived at the gates to Kazon-Tsuh. The city lay in the centre of the valley, a river sneaking under a grate in the wall. In front of Liu the wall bulged out to accommodated a gate house. A two tired pagoda of orange wood and dull red tiles worn down time made up the gate house. On either side of the gate house,  a cannon peeked over the edge.

As they approached the gates, the guard spotted the banners held high by Shi retinue of soldiers and quickly ushered them in. Under him, he could feel the horse’s gait smooth as they moved from cobbled roads around the city, to the smooth paved roads of the city’s interior. The streets were an orchestra of chaos. Cries of children and street hawkers surrounded Liu, their standards dwarfed by the multi stored buildings around them. Here in the southern section of the city the buildings were wooden with stone bases and aquamarine roofs, which rose sloped off like a pagoda. Further down the road he could see hints of the northern district. Dominated by tall stone rectangular stone structures, the commonwealth’s architecture blotted out the sky.
