<200b> Space Crystals at the bottom of war balloons that can drop big bombs from allied camp without needing to carry the bombs, bombs do not even need to be explosive, as well mass amounts of flammable liquid.

## Time

Time can be mixed with regular units, wouldn't provide utility or need to be its own unit. The benefits are mostly in 1v1 combat

## Elements

**Solids**

​	Build forts and camps

​	Dig trenches and other fortifications, or alter the battle field before a battle to create a perfect environment

**Liquid**

​	Reverse the currents in naval combat

​	Drain blood from opponents bleeding out

​	A unit specialised to spread oil during combat

**Gas**

​	Heralds with lanterns in small squads as flame throwers. They can control the flow of battle and are effective against clumped 	enemies

## Tactics

Raiding would be more common to disrupt the better supply lines afforded by Heraldry

Large castles are not common. Forts with more pointed edges like star forts more common
