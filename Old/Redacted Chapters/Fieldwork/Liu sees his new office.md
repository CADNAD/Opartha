The rays of the rising sun illuminated a dark bruise on Liu’s left cheek.  Standing up, he pulled the lead up gently so his horse would follow suit.  He watched the path, and soon enough he saw Shi An on his horse riding towards him.  Liu mounted his horse as soon as he saw Shi.  

Shi An’s gentle smile changed to a concerned look as he saw the dark lesion.  “What happened Liu?”

“I was assaulted by one of the soldiers.  I don’t understand why, I was telling them about how I support the Empire and how the Delmians are foolish for-”

Shi An placed his arm on Liu’s shoulder.  “I’ll find you somewhere else to stay tonight.” 

Liu’s gaze moved down and to the left, away from Shi’s eyes.   “Thank you, Mr. Shi," he said quietly.

“Get on your horse Liu.  It’s time to start the day.”  Liu followed Shi’s instructions, and the two men travelled along the dirt path.  After a few minutes, they arrived at the stone building Liu had seen yesterday.  It was well maintained, with several windows and a large Imperial banner above the main doorway. 

The two dismounted from their horses and hitched them to a nearby post.  Shi took out a steel key from a pocket in his tunic, and used it to unlock the main door.  The large, metal entryway swung open.

The main lobby was decorated with fifteen plants, and four paintings along the walls.  The paintings were mostly of up-close plants and wildlife, with a large painting in the center of the room of the Nihda mountains seen from the outskirts of Delmia.  

It was more pristine then any room Liu had ever been in, and his eyes examined the walls from corner to corner. But what was most fascinating about the room was a wooden tower that stood in the centre of the room, directly in between the opposite staircases leading upstairs. The tower was the height of an average man, and where the man’s face would be sat a wooden box with a white circle embedded into it, with two black sticks that pointed at different numbers on the circle. Liu had read about these devices before, the new pendulum clocks, but he had never seen one in person. He continued to stare at the clicking tower as he followed Shi up the righthand staircase.

*To have an exact metric of the time that has passed, how amazing.* 

On the top of the stairs was a long hallway that was supported by stone pillars from below.  The wooden floor was covered by a red carpet with golden embroidery in the corners.  Shi went down the hall, and then led Liu to a small doorway.  

“Here is your office.  You’ll be doing mostly paperwork and accounting here, and will report directly to me.”  Liu looked around the room.  There was a well furnished, dark feckwood desk, along with a matching chair.  The walls were lined with several bookshelves and paintings of the wilderness of Wreathward and Marthia.  There were two large wooden cabinets that were embedded into the wall, along with a small wardrobe. On the floor there was a circular maroon rug, adding to the homey feel of the room.

“This is the nicest place I have ever seen.  Although these bookshelves seem rather unorganized," Liu said, causing Shi to smile. 

“Make yourself at home, but unfortunately not now.  I have an appointment for a checkup at a farm near Tsura, and I want you to come along,” Shi replied. “There should be some clothes in the closet for you to change into, and then we’ll get going.”

Liu opened the wardrobe, and inside were two long white tunics with crimson embroidery and a dark trim.  Alongside were black silk pants that matched well with the rest of the outfit, and on the floor was a pair of shiny black dress shoes.  Liu did as instructed and changed into the tunic, pants and shoes.  He folded up his farm clothes and hung them in the tunic’s previous location.

Liu followed Shi back out of the room, down the stairs, and out of the Delmian Department of Works.  As Shi expected, a group of fifteen soldiers had arrived in front of the building, waiting on their horses.  Shi greeted the soldiers while he and Liu unhitched their horses.  The caravan headed north on the path, towards Tsura. 

The road was made of stone, and quite well paved.  Despite the fact that they were finished hundreds of years ago, it looked as if the roads were constructed only a few years prior.  Their skill in construction was one of the few things Liu respected about Delmians.  

For hours, the men rode along the Northern path towards the city of Tsura.  Along the road were plains, mostly converted into farmland.  Liu took note of the town of Jeonsu in the eastern distance, and of the Sokju mountains to the far east.
