* The virus

The alien probes spread the virus when they scanned all the living things around it

The longer your body fights the virus before forming anti-bodies determine how strong a Herald is

The first Heralds are hit by the virus, they have no anti-bodies passed from food or parents so they fight the virus for longer making them stronger heralds.

Humans first get the virus from animals and it is spread slowly that way

* The Gems

Gems are all isotopes of the same elements.

A gem is found in a geode surround by Anti-Gems

* Anti Gem

Anti gem material comes from the outer shell of the crystals
Very soft raw, needs to be alloyed into other materials to be of use
Anti-gem alloys can not be bonded to other materials, armour or weapons made of it must be forged entierly of the material

When anti-gem or its alloy are at a near touching distance from a Herald, and they try to activate their power, they are physically sick.

** Anti space
Create anti movement field which totally disrupts objects moving through it
Can not blink into field
Blocks things from being transported through portals where the field is between the two portals totally

** Anti Light
Energy from light rapidly drains away 

** Anti Time
Can't activate powers within the field
When something under the influence of Object heraldry enters the field, it removes the most recent instance of virtual time

** Anti Elements
Can't move elements through it
Will revert the whole transformation when any part touches the field

** Anti Dark
Is a virtual field of light
