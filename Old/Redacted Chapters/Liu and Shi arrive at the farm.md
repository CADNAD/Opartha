After traveling north for three hours, the caravan made a turn at a small dirt path right of the main road.  Shi signaled to the other riders, letting them know that this was their destination.  It was a small farm fifteen miles southeast of Tsura.

The men slowed down their horses and came to a stop in front of the front gate. Behind the gate spanned a farm not unlike that of Mr. Iago’s. Liu noted however that there appeared to be only 3 acres of rice paddy, as opposed to the 7 on Mr.Iago’s farm. 

Coming from the nearby house, a stout man came to greet the inspection squad. Four beads of sweat dripped down past his ear as Shi and Liu dismounted. 

“Inspector Shi! A day early!” A toothless smile formed on the man's face. More sweat, double the rate of before. But Liu couldn’t blame the man. The Delmian heat was inhumane in these months.  

Shi dusted himself off before replying, “Well, we were in the area, and I decided to get this out of the way.”  

A lie. Liu was shocked that Shi would lie to the man. It didn’t sit right with Liu. Opening his mouth to speak his eye caught Shi’s.

“Isn’t that right Liu?” The newly hired administrator stood frozen by his superior’s gaze. Unsure of why, Liu complied with a simple nod. 

“Yes, we were.”  

The man seemingly gulped before turning down the paved road. “Please, please, follow me then.” Stepping foot onto the stone path Liu noted the depth of the path, nearly 30 centimeters too deep. Shi made no comment about it. 

“As you can see, my farmhands are working around the clock to make up for last season's deficit.” Alerted by the farm owner’s voice, Liu looked from the path to the rice paddies. The three acres of land flanked either side of the path. On the left side four farmhands toiled, while a further six worked the opposing side. All seemed to be in order here. The crops looked to be in the final phase of their growth. 

“Where are your records for this season's output?” From behind his notebook Shi peered to the shorter man. “Take us to see them, won’t you?” 

Liu watched the silent exchange as Shi closed the walls in on the farm owner. Waddling away back towards the gate, the farmowner gestured for the group to follow. But before Liu could cross, the long arm of Shi crossed his body. 

The official’s voice was a whisper. “Do you notice anything wrong?” Liu nodded and noted the bylaws he had seen broken. Shi chuckled at his observations. Patting his new apprentice on the shoulder a smile formed. “While you may be correct, I urge you to look at the bigger picture of things.” 

Finally removing his arm, Shi followed after the farm owner. The man led the pair to the house from which he had originated from. Looking around, Liu glanced at three storehouses. Each of the same design, large enough for 150 bags total. But on the left most house, Liu noticed the light reflected more strongly. It appeared as if this particular storehouse had been freshly painted, yet the other two remained in dilapidated conditions. 

“Liu!” from in the doorway Shi called out to him. For a moment Liu blinked dumbfounded before squirelling to the doorway. 

“My apologies sir,” a small shake of Shi’s head was the only reply. Inside the house Liu noted stained lernwood floors. The light brown complimented the darker stone walls. All around this floor of the house windows with complex angular coverings let light through in rectangular beams.  

“Is this new flooring? I quite prefer this to that old feckwood. Much more tactful.” Shi glided across the floor as his head spun, examining every corner of the room.

On the right-hand side near where Liu stood, the short man had now cracked open a large ledger. The man poured over the pages of the dense, bound book until he arrived on the latest page. 

“Here you are inspector Shi, 98 bags. Up 12 from last season.” Placing two hands on his hips the man proudly presented the ledger. Liu and Shi both walked to examine it. By all accounts, it seemed to be correct. Still, Liu felt a strange incongruity to the numbers given on the ledger. Mr.Iago’s farm, only slightly over double the size of this one, had produced 331 bags of rice. 

Turning away from the ledger to his superior, Liu grabbed at the arm of Shi. “Sir, can I speak to you about something?” 

Shi turned likewise before whispering, “Of course, did you notice some discrepancy?” 

Liu nodded slowly, “the storehouses have enough space for 150 bags, yet the man reports only 98.” 

“Perfectly normal. Farm’s output often fluctuates greatly.” 

“But sir, the latest storehouse appears to have a fresh set of paint. It was definitely painted within the month, yet his three other storehouses have yet to be repainted.” 

For a moment Shi paused to ponder the significance of this observation. “So you believe he built this extra storehouse to store the excess, which he isn’t reporting to the government?” 

Another nod from Liu. “I’m certain.”      

An unfamiliar emotion flickered across Shi’s face before the man turned. “Can we check the store houses?”

A silence. The farm owner's hand hovered over the ledger. It shook before he replied. “Why yes, of course.” 

Stepping out behind the desk, the man led Liu and Shi down to the store houses. The man moved to open the oldest looking shed. The door opened with a great creak and revealed 50 bags of rice. Closing and locking the door, he moved to the next. Like the last, the door to this storehouse opened with a great effort. Inside were 48 bags. 

“You see, all of the bags accounted for.” As the key to the door left the lock of the second door, the man turned only to be met with Liu’s judgmental glare. 

“What about the final storehouse?” Liu spoke plainly. Standing next to Shi on the steps in front of the house, the pair cast long shadows across the man’s face.  

“Well it’s empty. I have no reason to use a third storehouse if two is enough,” the stout man replied.

He took a step to leave, but was stopped by Liu’s command. “Open it.” 

With great reluctance, the farm owner rattled the silver key into its place. There was a small crank before the door unfurrowed itself. Behind it sat 32 bags of rice. Nearly a third of the reported amount. 

The stout man tried to argue, but there was no argument to be made. It was Shi who spoke first. “You do know what you’ve done, haven’t you?” Shi left a pause for a response, but the response was obvious. “You’ve defrauded the empire of it’s rightful tax. For this the empire will take all goods not reported, and take double the regular tax.” 

“Of course, I promise it won’t happen ever again.” The man dropped to his knees and bowed to Shi. Waving the gentleman away, Shi motioned for Liu to follow. A confusion and anger was building in Liu. This wasn’t the proper punishment. The proper punishment was to forfeit *all* lands owned by the man’s family. While Liu pondered his decision, Shi called upon the soldiers to load the rice into the carts they had dragged behind them.

Mounting his horse, Liu could only continue to question Shi’s decision. “You’re wondering why I didn’t arrest him?” the tall man asked, smiling.

In shock, Liu nodded. 

“Do you know how low the reserves are in Delmia?” Shi’s pointed question was in an area that Liu had yet to read enough about to answer. 

“If a famine broke out, we could sustain the capital for less then two weeks. The capital alone. The two things Delmia requires most is not justice, but food and farmers.” Shi gave Liu a moment to absorb that fact.  

“Delmians may be the finest farmers in all of the empire, but they seldom submit to taxation. Farmers like Mr.Iago, and even this man. The ones that most Delmians would call Backuh and traitor, are far more valuable to the stability of this province then any amount of justice could ever provide. To kill him would not only lose one farm, but would lead those few loyal to the empire to turn against it.” 

Liu gave a silent nod. He could understand Shi’s idea, but it still didn’t sit right with him. Justice and the laws of the Empire should come above all, and the Empire could manage these resources much better than any simple-minded Delmian farmer. Just because Delmians refuse to submit didn’t mean the Empire should bend to their will. The servants of the Empire must uphold its laws and ideals. Only then could the longevity of the Empire be assured.
