#+title: Sarlanian
aka Old Trentanian. It is similar to english but with some norwegian influences phonetically, though it is actually the father language of English/New Trentanian.

Sarlanian is a simple language on the phonetic and grammar level, but in that simplicity words often become long. They are more predisposed to combining words in a very childish and intuitive way to make new words rather than making new words "from scratch".

o: "aw" as "long" or "dawn"
i: "er" as in "biker" or "flounder"
รถ: "oh" as in "or"
e: "eh" as in "day"
