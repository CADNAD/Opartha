Damian sat cross legged on a stone floor. Darkness surrounded him, save for the small candle Avador held under his face. “Come on kid, focus up. I know you can do it, I’ve seen it.” 

“I know. It’s just, not working,” Damian said. Between his two hands he held a small rabbit. In the darkness, the animal’s fluffy coat pushed against the teen’s grip.  

“Too bright?” Avador raised an eyebrow. “I can put the candle out if you want, kid. The dar-“ 

Damian held a hand out, cutting Avador off. “The darker the better. I know, you’ve said that everyday we’ve trained together.”  Though Damian appreciated the advice, something deeper, more substantial would have been nice. Avador never espoused philosophy as he had heard the other masters do. His advice and training was practical, and brute force. He drilled the same lessons and mantras into him day after day. 

“Kid, it’s the only real rule that matters. Forgot it and you’ll be dead before you know it.” Damian rolled his eyes, thinking his teacher couldn’t see. But Avador’s eyes were far better adjusted than Damian’s. 

“Come on kid, what is it you want? Forces be damned\[ 2021-04-06, 5:46 PM

Maybe not this especially considering Billy saying it later is literally punishable by death\], do you want me to lecture you like the others?”  The idea wasn’t horrible. Training hadn’t been the glorious heroism Damian thought he would be participating in. For a moment he had deluded himself into believing joining the Order of Tsuman would be some magnificent adventure. One where he could galavant around the world saving those in need, bettering lives. But so far it had consisted of hours spent on end inside a dark cave. Each day they had walked down to the garden, picked up a rabbit, then marched up the highest depths of Banuro. 

“What’d you want to know? You want me to tell about all the spirituality and what not? You want me to sit you down and talk to you about the Forces? You might think you do, but you don’t want it kid.” 

Damian had seem Avador gamble on more than one occasion, and he wouldn’t exactly trust his judgement. “Well, I say I do.” 

Avador chuckled a little, irking Damian. “Tell you what kid, you show me you can control the rabbit and I’ll give you l’ll give you all the lectures you want.”  

So he’d never get it. In two weeks he’d manage to only successfully control the animal once, on the first day. His hand ran over the spine of the animal, and he thumbed at the neck. Maybe if the attempt was good Avador would give him something. 

Damian took a deep breath, and felt the darkness around him, felt the darkness between him and the rabbit. It twitched in his hands. His heart slowed as he reached his mind across the shadow. The teen felt a part of him sheer from the rest, leaving his body and venturing across the black expanse. Then he felt another mind within his own. A quiet hum under his thoughts. He looked at Avador, willing the animal forward. It burst out from shadow and into the faint candlelight. Damian’s master scrambled back before hitting the edge of the cave wall. 

“Sly bastard. Guess I gotta give you the whole spiel now. Forces only know if I remember it now,” The older man rubbed his temple. “Release the rabbit, and we can go return it.” 

Damian’s mind reached across the darkness and pulled back the part of himself which had sheered away. His head spun and he fell over. A think hand caught him before he could hit the ground. When he opened his eye Avador’s wrinkled face filled his view. Bathed in orange candle light, the man’s face looked harder than usual. 

“Come on kid, you did good today. Let’s return the rabbit, get a bite to eat, then see you get a good night’s rest.”
