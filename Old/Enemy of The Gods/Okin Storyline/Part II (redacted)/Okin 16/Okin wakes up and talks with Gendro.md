“Ah, you’re awake.”

Gendro’s thin lips formed a wholesome smile. Miraculously, his face was spotless.

“G-Gendro---,” Okin groaned. His back and sides ached tremendously, and the gravity pulled him down into the bed and made it feel like a jagged rock. “I--- I’m so sorry.”

The Rothar shook his head. 

“It’s alright. I’m an Absorption Herald, remember, or is that memory of yours already failing? Frankly, I’m rather impressed that a man of your age can move that fast.”

Okin opened his mouth to protest, but stopped himself, instead smiled softly; but the smile was quickly pulled back by the weight in his heart.

“But I--- I caused you much pain,” Okin said. “I don’t know what has gotten into me.”

“I think whatever you are doing, it is too heavy a burden for one man to carry,” Gendro replied. “I know that I appear to not care, but I really do intend to perform my duty as a Rothar--- my duty as a friend.”

Okin placed his hand atop of the Rothar’s, but he couldn’t bear to look at Gendro’s face, scars or not. 

“Thank you, Gendro. And you truly are a good Rothar.”

There was silence from the Rothar, followed by a deep sigh.

“Okin, *please*. What is it you have gotten yourself into? I’ve been thinking about all that has been going on. Does it have something to do with Aldwin?”

“Aldwin is---“

*Meddling in the election,* Okin thought. *He’s meddling in the election and I have to stop him, a man I used to trust and follow, but who has killed to keep me from the Truth.* Why would Aldwin sacrifice that which he said he stood for--- all that The Citadel stand for?  Why would he push so hard for his incompetent son to get elected? And why would some dirty vagabond help stand against him?  

*I’ve already asked these questions a million times, and I still have no answers, and how long has it been? Perhaps I* should *tell Gendro.*

*But Gendro does not know the answer to any of these questions. What use would telling him do? None.*

Okin looked up into his friend’s light, begging eyes.

*None, except protecting what you used to hold dear, what used to define you. The Truth.*

“Aldwin is---“

Gendro leaned closer, his leg was bouncing up and down, slightly shaking the bed.

“Aldwin is heading back to Whenran. That’s why I asked for Trenton’s help, because Ariska is moving to the central station, under his command, and truthfully I want to stay in The Citadel for some time. But I’m not so sure that Aldwin would approve.”

“But--- why must we be so secretive? And it still doesn’t explain who those strange masked man were, and why they wanted to kill you,” Gendro said.

“I---,”

Okin scratched his head. 

“I’m not really so sure myself.
