“Let today be yet another day that serves your namesakes and your will.  By Olitheon, let today be another day of Knowledge and Wisdom.  By Nexon, let today be another day of Joy and Gratitude.  By Intillia, let today be another day of Peace and Selflessness.  And by Aredal, let today be another day of Truth and Justice.  Aventa.” 

Raising his palms to the air, the man dressed in a long, white and gold robe with a matching gold cap and pellegrina received thunderous applause from the crowd;  In front of him hundreds sat in long wooden pews. While a few near the front dressed in ornate robes--- not to dissimilar to his own ---most wore peasant’s clothing.  

In the front pew two young robed men, rose to their feet clapping vigorously.  They wore simple white robes of the same cut as Okin’s, although the man on the left, the older-looking one of the two, had a robe with golden cuffs and a golden collar.  

Smiling widely, the two men continued to clap as the back half of the church began to leave their pews.  The man leading the congregation bowed to the altar, and then walk away from the pews, exiting out a door behind the altar.  

“Phew," the younger of the two men wiped away the sweat from his forehead.  “I didn’t think he could go on any longer Okin.” 

“It wasn’t that long, he didn’t mince any words.  Your father gave an amazing liturgy," Okin replied. 

The younger man nodded. While it might have tricked others, Okin could tell it was half-hearted.  “Yeah, I guess it was good.”

*Previa, Previa, Previa,* Okin thought to himself. For all the knowledge and opportunity he had been blessed with, Previa had never seemed to use any of it to its full extent. “To spread the universal word proficiently, you must listen to others who have done so before you.  You’re lucky to have such an inspiring father.”

Nodding again, Previa replied, “I’ve heard that enough as is. I don’t need you piling on as well.”

Walking out of the pew, the two men turned to a door which led to the area of the church behind the chancel, out of sight from anyone in the main hall.  Closing the door behind them, the two men walked through a thin, plain hall, and into a small preparation room; Candles, robes, books and artifacts were all neatly organized in closets along the walls. The man who had led the congregation was there. Old and thin, he stood with good posture for his age, straight backed and with hands clasped behind his back.

“Impalias Aldwin, that was a very powerful liturgy," Okin said, prompting the Impalias to give a warm smile in return. 

“Thank you, Okin.  I am honoured that you attended the congregation," Aldwin replied. Although he spoke with a typically stiff voice, there was something strange about the way he spoke today. 

“Now, onto why I asked you here today," the Impalias said, looking at Okin.  “As you probably remember, in two weeks it is the tenth anniversary of the death of Lionel Gruissem.”  Okin and Previa both nodded solemly at the name.  “I would love to return home to perform the ceremony myself, but unfortunately The Citadel needs me during this crucial time of integration.  But, I am more than honoured to delegate the position to you, High Ather Okin. You have proven time and time again that you are a pious man, and wise above your years.”

Okin bowed his head.  “I am honoured that you have granted me this opportunity.  I will give everything I have to honour this great man, on the anniversary of his union with the Gods.”

“I am to join him, right?”  the younger man looked at his father, the Impalias, with wide eyes.

The Impalias’ smile faded.  “No. Only one Ather is required to perform the ceremony, and you are needed elsewhere, Ather Previa.”

“But--- but I knew Mr. Gruissem as a young boy! Even if just as an attendee, I would like to pay my respects---”

“No. The decision is final.  You will go with me to The Citadel, and Okin will travel to Metheno to perform the ceremony," Aldwin said gruffly. 

Letting out a disheartened sigh, Previa looked back to the floor.  Okin stood still, rather shocked at Aldwin’s decision.  *Since when did The Citadel need so many Athers on call?* Okin thought to himself.  It was not a time of war, in fact, this was the most prosperous time for The Citadel since its establishment.  And Previa was no warrior, nor a well-studied religious leader.  As Okin was supposed to mentor Previa, he was surprised that he would not be allowed to join him to perform a ceremony in their hometown.

*Perhaps it is family affairs.  It is clearly something important, I should not question it.* 

“Thank you again, Impalias Aldwin," Okin said, bowing.  

A smile returning to his face, Aldwin replied, “No, it is my honour, High Ather Okin.  In three days, two carriages will arrive at your quarters in Ariska.  One will take you and your Rothar to Metheno, Okin, and the other will take you directly to the Citadel, Previa.” 

“Yeah, okay," Previa said, turning away from his father and heading for the door that led back to the main hall of the cathedral.  Raising an eyebrow at Previa’s lack of respect, Okin turned back to Aldwin.  With a bow of the head, Okin thanked the Impalias one last time, and followed Previa out of the small room.
