Billy finished off the glass of beer with a lick of the lips. Perhaps the strangest thing this Captain Kiatus had done was offer booze to a prisoner. He’d entered into one of those strange ramblings about the world again, before having to rush off to attend to some duties. Didn’t really matter, anyways. Billy wasn’t listening. 

He looked out over the lower deck\[ Not sure about geography here\]. Allia, Damian and Benjamin were talking up that red-bearded pirate,\[ I don’t think he was introduced yet, but the wording implies he aws\] who sat with a mug on the table. He strut down to get a better earshot.

“You want us to take you to *Krinosas?* We saw you lot were flying off north, but we just thought you were stupid and got lost! We didn’t think you were *that* stupid!” The red-bearded pirate chuckled.

“Please,” Billy heard Allia’s whine. “You said Kiatus was adventurous, and he definitely doesn’t seem afraid of danger. We don’t even need you to come with us, we just want to be dropped off on the continent.”

“Well you’re right about that. We’ve been to Krinosas, once, on the eastern side, though. Kiatus was after some legend or another. We all stayed on the boat, though, save for a few,” the pirate tilted his head toward two of others Billy had seen earlier--- one with a stump arm, and one with two peg legs, both plucking at food while sitting on the floor. Despite their unfortunate condition, they wore the same vests and leathers as the other pirates, and gold earrings even shook from the peg-legged man’s ears as he joked with his fellow. “There wasn’t really much, it was just kind of a pain in the ass maneuvering around all those rocks and finding a place to moor the damn ships,” redbeard finished.

“Please. You can drop us off anywhere along the coast,” Allia clasped her hands together.

The pirate raised a red eyebrow. “Krinosas is a big ass continent. If you’re going to such a wild place, I’d thought there’d be like a really specific-ass location you’d wanna be.”

“That’s ‘cause they have no fucking clue where whatever they’re after even is,” Billy finally joined in, hands in his pockets as he leant against the banister. “Yet another good reason why there’s no way in hell we’re going.”

Allia’s pleading eyes narrowed into disdain. 

“You know what?” she stood to her feet and slammed a hand on the table. “I’m just tired of all your shit. The three of us all agree that we’re going to do one thing, and then you jam your stupid, grumpy head into the gears and completely screw us over! You say that you want to protect your brother, but you just end up putting us in more danger!”

“Seems to me like I got us out of being killed in a wild jungle that no one’s ever explored! Yes, you broke us out of jail, and I’m very thankful, but since then all you’ve done is bring us into harm’s way!” Billy shouted back.

Benjamin reached out a thick arm, blocking Allia from Billy. “Look, Billy. She saved our lives, and we agree to at least try to help her find what she is looking for.”

That was a mouthy sentence, coming from Benjamin. He must really believe in this--- and he must’ve been getting really emotional, which was blocking his clarity. Apathasawians only used more words when they were getting emotional. 

“You know what?” Allia said. “I never even wanted your help. If you want to so bad, you can go off with these pirates and get drunk for the rest of your life.”

Billy grinded his teeth together. “You know that I can’t leave my brother behind.”

Allia snorted. “My brother this, my brother that. Have you ever even *listened* to him for a second? Listened to what *he* wants?”

Billy charged forward, slamming both hands on the table, only barely being held back by Benjamin. “He’s my brother! We’ve always been together, I’ve *always* looked out for him! You can’t just come in and think you can take him from me just because you waved your magic fucking hands to save our asses once!”

Allia’s expression of mild frustration was breaking into one of crushed sadness. Good. She needed to hear this.

“You just saved us because it was easy for you! Because it was what needed to be done for your little crazy cult plan! You don’t care about any of us, it’s just about those fucking artifacts, because you’re just like the rest of them! It’s just about *power*, about *control!* It’s just*---“*

There was a loud screeching against the deck. Billy jerked his head, ready to direct his anger at whichever idiot interrupted his much-needed rant. 

Billy’s train of rage screeched to a stop.  Damian had stood up from the table, his head hung low.

Billy watched with a wide mouth as his brother shoved past him.

“I don’t know about you, but that---,” Allia pointed a shaky finger at the sky. “That was my entire life. And I threw it all away to save *you.*”

She tried to blink away the tears in her eyes, but Billy saw the water drip from them. A sharp pang of guilt stabbed at his chest, but he breathed in sharply, hoping the air would crush it. He turned away and ran up to his brother.

“Hey, hey,” Billy reached a hand to Damian’s shoulder. “Is everything all right?”

Damian spun around, pushing away his brother’s hand.

“Why can’t you just *try* to get along?” he pleaded.

“I---,” Billy’s eyes drooped, and he gradually reached his hand out again. “The world is a dangerous place, Damian. Even dad---,” 

“Ever since dad died we’ve done nothing but hide and run! I just--- I just want to do something *more* for once, you know?"

Damian looked down at the ground and away from Billy. It was clear he was trying to hide the tears, but Billy saw them fall from his cheek. 

Damian walked away from Billy, back towards the far end of the ship where Allia had gone.

Billy reached a trembling hand to his brother’s shoulder. He was failing to hold back his own eyes from watering now.

But as soon as his fingers even got close to touching, Damian threw it aside, not even turning around to face Billy as he did so. 

He wanted to hate. He so desperately craved to *hate* her. But Damian--- he was always innocent, he was always good. And not even in a prideful or righteous manner. He was just--- *good.*

And so, there wasn’t even a little voice telling him that he was in the wrong. It was silent. But he still knew.

And that--- fuck, it made it even worse.
