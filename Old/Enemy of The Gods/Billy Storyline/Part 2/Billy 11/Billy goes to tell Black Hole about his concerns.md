The rocky halls of the mountain were ever so confusing. Everything looked the same, with that imperfect carved-out texture, and there were no directions or signs. Just more of those bustling crazies.

Jerel had been the only one who offered Billy any sort of guidance when it came to navigating this place, but it’d take a whole bottle of whisky before he’d even consider speaking to that sycophant again. The man’s incessant chatter and groveling was tiring, and Billy had to expend mental energy not to ruin his stupid smile with a fist to the face.

He turned down one of the wide carved-out caves. Here, there were smaller arches covered by curtains--- each with a coloured symbol --- that separated smaller rooms from the main cavern. The symbols didn’t mean anythingt to Billy, but he was pretty sure Benjy was in one of the rooms.

He raised his hand to motion to a passerby, a tall man with short brown hair. The man stopped, smiling.

“Hello, I am...uh, new here,” Billy said. “Do you possibly know where the Transportation Heralds would be training?”

The man nodded. “You’re going the right way. They’re in the middle of this tunnel arc, and--- oh, I’m guessing you don’t know how to read the ancient hieroglyphs,” he said, putting his fingers to his chin. “Well, the one for Transportation looks a little like...a snowflake, I guess, except the ends of all the wings are moving in the same direction.” 

The man tried to draw the symbol in the air, and Billy just nodded along.

“I-I’m sure you’ll know it when you see it,” the man said, and he continued on his way,

Billy scratched his head, trying to redraw the weird symbol as the man had. Shrugging and shaking his head, Billy flicked his hand to blow away his imaginary drawing.

He had to admit, it was impressive how many training rooms were here, and by extension, how many Heralds must’ve been on this island. Billy remembered how shocked he was when he found out that both him and Damian were Heralds, and Benjy was the only other Herald that Billy knew well. And yet, here was a whole flying island of them. How did they get so many? Were they all prisoners like Billy? How long had they been living here?

*And they all seem to be super kooky*\[ Unsure if this is the right word\]*.* 

Billy muddled in his thoughts, continuously checking the symbols that were printed on the curtain doors. Thankfully, most of them looked completely different from the one the man had drawn.

A little while later, he happened on the section of the swirling snowflake-like ones the man had described. There were a few of them, and Billy had to peek inside to find out that Benjamin wasn’t in those ones. Thankfully, Billy found his friend training soon enough.

The practice room was large enough so that neither Benjamin nor his master noticed Billy peek in through the curtains. It looked like they were in the middle of a drill. The massive, hulking\[ Repetition Kinda?\] man stood several heads above his master. Evelyn--- the blonde woman who they had met upon arriving at the island ---was about as tall as the three practice dummies that stood in a semi circle around her. Next to her was a tall stack of thin discs.

“Now we will get a sense of what it is like to face multiple opponents,” Evelyn said. “A Transportation Herald specializes as a shield on the battlefield, and a great one can counter the attacks of dozens of men, even multiple other Heralds.”

Benjy nodded, lunging back from his master and the dummies, raising his hands in a fighting stance, but with open palms.

“Sometimes, though, offense is the best defense. For every shot that you miss, the enemy gains more time to attack, and the more firepower you have to deal with. We will simulate that effect here as well. I expect you to dodge most of the projectiles by redirecting them at the dummies. If you do not hit them, the attacks will grow more frequent until you are overwhelmed,” she smiled. “Now, let’s see how long you can last.”

She raised her hand casually, fingers fluttering in the air, and two discs\[ Idk if they have a special description. If so we should add it here. Space Crystals?\] from the ample pile raised up behind her head.

Evelyn flicked her wrist and the two discs shot forward, just slightly faster than a throwing axe\[ You used this, but im not sure if its a good way to measure speed\]. His friend jumped back, and held both arms forward. The two discs shot back in opposite directions, nailing the dummies in the head. They staggered for a bit like a spring before returning back to a stable equilibrium.

The woman shot two discs again, but this time in two opposite curves, both swinging around the room and heading for the opposite sides of Benjamin’s torso. He focused on one at a time, sending the left one barreling for the dummy’s chest, and narrowly redirecting the right one before it hit his own. It slammed into the dummy, dropping to the ground.

While he was still showing off his finish, she had already sent out two more bolting right towards him. This time, Benjamin swung his palms out back toward them, but didn’t have time to push them in the right direction, sending them both flying to the ceiling, completely missing the dummies.

Still, Billy couldn’t help but awe. He had never seen Benjy’s Heraldry, or any Transportation Herald for that matter, in a combat setting. 

Evelyn grinned, and four discs flew up behind her, Benjamin squatting down, readying his hands. They all flew at him at once, each shooting out in a different directions and heights, the two outer ones curving in a long arc towards his side.

Billy never thought his friend could be so graceful. He had to slow time to truly admire his precision and speed. Had he gotten so good after only a few days of training, or did he possess this skill all along?

One by one, Benjamin focused on the individual disc, sending them in graceful arcs at the heads of the dummies. In reality, it was all rapid motions, the man flicking his wrists back and forth and efficiently moving his arms around to deflect the discs as they grew near. But with time slowed, Billy could see the man’s focus, the fractions of the second when the disc itself was grabbed from its former master and relinquished control to Benjamin, hovering still in the air until it was pushed away in another direction.

The last two came hurling at Benjamin from opposite sides at the same time, and his redirection was panicked and ended up grazing just past the dummy, hitting the back wall.

Evelyn shot out more. Now, it seemed there was no start or end to her onslaught. Benjamin stopped even trying to aim at the dummies, focusing on just reflecting and avoiding. She started throwing discs at him with no discrimination, floating up fallen ones that had hit the dummies and targeting Benjamin.

Benjamin did a remarkable job dodging the projectiles, considering he was a massive target. But he was no Control Herald, and eventually he couldn’t keep up. He jumped back on one leg, narrowly evading a set of discs. Another came zooming at him, and he leaned backward as to dodge it, but his singular leg failed to support him. With swinging arms, he tried to rebalance himself, but it was no use. He fell back-first onto the hardwood floor with a *thump*.

All the discs in the room paused in midair, dropping o the ground. Evelyn sauntered over to the fallen Benjamin, and Billy blew into the room completely, his eyes wide.

Benjy’s hearty laugh echoed against the rocky walls.

Evelyn smiled. “You did *really* well. Need a hand?”

The dark-skinned man crunched up. “Don’t think you could,” he smiled.

“You’d be surprised,” she said, smirking.

The master didn’t grab onto Benjamin but simply lifted her hand to the sky, and the massive man hovered off the ground, his arms squirming, him giggling as if he were being tickled.\[ To Childish? Better option to characterize his wonder and excitment imo\]

“Aha, forgot!” he continued laughing, slowly descending and landing on his feet.\[ To Childish? Better option to characterize his wonder and excitment imo\]

“We all do, sometimes,” she smiled. “Well, we will have a short break. I think there is someone here to see you,” she said, gesturing to Billy.\[ To Childish? Better option to characterize his wonder and excitment imo\]

“Ah, Billy!” Benjy said, running up like a schoolchild excited to tell his parents about his first day of school. The image made Billy crack a smile.\[ To Childish? Better option to characterize his wonder and excitment imo\]

“I gotta admit, you looked pretty good out there,” Billy smirked. “Well, as good as a man can look being thrown around by a woman a third his size.”

“You try fight Evelyn, Billy. We’ll see,” Benjy chuckled, slapping a massive hand onto Billy’s shoulder. “Actually, yes Billy. You *try*! Think they’ll let you train your shooting. Have learned so much, and so much fun, too.”

Billy scratched his chin. “Yeah, I know, it looks like you’re having a good time, and apparently Damian is too, though I haven’t been able to keep track of the little bastard. I’m just---I’m worried that these people are out to get us, you know? It’s already suspicious, this crazy cult on a cinking flying island, and what about the fact that up until the last second, they were going to wipe our minds, or who knows what? And I still haven’t even figured out how that Allia girl even found us! Like, what game are they playing, man?”

“Allia, she try help us. Obvious, Billy! She break you out jail, fly us to island, argue against wiping our brains! If she not here, you and Damian dead,” Benjy said.

Billy sighed, and his lips formed into a scowl. “I---I just think maybe she’s trying to take Damian away, that they all are.”

Billy leaned in closer, and watched Evelyn. She was just leaning against the back wall, fiddling with some wooden balls using those Space powers. 

“Y’know how powerful Damian is. I think--- I think they saw that. I think--- I think they’re using her as an in to y’know, take his mind,” Billy whispered.  “And I’m the only one standing in their way, so they’re trying to subdue me, too.”

“If she was, she could have thrown you off of flying ship,” Benjy said. “And they could’ve wiped your brain, locked you in jail. Feed you to whatever thing that fly this island.”

Billy nodded. It’s true, would they really wait that long just to trap him? It *did* seem unlikely. However, there was an air to these people that seemed a little...*extreme*. I mean, who lives on a flying island in the middle of the sky?

Now Benjamin leaned down to whisper to Billy. “I think there is something bad between her and that man---uh, Tae-done? \[ This is deliberate, right?\]Maybe *he* hide something, but so many people here, mostly good. T’is opportunity, Billy. You should take.”

Apathasawians, always about *opportunity*. Maybe Benjamin was right, though. If there was anyone who Billy could trust, who actually wanted cared about his wellbeing, it was Benjy.\[ Maybe all the Benjamin in Billy chapters should be replaced by Benjy. If he does think of him in that name then we should replace it since it will feel more in character\]

“Alright,” Billy said, patting Benjamin on the back. “I’ll think about it. Have a good time.”\[ Maybe all the Benjamin in Billy chapters should be replaced by Benjy. If he does think of him in that name then we should replace it since it will feel more in character\]

Benjy smiled, and ran back over to resume his training. Billy ducked back through the curtains.
