In the cramped cell, silence filled the air between Billy and Damian. Billy sat on a thin bed of hay, back pushed against mossy stone. He’d been staring at the ceiling, trying to re-picture the image he couldn’t quite grasp during the trial---the image of his father’s death.

To his right, a wooden door was set into the wall. A small window of irons bars in the door let in dim torch light. The faint croaking of bugs came through a further grate in the ceiling. Outside the two guards chattered as they played Tallow--- a common children’s game across Wreathward.

“Billy... do you think we’re going to die?” Damian sat across from Billy, his shag of brown hair tucked between his legs, arms draped lazily over his knees. 

Billy twisted his lip into a frown. Under the low light, he hoped that his expression was hidden. 

Brining his gaze to the iron bars, Billy spoke. “Prob’ly not, we’ve been in worse.” His voice and body was motionless, near catatonic. 

“You’re lying, aren’t you?” Damian brought his head up. Billy glanced to the boy. His left eye was bruised shut. His one good eye looked helpless, wavering under the torch light. “Billy. Don’t lie to me. Am I going to die?” 

Billy looked away from the boy’s bruised face. His jaw tensed, and his throat swallowed dry. Though he avoided eye contact, he could still feel Damian burying his one good eye into him. Billy grimaced, for a moment he wondered if it was time to give up the act. He wondered if in their final moments, he should tell the little brother he had held to his chest through all these years the truth. The idea buzzed around the inside of his head like an angered bee. But like a pest, he crushed it in under his heel. 

“One little misstep, and already you don’t fucking trust me?” He asked. Damian recoiled at Billy’s words, the boy tucking his head back between his legs.

“Of course I still trust you,” Damian said. His voice was a soft mumble. Hearing the boy’s voice, there was a small pang in his heart at the reply; a sensation he hadn’t felt for a long time. Guilt, weakness. Identifying the feeling, a memory of his father came to Billy. 

“Guilt is an excuse to not stand by your decisions. Think before you act, and you will never feel guilty.” It was a lesson his father often taught. *I should have listened to you more often*, Billy thought to himself. But he couldn’t quite push the feeling away. Despite barely seeing Damian, Billy could tell the teen was sulking under his hair. If he wasn’t, he wouldn’t be Damian. Soft, intelligent even. but weak. It was Damian’s true curse; Not his Dark Heraldry, but his foolish weakness. Under pressure he would always fold, just like he had in that court room.

*Oh, Billy, I can’t lie!* Billy imitated Damian’s earlier comment in his mind, mocking the words. *If you had enough spine to stand up to them, we could be on our way home already.* Billy’s frustration slowly fermented. They weren’t on their way home, instead they were stuck awaiting their death. 

And not even a decent death. They weren’t feasting on their last meal, or surrounding themselves with women, or even dying honourably in war. Instead they sat, silent, backs pressed against cold mossy stone. 

Billy glared at Damian, and so the boy’s face gave an expression like a guilty child unsure of what he did wrong. In his mind, Billy shook his head. Of course it was just *illogical* to have relied on Damian in the courtroom. The boy may have been misguided, but their safety, as always, was Billy’s responsibility. And *he* had failed. The only responsibility that father had entrusted him with...

Billy slammed his knuckles against the cold, hard slabs. He subsequently clutched his fist in agony. But at the image of father was consumed by the pain.

“Billy!” Damian reached forward.

“Shhh!” Billy lifted a finger to his mouth, and Damian lurched backwards.

Billy stared at Damian with an expression of expectance, but there was nothing. The room filled only with the sound of water dripping, lamps flickering, and guards chattering. 

The truth was, Billy just wanted some peace and quiet. 

But instead, as always, his mind just focused *more* on the sounds. He heard mumblings of the guards laughing about their stupid game. Yes, it was all just a funny little *game* to them, propping up the system that they called Wreathward and Versalism no matter who paid the cost.

“Rashvanah was great.... Yeah, yeah, they are *very* welcoming to new families there.... 

How could they live like this, knowing that they had just sentenced two men, one barely older than a youth, to a brutal death based on only a few harsh judgements? How could they *sit* and pretend this was normal? And that their ridiculous “gods” wanted this? How could they sit outside the cell for hours and not even think *once* about what *bullshit* this all was?

And it was *all* of them. These people destroyed lives on a *whim* and then claimed it was not only normal, but *holy.* And if they didn’t, they still listened and supported those who did. *Millions* contempt in offering their fellows to the slaughter with a smile on their face as long as their “gods” condoned it.

“...well, I do want to give Anya a break,” the guard’s chatter continued outside. Billy clenched his fist--- why were *they* awarded such normal, decent lives?

“...it does sound nice. I am wherever Ather Lissom is, though.” 

And why did they follow their “leaders” so blindly?

“...I’ve known him all my life. Perhaps the greatest man I’ve known.”

And most of all, why were they given *respect* for promoting such harmful dogma?

“Ha! That’s it. I’ve got a---“

There was a *whip* in the wind, and then only silence. 

Billy’s eyes instinctively locked on the door. The faint torch light retreated. Only the dim moonlight still shone through the bars in the upper window.

“What was that?”one of the guards ask.

“I have no idea,” Billy just barely heard the other reply.

A deep feeling within his bones emerged, screaming at every muscle to run, hide, to preserve himself. But where was there to run; what did he have to defend himself? Scrambling to his knees, Billy crawled hurriedly to Damian. 

He prodded the teen’s side, “Damian! Something’s coming. It’s dark as shit, so no more excuses, alright?” Billy spoke in a hushed whisper. 

“Did you see anything?” Billy heard the guards muffle about. 

“No. Just the Light go out.” his friend replied. “Wait! There, do you see that?” 

The two guards drew their swords. “Istar Julie, now is no time for games,” the first guard yelled out. Billy could feel himself tense up, something about the stale air had changed. He couldn’t quite place the change, save for the danger it carried. 

“Get your ass up Damian,” Billy again prodded his companion’s side. Again, Damian sat unresponsive to his pleas. Suddenly, the hall outside filled with a low white light, and the clanging of blade on blade. 

“Who in the name of the Four are you?” The first guard asked again. No reply from the stranger came, instead the sickly sound of a blade plunging into flesh followed. Billy could hear blood gurgling, as one of the two guards struggled to cling onto life. As the stabbed guard continued to struggle, the fighting seemingly stopped. 

“He still has time. Take him, tell no one of what happened here. Swear it on your gods.” The assailant’s voice was feminine, shaky, and breathy. A hint of venom dripping around her lips at the word “gods”. 

Billy found the proposal laughable, a fool’s gambit to free herself from the guilt of killing. Killing wasn’t easy, nor was it hard. It was simply something you lived with. It seemed this girl’s shoulder was too weak to bear the burden. 

As Billy predicted, the girl’s offer was rejected. Instead, the second guard roared towards her. From his position on the ground, he couldn’t see either of the them. White light danced around, strobing the room as the source moved. There was blaring flashes, followed by intense blackness. Two swords clashed. Then a low grunt and a stumble. Billy heard another swing, yet there was no sound of metal clashing. Instead a loud screeching sound came as another substance blocked the sword. A blunt thud, likely a kick, sent one of the two crashing into the wall. Again the fleshy sound returned as a sword was sank into flesh. Billy held his breath silently as he awaited confirmation of the result. A wet coughing answered his questions.

“Aredal--- damn--- you,” the guard said. Each word sounded like a struggle and was barely audible. A sharp metallic slice silenced the guard. Drip, drip, drip. Silence hung in the air, only punctuated by the dripping of water, and now blood. 

Again, Billy shook Damian. Despite the pressing threat, Damian reminded silent. His eyes were disinterested, starting at the cracks in the stone floor. Outside the barred windows, the white light slowly faded. Again the room was plunged into the faint summer moonlight, translucent white strips illuminating the two. His his heart palpated  against his chest, choking him. His hairs stood on edge as the stranger’s footsteps approached. A faint light moved towards them, casting faint shadows from the iron bar across the cell. Looking up at the bars Billy, could finally see the stranger. 

The figure wore a brown cloak, hood drawn deep over their face, darkness shrouding their outline. Under the hood, two diamond blue eyes shone. *They can’t actually be shining?* Billy thought. Yet they were. It sent a chill down his spine to look at the girl’s strange eyes. Strange, not only for their glow, but their origin. Thin and pulled tight against her skin, the girl had foreign, eastern eyes, rare even in the most populace centres of Wreathward. 

“Gift of the Forces, you’re both here still,” the girl said. Damian perked up at her words.

“What did you say?” He asked, scrambling to his feet. Quickly, Billy reached out to grab Damian. His fingers grazed the hatched texture of the teen’s shirt, Damian managing to just avoid his grip. He stumbled, crashing against wood door. The wood bent, bulging in the iron frame.

The girl took a step back, sliding her weight to her back foot. Despite the shroud around her face, her expression was clearly illuminated by those two glowing eyes. The girl’s mouth was slightly agape, pursed at the sides. Her eyes had widened, and she was starting back at Damian. The girl’s shoulder dropped and Billy readied to jerk Damian away from the door. But instead of going for her weapon, the girl relaxed her arms and bore a smile

“Gift of the Forces, yo-“ Damian cut the girl off before she could finish. 

The teen’s voice was excited as he spoke his interruption, “Yes, yes! Gift of the Forces!” Under the dim moonlight Billy could see his friend’s wide eyes. Despite the bruising around them, the younger teen’s inquisitive nature shone clear as day, clear as the girl’s glowing eyes. “You’re part of the Order of Tsuman, aren’t you?”

The girl nodded slowly. Her mouth closed, pursing down into a frown. *Was that the wrong thing to say?* Billy thought to himself. Billy would often have to chase after Damian, apologizing at those he had *supposedly* unintentionally upset. But this girl wasn’t one who Billy could apologize to and be done with. She had just single handily killed two Rothars, which was no easy feat, even with the element of surprise.  

“Yes, I am,” the girl finally said. It was only now that Billy finally noticed her accent. It was subtle, in fact the girl seemingly had a flawless Nairfalkian accent. But underneath he could hear the hints of another, unplaceable accent. Her voice lifted and fell in tones, a melodic quality to her words. But not the harsh Gaolein tones, or the rolled tones of a Delmian. Rather her underlying voice--- the girl’s true accent ---was like a mix of every accent Billy had ever heard. But the fact that she had an accent to cover up only alerted Billy more.

“I’ve...” the girl paused, “I’ve come to rescue you.” Billy shot a bewildered look to Damian. 

“Rescue us? And take us where?” Billy asked. He was on his feet now, striding to the tiny window in the door. Lightly pushing Damian aside, he peered through the bars at the stranger. She took another small step back. 

“Or are we just free to go?” Billy asked, causing the girl to pause. *I guess she’s just a timid little girl, Billy thought.* A timid little girl which terrified his most animal instincts.

“Where will you go?” The girl said. “You cannot stay here, or in Wreathward. With the spectacle you made, that High Ather will not allow you to go so easily. Will you flee over the mountains to Delmia? I doubt you could survive the journey. You would be wanted men in the Tzen Empire. Perhaps you would flee by boat? That does seem the safest option.” The girl’s mouth circled into a smirk. Her audacity.

“We’ll go home,” Damian said from behind Billy. Glancing over his shoulder, Billy could see him standing tall, or as tall as he could. But his posture was shaky, feet too close together, and hands shaky. His voice betrayed his faux confidence as well. 

The girl took a step forward. “Go home? Well, I suppose that’s a good path.” She sheathed her sword with a flourish and took the door’s lock in her hand. 

“You didn’t grab the keys, you dumbass,” Billy told her as he watched her examine the lock. 

“Oh yes, I suppose I didn’t,” the girl said absent-mindedly. She ran her hands along the cast iron, its dark black contrasting against her pale skin, a golden bracelet with a glowing yellow crystal clanged against the metal. Suddenly, a stream of light became visible under her skin, the bright glow overshadowing the dark iron bars. Snaking its way through her veins the light pooled in her index fingers. A pure white, like the glow in her eyes. A screeching sound came as the light shot out of her index finger. Hitting the metal it shot through, even ripping through the wood of the door and burrowing a blackened hole into the stone next to Billy. The rising charring of smoking wood rose to his nose. 

Damian jumped back into a crouch, shielding his eyes with an arm, and while Billy wasn’t as cowardly as his friend, he too needed to cover his face with a hand. For a moment, Billy stood frozen. His mind slowly replayed the events, doing his best to grip what he had seen. A Light Herald. She must be. The way the light had flowed through her veins, the strange glow of her eyes. That must have been that oppressing feeling he had felt earlier.

The girl cursed under her breath, but spoke to Billy casually, much more casually than any Wreathwardian women dare speak to Billy. “I suppose I did not require the key.” 

The girl pulled the lock away, and with it the cell door. Swinging open, Billy was greeted by the suffocating darkness of the basement. Here, not even moonlight shone through. In fact, the only light in the room came from the girl herself, from those glowing eyes. 

Hesitantly, Billy took a step out. Though it was hard to see, Billy could see make out the forms of both of the dead Rothars. One lay close to the door, blood seeping through the cracks of his chest plate. In the centre of the plate was the symbol of the God Nexon. Two equilateral triangles joined to form the shape of an hour glass. *Freedom, destiny, joy, the three tenants of Nexon, the three tenants I once followed,* Bily though to himself. Five Gods, one Betrayer, one war, and Four left to worship. Unconsciously, the lesson drilled into him by his father and his tutors rushed back into his brain. But he didn’t have tutors, he had Athers. Religious fanatics who took every opportunity to breach and convert. But his father had respected them, respected their knowledge and their opinions. Maybe that was what had gotten him killed. 

“Quick now, I have no idea when they will return. It would be best if we were not here when they do,” the girl said. Billy blinked and repeated the girls words in his head. He cursed himself, he had been doing that too often recently. Staring, thinking, drifting off into thought.  

She motioned with her arm. Shrouded in a black cloak, she was almost invisible. Her face floated, inhuman in the darkness. “Must I drag you out of here the same way you were dragged in here?” She asked, more annoyed now. 

Her eyes darted from them to the entrance, and it was subtle, but she was definitely clenching her jaw. This wasn’t part of her plan, was it? *Of course she doesn’t know what she’s gotten herself into, she’s just a child.* How old could she be? She acted like she was barely a teen, yet her face, shrouded in darkness, looked well past twenty. 

Damian moved, following the girl’s motions. Was he really following this weird girl? Had she already made such a mark on the cowardly boy?

A few steps way, Damian turned. “Come on, Billy,” he said. His voice was louder and more determined than usual.

“Yeah. I’m coming,” Billy replied. Jogging up, he pushed past Damian and the girl, towards the light. 

“And where exactly do you intend on going now?” The girl was close behind Damian. She was almost biting at his heels. 

Billy continued through the darkness, speaking forward. “We’ll go back to the docks. Find a ride out of this shit hole.”

“A good idea, if you can find a ship.”

“I can,” Billy said. “And you’re gonna what? Follow us all the way there?” 

Billy heard the girl’s cloak shift in a shrug. Something about the action annoyed him, couldn’t she at the least spare some level of will? “Perhaps, I will see where the Forces take me.”

Force this, Force that, would she ever shut up?

“I’m sure Benjamin will still be there, right?” Damian asked from behind. The boy’s voice had lost its previous metal. Instead it shook, wavered like normal. 

“That bastard better be,” Billy said. The light was growing out in front of him. It poured out, bathing Billy in pale moonlight as he ascended the stairs. Breaking out of the ground, he found himself at the back of the church. It was quiet, the small croak and buzzing of insects the only sound in the night. Then the thumping of Damian’s boots, but not the girl’s. She was as silent as the night. 

“A full moon,” Billy said under his breath as he looked up. He had lost track of time down in the cell, but seeing the moon hanging central in the sky he knew that they’d been locked up for about six hours now. Four hours too many, if Benjamin had kept his word. But there was a chance.

Turning southward, towards the sea, Billy began to run. “Come on, let’s see if that bastard waited for us.”
