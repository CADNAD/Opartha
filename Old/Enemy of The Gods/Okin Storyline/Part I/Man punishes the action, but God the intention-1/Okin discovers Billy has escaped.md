“Okin!” 

Okin awakened from his deep slumber. The room was still dark despite the open window. A bell rung in the distance, and knocking sound pounded at his door. 

“Okin!”

Rubbing his eyes, he pushed himself out of bed and sauntered over to the door, pulling it open. Sweaty, hot and red, Gendro’s face burst into the room, almost hitting Okin face-first.

“Okin...Okin...," Gendro said. “Okin, they’re gone.”

“What? Who’s gone?” Okin replied. 

“Billy and Damian, Okin. They somehow escaped the cell... and killed the guards.”

*Billy... why? I feel--- ashamed? Or divided? By escaping--- by committing murder--- you relieve me from the duty of deciding whether you were a murderer or not; a duty which I wanted at first but now feel unworthy to carry out. Damian being a Dark Herald was surprising, but not enough to determine your guilt, Billy. This--- this must mean that you were guilty, that Justice has not been served--- but yet, I feel a weight lifted off my shoulders. Is this a Deception of Deionis or Tregale? Or a divine intervention from the Gods?*\[ 2021-01-08, 5:15 PM

Change this maybe\]

Okin’s train of thought was broken by Gendro’s stare and laboured breathing. He realized how urgent the situation was; he didn’t have time to mull over his internal battles right now. 

“Was there any sight of them? Anything? It must be close to sunrise now, how long have they been gone?” 

Gendro looked up, finally catching his breath. “We have no idea, High Ather. The Rothars on watch are all--- they’ve all been sent to the realms of the Gods. They left little sign of a trial--- nothing intelligible. I went to check on the prisoners this morn ing, and that’s when I found the lock destroyed, the cell empty.”

Okin turned away from Gendro, placing a hand on his forehead. “There is no way. We took away his weapon--- the strange gun from Apathasaw--- and even the guards there didn’t have the key! You said--- you said the lock was destroyed?”

Gendro nodded. “Yes, Okin. It wasn’t opened using a key--- it was almost as if was blasted off by a musket, although I even doubt that would break a lock of that caliber. The men were dead from stab wounds--- but we patted down both prisoners.”

Okin turned back towards the door, pushing past Gendro.

“Come on, we’re going to the cell.”
