As Billy emerged from the lower deck, where he had slept away the time since Damian alerted him in a drunk stupor, onto the main deck, he shielded his eyes. 

They had flown so far up that one might think they would soon be able to touch the moon. Billy didn’t dare look down at the cloud bed below them. Why in the Twelve Heraldries they were up here, Billy had no idea. Was this strange cult really so secretive that a few of their members---who appeared to be relatively low-ranking---couldn’t be spotted?

Even after taking yet another coat, Billy shivered. There was a consistent blowing sound of a light breeze, although he was so bundled up he couldn’t feel the wind. The entire crew had disappeared below deck, save for the helmsman---who seemed to never to leave the deck of the ship. It might’ve had something to do with those slimy tentacles wrapped around his arms and legs from the massive blob that apparently had lifted them up all this way.

At the very front of the ship, Allia stood, arms clasped behind her back, staring forward. For some reason, Damian was sitting on a barrel at her side, and even covered in an ungodly amount of coats and scarfs, his lack of confidence was glaring.

Billy stormed past the strange helmsman, his purposefully hammering his feet to alert Allia of his presence. It was successful. 

“You didn’t tell me that we were trying to fly into the sun,” Billy said. Allia didn’t crack a smile, and instead turned back to stare at the forward horizon.

“So you broke us out of jail just so we could freeze to death?” Billy asked, getting up to stare at the side of her face as she continued to stare forward. “Alright,” he turned to his brother. “Do you have any idea what’s going on here?”

“Yeah,” Damian said. He was fiddling with a small sheet in his lap. “Allia says we should be at our destination shortly.”

“Ah---what?” Billy sputtered. He looked around, trying to keep track of where they were going. From the position of the sun, they should be heading north, but he had lost track of their exact path. 

“So we’re starting our descent?” Billy asked. It still seemed idiotic to go up this high. “Where are we going, lady? Cinking Krinosas?”

It was as if he’d never asked the question. Part of him feared this girl---while the more he found out about her the less likely it seemed she was in charge of anything, there was a strange sense of dark majesty to her.

He turned to Damian, who was looking down at the little card he was holding. 

“What is that?” Billy asked, taking it from Damian’s hand. It was a little grey image of---nothing? It was pointless, but it definitely wasn’t *drawn* poorly, in fact it looked rather fine, just depicted nothing. It was a strangely intricate scribble.

Billy looked back to Allia, shaking his head. Perhaps he’d have to put his foot down---

She began to glow again. Billy jumped back. There weren’t any poles to hide behind on this part of the ship. He took Damian and pulled him behind the boy’s own seat.

She raised a palm to the sky, and a brilliant pillar of golden light shot out from it. Billy crouched down further behind the barrel, shielding his eyes.

*What is this crazy girl doing, using her powers when we’re ten million metres in the air?* Billy thought, peeking out from between his fingers. The bar of light, now more focused, still shone upwards. Whatever she was doing, it was clear by her unmoving stance that she probably wasn’t going to kill anybody, despite her instability.

“Okay,” Billy said, sneaking out from behind the barrel towards the girl, hands in front of his face, still squinting. “What the cink are you doing?”

“Being a guiding light,” she replied, her eyes still focused straight ahead. Aredal, how highly did this girl think of herself?

Billy crept forward until he was standing next to her, at the edge of the ship. She was unblinking, and Billy followed the path of her gaze.

As suspected, there was *nothing* ahead of them. Just a wide array of fluffy, light grey clouds out in the distance. An extremely extensive formation, far above the rest of the cloud beds, which seemed a whole galaxy below them.

Billy squinted further against the light. Then he blew around, looking around the deck---the card was right there, next to the barrel where he had dropped it. It was a wonder it hadn’t blown away; the wind sounded ever more strong than it had just minutes before. He snatched up the tiny piece of paper and ran back over to the front of the ship, raising it in front of his face.

Yes, the assortment of grey blobs scribbled across the page laid exactly over the group of clouds they were approaching. It was perfect.

“It’s the same, every time,” Allia said, still staring. For the first time, Billy noticed the stack of cards, identical to his, clutched in her hand.

They flew closer, descending slightly, Billy looking down at the picture every once in a while. The closer they came, the more and more the accuracy of the tiny drawing became clear---including the little spikes at the top, all lined up in front of each other, directly in the centre of the formation. They didn’t look puffy or have that same light heather hue as the wide clouds that now stretched across the entire eastern-to-western front.

Allia kept up her light beam to the sky, and Damian ran up to join the three at the bow of the ship as they descend towards the little spikes.

Well, little in comparison with the cloud structure, which almost stretched across the entire horizon, it’s edges only shielded by the sunlight.

Billy’s jaw dropped, realizing the spikes weren’t just his eyes playing tricks on him. They were rugged rock-faces---of full-sized mountains. He took a terrifying glance down---he couldn’t see an inch of land, just clouds which at this height seemed like fluffy ground. 

And whatever these floating mountains were---they were moving towards them.

“What is that?” Billy shouted at Allia.

“My home,” she replied.

Billy stared back towards the mountains, shivering, though his throbbing heart had already warmed his skin. Even in the obviously amped-up religious tales, Olitheon never did anything like this, lifting a mountain---no, *several* mountains, into the atmosphere.

In a panic, he took of a mitt and threw a bare hand onto his cheek. It was freezing on the surface but burning under his skin. He reached the hand out in front of his face. The wind was blaring now---but there was none.

Billy squinted back at the formation of clouds. The right corner was nearing the edge of his vision, and the left corner was deep in the blinding light, but he kept squinting. The *woosh* of the blowing wind flew by again, it was nothing if not consistent, in the growth of its volume as well.

And right there, before the downbeat of the wind, at the very corner of the row of clouds, he saw it---the tip of a massive wing, bare of feathers. It quickly flowed down back under the smog, followed by that bellowing *woosh.*

Billy collapsed backwards onto the ship’s deck, scrambling away as if he saw a ghost. He pointed his finger off the ship, and Damian turned with wide eyes at the commotion.

“Dam---it’s---the clouds---they---they’re--- *alive*---“

“*Tehwa Kanura*,” Allia said, still holding up the beam of light as they started to fly over the clouds, which became fog on their deck. “Or as you might’ve heard as a disobedient child---one of the *legendary beasts*.”

Damian scuttled to the side, holding the edge of the deck, and Billy tiptoed up next to him. The ship flew past the now larger-than life mountains, which had little crevices cut in and sticking out around the tips. Whatever this beast was, all but these spikes was covered in the bed of clouds. And still, once in a while, the tip of the wing peeked up over the clouds, a massive surface of stretched maroon skin. It made Billy’s stomach sink every time.

Allia let out a throaty sigh, and the ship finally passed the last of the spikes, which was the smallest, barely reaching above the cloud bed. She glanced down, tapping her foot, but still kept the beacon blazed above her head, although it had noticeably dimmed since its inception.

Billy breathed a sigh of relief; although he his feet were hidden under the fog which had taken over their boot, hints of blue sky were appearing again past the front of the ship. Maybe they would pass *whatever* this crazy thing was and then he could bring this girl back down to reason---back down to the ground level.

The ship vibrated. It was subtle, but his shoes shook.

“Hold on to something!” Allia shouted. Billy turned to look at the girl, who had finally released the stupid pillar of light, and was running for the ship’s centre. He yanked Damian back from the edge of the ship, clutching his brother’s hand and following Allia, the deck shaking under his feet more with every step.  The helmsman, still wrapped in the strange see-through tendrils of the bulbous creature that hovered above the ship, held onto another pole nearby, motioning for them to come. Like his gestures would somehow speed them up.

“Grab my hand!” Allia shouted, one hand clutching one of the poles in the middle of the ship, the other stretching toward Billy. The former outlaw held Damian closer, stretching out his arm, preparing to leap and grab Allia’s hand.

A violent yank tugged the entire ship backward.

“No!” Billy screamed, his feet falling only a bit slower than the body of the ship, his fingers growing further away from Allia’s hand. He had chosen a bad time to jump, with Damian clutched to his side.

Like a shot of web, a blue, translucent tendril shot out and whipped around Billy’s arm, tugging him along with the rest of the ship, which was jerked backward, Allia’s hair swinging in the gust.

They soared through the clouds back toward the mountains, so much so that Billy couldn’t see anything. The ship slowed, and Billy finally landed on his feet, although now he wasn’t even able to make out Allia and the helmsman, and only knew Damian was safe because the boy dug his fingers into Billy’s arm. Thankfully, the layer of fog passed over their heads, and things became clear again. 

Then the deck shook again, and a *thunk* came from the bottom of the ship. Billy picked at the slimy tentacle, and it unravelled itself from his arm. Damian released his hands from Billy’s side, brushing away the mop of dark hair. 

Billy looked up. An endless roof of clouds stretched above him, swirling, alive.

“You all right there?” Allia asked, panting.

“Uh, yeah,” Billy said. “You could of warned us, though.”

“You are right, I apologize,” Allia said. “Usually I don’t have people up here at all.”

*Usually?* This kidnapping, flying around in the sky looking for a giant cloud monster was a normal thing for her?

A latch from the deck’s surface popped open, and the horde of sailors started piling out, Benjamin among them. 

Allia and the helmsman exchanged nods. The man closed his eyes, doing some weird gesticulating with his hands, and the slimy tendrils released themselves from the man’s arms as well as from the side of the ship, the same as they had for Billy.  The helmsman smiled, pulling a large biscuit-like foodstuff out of his pocket, and throwing it up into the underside of the bulbous monster, the object disappearing into its gelatinous form.

The crew surrounded the deck, idling, like they were waiting for something. Allia motioned for Billy, Damian, and Benjamin to follow her. Two of the crew members had already set down the gangway.

The ground resembled hard, orange clay, although it was even more solid than that. Looking far past the ship to the base of the now towering mountains, Billy didn’t even want to walk on it. The flapping of the wings was still present, though somehow more distant. This surface---it must’ve been the beast’s back.

“No---“

An older man with a square, greying beard, the speaker, approached alongside a woman with blonde hair that went down to her waist. They both dressed identical; some sort of robe, tied with a knotted belt at the waist, so that the intricate knot faced forward. While the bottom of the cloaks were pure white, hints of green lined the edges. The man wore a black, wide brimmed hat which rose up a good foot or so above his head.

“Chowondo Avador. Chowondo Evelyn,” Allia bowed.

“Allia? It is you, ain’t it?” Allia gave a small nod as the two met eyes. “Let me see it then, you know I need proof.” 

“Of course Chowondo,” Allia bowed her head deeply, before taking the pin out of her hair. She gripped it between her thumb and index and proffered it to the man. He hesitated for a moment, taking a deep inhalation before grabbing it the same way Allia had. The two seemed to tense up for a moment as they both mouthed a phrase in a language Billy couldn’t parse. 

“Ever eventful with you, kid,” the man smiled, handing the pin back to Allia before glancing to Damian, Benjamin, and Billy on the opposite side of the deck. 

“Ah, I didn’t notice! No wonder! Very clever!” Benjamin shouted, pointing to a large, violet crystal on the back of the ship. 

“Oh yes,” Allia said. “Benjamin here is a Transportation Herald as well. I was getting a little worried, actually, holding up the Light for so long. I thought someone would pull us in near the front.”

“Nah, we only dock in the back now. Don’t want anyone to accidentally end up in ol’ Kan’s belly,” the bearded man, Avador, replied.

Damian’s eyes widened. Billy didn’t want to think it about it either.

“Ah, a fellow Transportation Herald,” the girl, Evelyn, smiled at Benjamin. The one difference in her outfit was the colouring; navy blue, with a golden trim along the cuffs and hem of the bottom. The trim matched her hair, contrasting with her hawkish yet quite beautiful face.

“In training,” Benjamin chuckled. 

“New recruits, I assume?” Avador asked. 

“Yes,” Allia replied. “I will take them to see the Dakungs immediately.”

A look of amusement crossed the man, “Right now? Forces gift you kid, the Dakungs might like you, but that don’t\[ 2021-01-17, 8:48 AM

Where is this guy from? I just want to make sure the speech quirks are consistent\] mean they’re just gonna let you have an audience with them immediately.” 

Allia grabbed his arm forcibly and pulled the man in close, “Please. I need them to speak with the Dakungs.” She leaned her head against his shoulder and appeared to mumble another quieter plea. \[ 2021-04-10, 10:12 AM

I’m not sure if this still has merit, dk what they’re saying here\]

The man allowed her to rest her head before slipping his arm deftly away. “We’ll go right now then, and we’ll see what they say. By the Forces, you’re not a little girl anymore, you can’t keep doing this.” 

“Then stop allowing it to work,” she said with a smile. An actual smile. Not the feral, demented one she had given after killing that Devinar, or the sarcastic ones she had given while breaking them out of jail. An actual, genuine smile. 

Avador sighed, but his smile returned and he turned back to Billy, Benjamin, and Damian, bowing his head. “Well, I apologize for all the confusion, Allia and I have a lot to catch up on.” he gestured out to the large stretch of red leading to the rocky mountains in the distance. 

“Welcome to the Tsuman Monastery.”
