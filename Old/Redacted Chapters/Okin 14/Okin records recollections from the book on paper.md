His eyes opened to the captain’s glaring armour. 

The lumbering Devinar stood above Okin, who laid across the ground with a soft pillow underneath his head.

As his vision slowly gained distance, he saw the racks of armour that denoted the storage room, and Gendro leaning against one of them.

“He’s awake, he’s awake,” the Devinar said.

Gendro got up from his casual stance and knelt down next to Okin, inspecting his battered face.

“Okin I’m sorry. I should have been there sooner,” the Rothar said.

“What,” Okin rubbed his cheek, where a fleshy bulge was throbbing. “What happened?”

“That animal attacked you,” Gendro said. “I knocked him out as well, but a bit too late.”

The Devinar shot Gendro a disapproving glance. “Yes, and there was quite the aftermath, but it’s all quelled down now.”

“How long have I been out?” Okin asked, checking the ground around him, and looking underneath the pillow. “And where’s my book?”

“Book? What book?” Gendro asked.

“The book!” Okin shouted. “The book that I was holding when that beast of a man attacked me!”

“I-I didn’t see anything,” Gendro said. 

“Me neither,” the Devinar added.

The High Ather pointed a finger to the Devinar. “I can’t lose it, not now! I didn’t even finish it! That book... It contains an understanding of the Gods that we’ve never had before! It---it will lead to the Truth!”

It was uncustomary for a High Ather to order a Devinar around, but Okin knew that he had the weight of Impalias Trenton’s command behind him. Now was not a time for courtesy and conventions.

“Order your men, whoever took it, I need it! I need that book!” Okin shouted.

The Devinar nodded, and Okin heard the trail fo heavy stomping as he left the room. 

“What book is this, Okin?” Gendro asked. “You’re crazy, but I’ve never seen you so fired up.”

Okin stood up, waving Gendro away. “I cannot explain at this moment. I must focus on remembering everything I read. Get me a pencil, or ink, and some paper, now!”

“I do not know where---“

“I don’t care, Gendro! Look! Find me it! *I need it*!” Okin squeezed his head between his palms as he rattled his brain to recite the lines he read.

Gendro half-wittedly looked around the room, pretending to search for a feather and ink although they both knew it would be unlikely to find any in the armoury.

Hearing heavy bounding from outside, Okin rushed to open the wooden door.

The towering man was panting, his head sweltering like a tomato.

“I shouted at them, and no one spoke up. I searched their beds, and there was nothing,” the Devinar said. “Are you sure you lost it?”

“Yes, by Aredal, I’m sure I lost it!” Okin shouted, blowing steam with every exhale. 

The Devinar looked to him with shocked eyes, and Gendro stopped his faux probing.

Okin collapsed on the floor, his breath stabilizing. 

“I am sorry. I shouldn’t have been so upset and used his name in vain,” Okin said. “I’ve been very stressed out lately; I’ve never had such a difficult test of my Dedication before these past few weeks.”

The Devinar nodded, and Gendro stopped what he was doing, striding over to Okin’s side.

“Please, I need a some ink and paper. Could you please get that for me?”

The armoured man nodded again, and left the room for the second time.

“Y’know Okin, I don’t know exactly what you’re going through, but whatever it is, I do have your back. And it’s not ‘cause it’s my job, ‘cause we both know I don’t really take it that seriously, to your dismay,” the Rothar cracked an impish smile. “But it’s ‘cause I truly believe that you are a good man, Okin. You aren’t perfect, but you try to be the best that you can be with what you got. You’re--- you’re what Athers are supposed to be.”

Okin smiled back softly.

“I’m sorry I was so heated earlier,” Okin said. “I--- I just feel lost, and I finally had a path forward, and then it was instantly snatched away.”

Gendro sat down on the floor next to Okin.

“You will be fine, Okin. There will be hurdles and bumps, but you can always be sure of your Dedication,” he said.

*But I’m not sure if I can. I have still done little to prove that I am Brave or that I stand for Justice,* the Ather thought. 

Okin shook his head wildly, refocusing on what had been within the book. 

*He was talking about making some sort of weapon, or tool, how he had worked with other powerful beings in order to make it... I assumed it was Architor who wrote this?  He was the only one who had such skill in forging, and crafting... but he never mentioned any other God. He said other names a few times, only Olitheon knows what it was now, I didn’t take time to remember! Damn myself, Aredal! Damn me!*

The door slammed open; the Devinar carried a jar of ink and a fine-point feather in one arm and a wad of blank paper in the other.

“Quickly, quickly!” Okin shouted, taking the contents from the Devinar’s arms.

Gendro took a small stool that was next to one of the weapon shelves and pulled it closer to Okin, who kneeled down in front of it, placing the paper on the stool’s topside and blitzing with his pen hand.

*I never knew there were mystical creatures in this world. I thought I had seen all it had to offer. But yet there was something more magical than anything I had ever seen before. But what I have now discovered breaks the laws of the universe,* Okin wrote first.

*That was correct, right?* Okin said, blood filling his brain as he anxiously tried to recall the book’s contents. The swelling continued to pump wilder as he went deeper in thought.

*We found it in the unmarked lands, it was brilliant and unlike any ore or crystal of this world. It was ironic and startling that such a beautiful, unique artifact was in such a twisted, corrupted place,* Okin scribbled down furiously. *Yet there was also immense power there, power of both holiness and death. That was why we built our forge there.* 

Okin racked his head. What was next? He remembered he had re-read the first page several times as he was getting comfortable to the eccentric and out-of-context ramblings of this author, but after that he had begun to read more normally, falsely assuming he’d be able to look over it again as many times as he wanted.
