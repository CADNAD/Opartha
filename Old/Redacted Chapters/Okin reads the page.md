Sweat streamed from Okin’s face. The stench of the street sewers were only masked, or perhaps buffed,  by the stench of the High Ather himself; he hadn’t bathed since his arrival in Metheno, over a week ago. 

He suppressed his steps and his breath, 

His eyes shot open, his heart pumping as if he was a gladiator in the times of the Trentanian Empire fighting for his life in an arena.  He kept re-reading the last few lines of the crumpled sheet which the mysterious beggar had given him.

*I stand here today, not because of choice, but lack thereof. He has left me without option. Only he could pressure me to stand against him, only he knows my personality well enough to force my hand. Only my brother.*

The passage couldn’t have really been written by Nexon. Nexon and his brother, Olitheon, stood as shining examples of the brotherly bond--- the bond which inspired the induction of Rothars around Wreathward. Yes, they were vastly different in personality and temperament, but that was exactly what showcased their unyielding sense of family (maybe replace with power of family).

Okin shook his head. *There is no way that this is not just the writings of some madman. The way that Nexon writes here is radically different from the first three books, the* real *three.*

Still, the false revelations stirred Okin’s conscience. Perhaps he was shaken by what monstrous mind would come up with such blasphemy. 

The Ather checked his peripherals. There was no one else in sight. After re-reading the page once more, Okin folded it up until it was small enough to fit within his palm, and then placed it back in his satchel

*I must see if there is anything that confirms the existence of this Fourth Book in anyway.* There was only one building that contained nearly all the knowledge of The Citadel, unnecessary and niche texts that benefited only the curious minds of scholars and those with the highest Dedication. And luckily, it was right here, in the actual Citadel.

Okin straightened his robes, looking around for the shining armour of any Rothars or Devinars. There were none. He then turned around, running back towards the centre of The Citadel, where the Four statues towered. There was only one place where he could confirm whether this supposed book was real or just the writings of a crazy vagabond.
