“Come on, Billy,” Benjamin said, giving an unimpressed look.

“I know, I know. I got arrested, *yet again*, and you stayed behind and saved me, *yet again*,” Billy sighed. “Thank Benjamin. You really are a good friend, and I appreciate everything that you’ve done,” Billy paused, and he couldn’t help but flash a quick smile at his own half-sarcastic yet somehow genuine thanks. “But---“

“No!” Benjamin stomped. Billy’s shoulders jerked. His friend wasn’t one to raise his voice, and *burn*, he was 

“This not about me, Billy! I have lost nothing! I just did my job, had good drink, had *fun*, and then I can return home with new tools on belt. But---that girl, she lost everything to help us---to help *you*. Without her, you dead. And Damian, too.”

Billy whipped around. “Yes, yes, I admit, she did break us out of prison, but I am not going to kill myself just because I owe her a debt! Going into Krinosas, that’ll just kill her too! If she wants, fine, as much as I hate to do it, she can stay with us in Apathasaw, until she’s got enough paper to go off and do what she wants.”

“That will not help her. I am not dumb, Billy,” Benjamin’s eyes pierced into his. “I know world has been unfair to you and Damian. I know you would not come to  Wreathward unless there something you *needed* do, and I still respect your privacy. Wouldn’t you wanted somebody to\[ This might be a little too roundabout\] have done what was fair for you?”

“No, no. You don’t get it,” Billy shook his head to the floor, sitting down on his bed. “*This---*this is exactly how people die. They think they can go in, and stand up for what they think is right, or whatever, but they don’t know the stakes!” Billy seethed, turning away from his friend. He slammed his hands against his head, forcing away those images again. “Those in charge---the world, for Aredal’s sake, they don’t even want us to *survive*.  You can’t dare stand against them for anything less significant than your life.”

Benjamin sighed, pointing at the closed door that stood between them and the open deck. “When she saved us, she was thinking of more than her life. More than once. Would you really not want to help her to just do this?”

Billy looked down. It was true, even in his mind there was no shred of doubt that this girl, strangely, had done what she had to help them. Sure, she had her sick cult beliefs that Billy still didn’t get, but she had saved their lives. But what would be the use of putting them all at risk again? Just to---pay it forward?\[ 2021-04-29, 9:24 AM

Edit this stuff lol\]

“It---it’s not that I don’t want to,” Billy gave his friend a bitter stare. “It’s that I *can’t*.”

“Well, I think you can now,” Benjamin said, crossing his arms.

Billy stayed silent, resting his chin against arm, which sat on his leg. He glanced back to Benjamin; his massive friend loomed over him, arms crossed.

“Fine. I’m gonna get some more sleep,” he collapsed onto the bed, pulling the blanket over himself.

“Sounds good,” Benjamin said. “Thank you, Billy. I should be getting sleep too. All that training and running around has made me tired.”

The sound of his massive friend plopping down on the far bed shook the room. Billy turned over. His friend had wrapped himself in his jacket, and was already drifting off.
