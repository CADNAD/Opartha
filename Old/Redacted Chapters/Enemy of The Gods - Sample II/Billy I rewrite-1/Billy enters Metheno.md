Billy held Damian by the shirt as they joined the crowded dock. Instinctively, his other hand hovered just above his holster. 

They were louder than him in both dress and voice, but Billy still stuck out like a whore at a ballroom gala. There were only men of two outfits, but both were radically different then his ripped chaps, brown leather and up-curved cowboy hat. 

There were men dressed in bold white leggings and undershirts, some of who spouted modest navy jackets. They walked in straight, determined lines and carried large cargo boxes, though somehow their white outfits had no stains. Though the sailors were performing duties, they still gave Billy a questioning eye. 

But it was the aristocrats who made Billy’s blood boil, and he had been waiting for them with equal resentment. They were likely either boarding passenger ships or checking on labourers, both activities which promoted ample ogling. They at Billy like he was not a man, but rather a giant bird; some fear, some disgust, some shock.

Billy pulled Damian in closer. With his simple, dirtied, cloth shirt, Damian appeared less foreign than Billy, but they still looked *down* upon him. 

Damian didn’t seem to notice, though, and that gleeful look on his face would only disappear when Billy tugged him back if he got to close to a worker or horse.

“I don’t---,” Damian pointed as they stepped down the dock’s rails onto a paved road. “Those houses, they weren’t there before! And never were there any so colourful.”

Billy grunted. The houses were taller than they were wide, which was quite unusual. They also had these bright pastel colours painted onto the concrete walls, which really jabbed right at your eye.

“Keep it down. We already stick out enough. We aren’t here to look at the scenery, and we aren’t here to meet new people, or any old ones, either,” Billy narrowed his eyes at Damian.

Damian’s bright eyes faded, and he nodded. Billy pulled him along into the town.

They streets were bustling, and even though he didn’t care, Billy did notice that they had fancied-up the road to the docks with sturdy yet artistic rock patterns to match the new development extending towards the docks.

Though he glanced around, Damian listened to Billy and kept his hair over his face and a hunched posture as to not draw attention. Billy used the tip of his hat to shield his face; he stuck out, but he could always lose the hat and jacket for a bit as long as they didn’t notice his features.

On the opposite side of the road, a short man with a black moustache and matching receding hairline lent out of a carriage that seemed to be made of gold and silver. Billy knew it was almost definitely painted, but it still carried the embossments that looked like golden vines wrapped around the spotless silver body. Even the harnesses which attached to the two Trentanian stallions in front had unnecessary golden clips and buckles. 

And the man had the air of his carriage, too; though unlike the other noblemen Billy had had the displeasure of making eye contact with since his arrival, there was a look of *amusement* on the man’s wide face--- though his symmetrical wave-like moustache hid his mouth, its black hairs tipped up equally on either side at once upon seeing Billy. His eyebrows and cheeks perked up, and he leaned in to the carriage and seemed to have a chuckle with someone next to him. 

Billy’s jaw tensed, and he let out a fiery exhale. He swore he could *hear* that man’s raised, pompous laugh, though it was covered by the sound of stomping hooves and He knew he should look away, play it safe, and cover his tracks, but he couldn’t help but glower at him from underneath the brim of his hat. He didn’t *force* it to happen, but Time slowed, just as the little man pointed a stout finger directly at him. In the carriage, a large bob of red curly hair and prim painted lips leaned over next to the short man, and the woman also grew a look of haughty amusement. 

Billy observed every minuscule expression 0n the couple’s face as they jeered at him. Each *ha* became a chant of war surrounding him, and their clean fingers jabbed at him like spears. 

Saliva gathered in the recesses of his cheeks. He lifted his chin, his eyes narrowed, and he popped a little smirk, before--- 

“Hey,” Damian’s voice made him jerk away from the stranger. Billy swallowed his spit. The silver carriage rolled right past them, and Billy didn’t hear another sound beside hoofs and wheels on the pavement.

“Look at that,” Damian pointed at a marble statue of a tall man holding a book. But the statue wasn’t so much holding it in the traditional sense, rather, it looked as though a  book was hovering just under his eye level. His arms were raised up, as if he was speaking to a crowd, but his hands did not touch the book, rather, the book hovered in between his hands.

“I don’t remember us having a statue of Revictus in town square. Come to think of it, we probably always should’ve had one, as he was supposedly born here, and it’s kind of... our town’s thing, y’know. Or, whatever *here* was a thousand two-hundred years ago, I mean,” Damian said.

Billy bit his lip. He didn’t know why Damian was insisting on calling Metheno “our town”, when it hadn’t been for so many years. Maybe it was because it they actually stayed *here* when they were here, instead of always being on the move like they’d been in Apathasaw.

“And--- wait--- how is it doing that?” Damian’s eyes were glued to the statue now, not giving one iota to what might’ve been taking place around him. 

Even Billy was curious. It didn’t *look* like the book or the hands of the statue were made out of Space Crystal; it all appeared to be a homogenous marble, and anyway, Billy didn’t think that Space Crystal could even do such a thing without a Herald’s control. His curiosity spiked, and he followed Damian towards the statue.

Lined around the statues were a three benches that formed a triangle with open corners. An elderly man sat on the closest bench, and smiled as Damian approached.

Damian didn’t make eye contact with the man, and instead leaned his head over to see underneath the arms of the statue.

“Ah,” Damian gave a satisfied look. He turned around to Billy. 

“It’s just a few *super* thin rods of reinforced glass with steel fixtures at the ends protruding out from the statue’s chest and forearms at angles where the book and its arm’s block it from the front and side,” Damian said. “The book is probably close to hollow, too, or just painted with a coating that appears like marble.”

Damian continued to observe the curves of the statue, which floated down in a billowing cloak of sorts.

“It is quite fitting, really,” the elderly man who was a sitting just next to where Damian now stood perked up. Damian looked down, and the man gave a kind smile. “Using what appears like magic, but in reality it is just technology garnered by Knowledge, and as you step in closer, it reveals itself. Just as Revictus revealed Knowledge to us.”

“Or maybe it shows that everything is a fraud if you really get a good look,” Billy stepped in between the old man and Damian.

The elderly man chuckled. “This has been here a while, though I enjoy it almost every day. It is safe to assume you are tourists, and not just spouting the Apathasawian style for a day?”

“Well, yes. But I apologize, sir,” Billy said. “As I told my... *partner*, unfortunately we’re on a tight schedule, and we’ve got to be going.”

“Oh,” the elderly man said. “I understand. You Apathasawians--- busy folk, from what I hear.”

Billy gave a fake smile and a nod. He grabbed Damian by the shoulder, and pulled him a long, though the boy kept glancing back at it was Billy led him out of the town square.

“Hey, I told you we aren’t here to make friends,” Billy said.

“He was the one that started talking to me,” Damian replied. “I just wanted to get a good look at the statue.”

“Well we *certainly* aren’t here to ogle at men,” Billy said with a wagging finger. 

Damian giggled, and Billy couldn’t help but crack a smile at his own jest. Maybe there would be joy on this journey to come.
