Liu’s eyes had to adjust to the now blinding light of the outdoors. Since the beginning of the round, the clouds had now cleared, making way for the harsh Delmian summer sun. 

It means that the troops will take more damage automatically now. Perhaps a Shadowmaker will be useful. 

The young Delmian kept transitioning from a jog to a slow walk; he was frantic to get to the next tent to minimize the time in which he was exposed, but part of him wanted to make sure the Coinmoles also had a guard in the Ravhound.

So he finally decided on a slower pace, placing both hands in a bridge over his eyebrows so he could get a clear view of the centre field away from the sun’s glare.

Thankfully, the three units which he had sent out just before his big move were still alive; The Shield-Man stood just at the centre of the battlefield, with the Sniper Snake slithering behind, and the parrot fluttering above the two.

Just past the three, Liu saw another group of units approaching--- Jin’s. There was a Shield-Men in front, followed by three Spear-Men. Based on the performance of the Spear-Men during Hao and Khan’s game, and their low cost, Liu thought his two attacking troops would easily hold their own. Plus, he could always send out his Ravhound. 

The parrot would be nice to have at my side. He responded to the other’s names, he should respond to his own.

Liu moved his cupped hands off of his forehead and down around his lips. “Parrot! Follow me!” He shouted as loud as he could.

The parrot twirled in the air, flying towards Liu. 

Liu brought his hands back over his eyeline to get a clear view of the battlefield. Most importantly, he kept a consistent speedwalk towards the nearest tent, which was approximately sixty yards from the centre of the field, to Liu’s left. Past that, he saw two other tents--- one was nearly directly in the also to the left, and the other was much closer to Jin’s tent, on the right. Liu continued his march, with the Dark Herald, his Ravhound and Coinmoles in tow, eyeing the battlefield. His parrot had now also re-joined the group, and he reached out an arm for it to perch on. 

The parrot happily accepted its seat, and Liu looked to it, but decided not to give it a command just yet. Strangely, the violet mist which surrounded the parrot, as it did all the summons, was flowing off of it more, as if it was releasing it. Equally by odd was the fact that the parrot seemed almost transparent--- although it was hard to tell because of its bright green colour.

Liu turned his attention away from his parrot and back towards the battlefield. Both Liu and Jin’s contesting troops were now all between the centre tent and Jin’s secondary tent, with the Sniper Snake just past the approximate center line. Both Shield-Men continued to advance forward as the Sniper Snake lifted its head off the floor, into its offensive stance.

The Sniper Snake fired its signature blast towards the group of enemy soldiers, and it hit--- squat in the centre of the barrier of the Shield-Man, who moved forward undamaged.

The other Shield-Man was moving forward in the battle, the two opposing guards on a collision course. It seemed as if the two Shield-Men would collide, until out from behind the squad of Spear-Men, a new foe leaped.

And leap it did. The frog vaulted over the group ‘men,' doing a strange mid-air spin so its backside was now facing the opposing troops. Liu wasn’t sure if it was purposeful or a mishap. 

Another shot of venom barrelled through the air from the Sniper Snake--- once again hitting the Shield-Man, doing nothing. The usual powerful ranged attacker was seeming quite useless in this situation.

They aren’t intelligent enough to know when their attacks are futile. Perhaps I could direct them not to attack Shield-Men in the future?

And intentional or not, the frog’s aerial swivel allowed it to immediately fire a cone of spit at the exposed backside of Liu’s Shield-Men, who dissolved at the attack. 

My remaining troops are slow, and the Sniper Snake looks like it could lose against the Frog. Though the Frog hops through the air, it also seems to move forward quite slowly.

“Ravound, attack the enemy Frog, and then the enemy Spear-Men, and then return,” Liu shouted.

The dog-like creature shot forward, sprinting in a straight line at the enemy troops.

The frog turned around, and was now approaching the Sniper Snake, the small horde of Spear-Men following its lead. The serpent had stayed a good twenty yards behind its former defender, and the frog leaped through the air in a lob-like arc, covering around ten yards with each jump, each jump requiring a ‘build-up’ of a few seconds, and a few seconds in the air. 

The Ravhound, however, covered almost fifteen yards a second. 

The Frog began its leap as the Sniper Snake charged up another shot, still aiming at the nearest target, which was now the Frog. After reaching the apex of its leap, another line of fire came from the Sniper Snake--- this time, it actually missed its target, the straight line of venom flying just over the head of the falling Frog.

Perhaps they aren’t intelligent enough to account for gravity. Then again, even a veteran musketeer would have a hard time making that shot, Liu thought. 

The Frog landed with grace, loading up its hind legs to begin its second leap towards the Sniper Snake--- which by Liu’s estimation, would place it just in the right range to attack.

But just as the frog’s webbed foot left the ground, it was tackled by the charging Ravhound, who took it down mid-air, mouth first. Liu saw the Frog’s body disappear inside the jaws of the Ravhound.

The Ravhound then turned its attention towards the lone Shield-Men and the hanging Spear-Men. 

By now, Liu and his crew were already nearing the tent. Liu slowed his pace, standing just outside the entrance of the tent, still focused on the battlefield. The dark-robed man and the Coinmoles waited patiently behind. 

The Ravhound flew at the guarding Shield-Man, the pure velocity of his leap pinning the Shield-Man to the ground. The Shield-Man lay with his back to the ground and shield to the sky, the wild hound violently attacking on top of him; the Ravhound reached in with claws and teeth, desperately trying to get around the shield.

The Spear-Men quickly swarmed the Ravhound, but one fell to a shot by the ever-present Sniper Snake.  The Ravhound took some hits to the back from the Spear-Men’s weapons, eventually letting out a whine as it dissolved into nothingness, but not before the pinned Shield-Man was hit by fatal shot from the Sniper Snake, its feet and legs exposed from the Ravhound’s attack.

So those two are an effective combo against Shield-Men. An extremely overpriced combo, but a combo nonetheless.

The remaining Spear-Men trudged toward the Sniper Snake, and Liu knew his ranged attacker would easily win that matchup, so he finally went through the large hole in the tent.

The tent was a fair bit smaller than the original base, and like before, the ground was dirt. The moles followed behind the Dark Herald, who entered behind Liu.

“Get them to sniff for gold,” Liu said to the dark-robed man, who held out a golden coin to each of the moles. The moles sniffed, and began digging once again at the new site.

“Parrot,” Liu turned to the green bird, who was still perched on his arm. “Go scan the battlefield, and record all units, both ours and the enemy’s, then return to me.”

The parrot cocked its head, and then responded, “Yes master,” before flying out of the tent.

I should be winning, based on the little bit of the battle I saw. But is Jin already at his second tent, or just mining silvers? Jin had almost definitely bought three Coinmoles, so if he did move, it was probably before Liu had stepped out into the battlefield. Liu may have been behind in resources, but Jin didn’t seem to have too many troops on the battlefield, and it looked like Liu was just up a Sniper Snake. 

I should take advantage of this as soon as possible. Jin’s main camp is still defended by a Domesnapper, same as mine, but if he has moved up, he’ll be more vulnerable. And why wouldn’t he have moved up, having three moles on gold gives a huge economic advantage. But then again... maybe I should wait until my parrot comes back, just to be sure. I wouldn’t want to send a Ravhound into a Domesnapper.

Liu stood inside the dark tent, thinking of tactics and deciphering his opponent’s strategy as he waited for his parrot to return. 

A mole returned from the depths with a shiny gold coin, interrupting Liu’s thoughts. It had been quite a few minutes, and Liu’s parrot had oddly not returned. Perhaps Jin had summoned new units, and the parrot was still collecting data.

“You have six credits,” Liu’s Dark Herald told him.

I want to summon a Ravhound, but I should wait for my parrot to return, and maybe for the second Coinmole to pop up. Then, I can choose between two Ravhounds or maybe a Bullhog and a Domesnapper to defend my tent, and destroy Jin’s Domesnapper. That way I won’t have to worry about Jin having defence or incoming attacks.

So Liu waited for a couple more minutes, but the strange delay of his parrot was starting to worry him. Soon enough, the second mole returned with a golden coin in its mouth.

Where is that parrot?

Liu started to sweat; without his parrot, he felt blind. 

“You have eleven credits.”

Okay, I should probably buy a Domesnapper now. I don’t know where my parrot went, so I won’t know if Jin’s launching an attack against this tent. I need some security.

“I’ll buy a Domesnapper,” Liu said.

The summoner nodded, and brought to life another one of the wide-jawed turtles.

And I might as well go with the original plan of attacking him with a Bullhog. There’s no way he can defend against---

Liu’s thoughts were interrupted by a loud snap, which came from the fingers of his Dark Herald. He saw both the Coinmole and the Domesnapper disappear at his feet.

The Dark Herald breathed a sigh. “I’m sorry, you lose.”

Liu’s eyes widened, as his mind raced with thoughts.

“How- how did I lose?” 

The dark-robed man closed his eyes, touching his right hand to his temple. After a few seconds of silence, he responded.

“The opponent defeated your Domesnapper with a Drophawk, and then a Ravhound took the chalk.”

Liu’s eyes opened in realization. 

I took too long to decide. I waited passively, while I left two chokepoints open to attack.

“And where was my parrot? Why did he take so long to return?” Liu asked.

Eyes closed again. More time in deep thought.

“Your parrot was chased by several enemy Leechcrows, and defeated.”

Ah, so Jin must’ve used Leechcrows to both distract my Sniper Snake, and hunt down my parrot.

The dark-robed man opened his eyes again. “Overall, it was a very good game, especially for two beginners.”

Liu looked down to his feet, where the Domesnapper was just seconds ago. 

*No, not a good game.*
