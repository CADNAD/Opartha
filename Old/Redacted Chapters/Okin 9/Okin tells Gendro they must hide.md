Okin sat on the bed, his leg shook the frame with its rapid tapping. His brain ached--- was it because of the minimal hours of sleep he had gotten over the past few days, or just dehydration? His mind drifted back to his decision to Aldwin, and his decision to stay here in The Citadel. *You may stay here in The Citadel with your Rothar for two nights, but after that, you are too return straight back to Arisk*a. Aldwin’s words echoed in Okin’s mind. The Impalias wasn’t one who spoke lightly. Okin would have to continue sneaking around with upmost caution, especially as this mystery didn’t seem to have a simple solution. He should have ample grace time---it would take more than a week for Aldwin’s letter to reach Ariska, and Ariska would have to send one back to report Okin’s absence.

*Aldwin wouldn’t wait for that, though. He’d send Rothars down here to make sure I’m gone, then send the letter to make sure I wasn’t just hiding out somewhere else in The Citadel. I will have a few weeks of safety from Aldwin’s reach--- but I have to get out of here first.*

Okin gathered his spare robes, his coin pouch, and the book which he had checked out from the library. The Ather made the bed before leaving the room---the Istars shouldn’t have to do extra work just because he was in a tight spot. Tiptoeing out of the hall, he moved to the next room, where Gendro slept. Okin hadn’t spoke to the Rothar in two days--- between chatting with mysterious beggars, watching horrifying executions, and blazing through books for information about the times of the Gods, Okin hadn’t had the opportunity nor the need to speak with his Rothar. And Gendro would never do anything unless explicitly commanded.

Okin knocked on the door with apprehension. He had to be loud enough to wake the sleeping Rothar, yet quiet enough that no one else awoke from the sound. No luck.

*Any louder and I might be heard.* 

The rooms didn’t have locks, but it was assumed that no Athers, Rothars, or Istars would disrespect the privacy of another clergyman. Usually, Okin would *never* cross etiquette like this, but this situation was an exception, and well, Gendro was also an exception.

The Rothar had left the curtains open, but it was still before dawn so no light had spilled in. On the windowsill sat an opaque white crystal, and his clothes, travelling bags, and armour were all spilled out across the floor in a chaotic mess.  Gendro himself was scrambled across the bed, snoring with his mouth wide open. Okin shook him until he snapped awake.

“O-Okin?” Gendro said. “Okin what are you doing? What time is it?”

“Gendro, we have to go. Aldwin will send troops to check on us to make sure we aren’t still in the city. They could be here by morning, or afternoon, but I can’t be sure. We have to make sure it looks like that we already left, and find a new place to stay.”

Gendro rubbed his eyes, yawning. “Wait, what? Why-why would Aldwin want us out of the city so bad?”

“I don’t know why!” Okin quietly exclaimed. “Whatever the reason, we have to make sure he never finds us.”

“Wait a second. Why don’t we just leave and go back to Ariska?” Gendro asked.

Okin buried his face in his hands as he realized his blunder. He could have just left without saying a word, hidden himself somewhere in the city, and Aldwin would’ve found Gendro alone, and clueless. Sure, he would’ve probably known that Okin was somewhere in the city, but The Citadel was huge; Okin would have some time. Now, Okin had to convince the laziest Rothar in the world to do extra work for the greater good. The exhaustion had destroyed his decision-making skills, and now he was in a tough spot.

“We... I discovered something, Gendro, something which might change everything that I thought I knew. I can’t explain it now, but I have to stay here. I can’t just go back to Ariska, go back to preaching and delivering sermons knowing that I might’ve been missing part of the message, that a injustice from my past might not be rectified. Please Gendro, I need to do this, and for that I need you to cooperate.”

Gendro stayed silent for a bit, and then burst out laughing. “Why so dramatic all of a sudden? Isn’t it my job to cooperate with you?”

Okin smiled. “Well, we both know you haven’t exactly done a *great* job of cooperating. At least not without resistance.”

Gendro’s lips pursed. “What are you talking about? I am the greatest, most Dedicated Rothar there ever was.”

The two men laughed in synchrony.

Okin straightened his face. “But Gendro, I am being serious. We will have to hide, and from some who are our superiors.  We will have to be *careful.* This *is* serious.”

Gendro’s smile faded, and his gaze departed from Okin’s. 

“I understand.”

The two men shielded their faces and walked with with crouched postures in between the crowds of busy hustlers. It was early in the morning, but sellers were competing for the best spots, and customers were looking to snatch the limited items. A Rothar and an Ather wouldn’t be even remotely suspicious in The Citadel, but Okin could never be too careful; any Rothar or Ather could be a contact of Aldwin. So he stayed hidden among the crowds, and made sure his face was always inconspicuous.

“Where are we even going?” Gendro asked, catching up to Okin.

“To be honest,” Okin said, continuing his speed-walk. “I do not know.”

Gendro stopped in his tracks, and Okin was forced to turn around. 

“What are you doing, c’mon!” The Ather shouted.

“You do not even know where we are going! I knew you were stubborn, but I thought at least you were a planner.”

Okin stormed over to Gendro, grabbing him by the arm. The Rothar stood his ground, unmoved.

“Okin, I will follow you, but not until you tell me where we are going, and what we are going to do.”

Okin’s eyes narrowed, glaring at the rebellious Rothar, whose stare did not waver.

*I do not know, Gendro! I would tell you if I knew!* Okin didn’t know of any safe places in The Citadel; he had only been here once before, and for the brief time of two days. He was unsure of the full extent of Aldwin’s reach, but it seemed more likely that it was extensive, and Aldwin definitely knew the walled city better than he did. Perhaps this was hopeless, perhaps there really was nowhere to hide. And Gendro was right: just rushing without knowing was by far the worst option.

*But I cannot go home.* 

A line from within the Versalist Bible came to his head, a line spoken by his God. *You cannot rely on others to stand for truth and justice.* 

And at that moment, Okin’s stare was pulled away from Gendro and caught by the blinding light which shone at the centre of the city: the statue of his God, Aredal.

And another passage from the Book of Values popped into his head.

*Do not hide yourself, for you are either trying to fool your own mind or merely delay the inevitable. Take action, and only present the truth.*

Okin looked back to Gendro, and his eyes lit up.

“Come, we must meet with the Impaliases.”

“You just told me that we have to avoid Aldwin at all costs!” Gendro shouted.

“Not Aldwin,” Okin replied.

Okin stormed up to the entrance of The Cathedral ere Aredal, his Rothar in tow. As usual, a row of Devinars guarded the entrance, holding spears. The same one that had led Okin to Aldwin’s manor just two days earlier marched up, stopping Okin in his path.

“Greetings, High Ather. You wish to enter The Cathedral?”  The Devinar asked.

“I need to speak to Impalias Trenton,” Okin said.

“Impalias Trenton is in a meeting. You will have to wait,” the Devinar replied.

*At least he’s here.* Normally, the Impaliases would be delegated to their region, but it seemed as if they had all been summoned to The Citadel. It likely had something to do with the upcoming election.

“How long will it likely be?” Okin asked.

“I do not know. These meetings can last from less than an hour to over six,” the Devinar replied. “If you wish, I can deliver a message.”

Okin thought for a bit, and then nodded. “Tell the Impalias that I have very crucial news regarding the upcoming election.” 

The Devinar nodded, and ordered his brothers-in-arms to stand guard as he entered the Cathedral.
