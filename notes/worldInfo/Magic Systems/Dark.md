Mind control can control nervous system  k
School of Creation:

Powers:

Heralds can create summons and store them in the dark dimension. They can summon these at any time. Some summons can retain memory, but all retain memory of the original function.

Limits:

\-Creating summons with higher brain function sacrifices the user’s consciousness

\-Summons slowly burn away in the light, the rate increases the brighter the light is. Summons must be ‘healed’ by a dark herald, but this can only be done in darkness.

\-Man summons must be actively commanded by the herald.
