# Chapter One
"No nightmares, right?" 
The disheveled, rough man with the gaunt face said before leaning back against the wall with a bottle of rum.
The equally thin teenager shook his head, a dark floof of hair over his eyes.
"Good", the disheveled man smiled with soot-filled teeth. "And work's still good?"
The thin teenager paused. Then an uncaring shrug.
"I finally got a musket to hide underneath that loose plank against the wall with that painting over it. It's gonna get busier this time of year. Now there's a way for you to defend yourself safely no matter what you're up against," the man said in his usual scratchy rasp.
"I-I really don't think it's gonna get that much busier. Mister G hardly has any customers. Just some old guys. And, I don't even know if they're customers... they don't seem to buy anything," the boy replied with a voice like what a kitten would have if they could talk.
The man scratched his chin. "Hm. It must get busier in this season. How else does he make his money?"
The teenager shrugged again.
"Maybe he's the one we need to look out for. Damn it. I hate I have to leave you alone here, Damin," the man scrunched his lips. "Is there any way we can get into those private rooms of his?"
"Maybe we shouldn't. I mean we've been here a month, and his price is fair. He probably wouldn't like us snooping around. After all we've--" Damin replied.
"I know, I know," the man said. "It's just-- if he does anything-- anything weird at all--"
"I'll tell you, Billy," Damin said nonchalantly.
Billy sighed as he looked around the completely wooden room, lit only by a dim candle light. Damin kept staring at Billy with his hands lazily crossed in between his legs.
"I've decided," Billy paced around the room, clinking the bottom of the bottle with his fingers as the teenagers' eyes followed him. "I'm gonna take the duel."
For the first time, Damin sprung awake. "No no no no. Why would you do that? We're finally safe again!"
"I know," Billy said. "But I also know I can win. And it's a lot of money."
"You don't care about money. If you cared about money, we would've found another circus, or joined a gang. You care about us being safe. About us staying alive!" Damin looked up to Billy.
"It's enough for *that*," Billy said.
"Billy," Damin sighed, burying his face in his ragged leather shirt. "*That's* a pipe dream. It's in *a month.* And we've got nothing."
Billy pointed at Damin. "Exactly! We've been *fucked* every time, and finally something just lands in front of us. It's *exactly* enough money for food, supplies, and two trips for two people. I asked Benjy. And I can *win*."
"How do you know that?" Damin shook his head. "And how do you even know Parsmo'll pick you?"
"Cause I'm a Herald? And the best shot in the city, by far?" Billy raised his hands, like it was a truism.
"Parsmo doesn't know that. Parsmo didn't see you at the circus," Damin retorted.
"Parsmo's shrewd. He's having tryouts just before the duel, and I'll win," Billy said.
"Callaghan's more shrewd," Damin said. "How do you know you're not going up against the best Subject Herald in the state?"
Billy bit his lip. "I'll dodge if it looks like he drew first."
"And what if you screw up?" Damin challenged Billy with his quiet voice.
"I-I'll negotiate with Parsmo to pay a doctor if I get injured, whether I lose or win. And guarantee payment--"
"Yeah right. He's the boss, not you. He'll take someone else. And even if he doesn't, so what? I'll have enough money to bury my brother?" Damin's eyes watered.
Billy looked down, crushed. "I'm sorry. You're right." The disheveled man scrunched his fist and slumped against the wall. 
"I just want to see him. I said five... and now it's ten..." Billy's hands shook in rage.
"I know," Damin leaned forward.
"FUCK!" Billy spinned around smashed the bottle of whiskey against the floor. Damin jumped back onto the bed and shielded his eyes. 
"Sorry", Billy sighed. "Sorry Damin."
Damin took a few deep breathes, and sat back down against the bed.
"Get some sleep, I'll clean it up," Billy said.
Damin tucked into bed, and Billy pulled the blankets over the teenager. Billy got on his knees and picked up the shards of glass one by one.


Light peered in through the window. Damin rubbed his eyes with a yawn. He turned at the glurgle of drinking, and his eyes widened as he saw Billy on the floor, with a new bottle of whiskey in his hand, chugging.
"Billy? Shouldn't you be at work?" A pile of shards lay next to the man.
"I'm not going in this week. That's probably two weeks of pay off, but whatever. Not like there's anything to save for anyway."
"Billy", Damin shook his head and got out of bed. "What if they let you go?"
"They won't," Billy took a large gulp.
Damin sighed. "Well it's too late now anyway, the state you're in." Damian got out of bed.
"This is... this isn't gonna keep happening, right?" The boy's voice was shaky.
Billy just shrugged.
Damin sighed. He moved to leave the room, but stopped in his tracks as his hand met the plank wood door.
"Tell you what, Billy." Damin crouched down and lowered his voice to a whisper. "If you stop drinking. Sober up, and go back to work tomorrow, and for the rest of the week-- I'll try to find a way to snoop around upstairs. See if Mr G has any money, or anything valuable we could sell."
"Shrewd thinking, Damin. But like you said, it's a *pipe dream*", Billy took another chug.
"Just stop, Billy. Put down the bottle, and think with your head-- please."
Billy took pause. "Well, you said there's little customers, but the guy seems oddly relaxed. And I don't see him going off to any farm, but he manages to keep us fed. And there's no way he can sustain this just from my rent alone. This guy's definitely got some nest egg somewhere-- and probably something pretty decent."
Damin looked down, his eyes pained, but he nodded. "See. So it's a deal."
Billy glanced at the bottle, then set it down. He threw the cap back on.
Damin gave a tense smile and pushed the door open.
Billy raised an arm. "Wait." He motioned for Damin to close the door again, and Damin turned back to Billy.
"Let me sober up a little. If anything happens, it's you and me against him." 
Damin looked down at his feet, then sighed. 
"Okay, Billy." 


*Knock, knock.*
Damin waited at the worn but sturdy wooden door. He paused for a few seconds. A low, constant whir came from behind. Damin turned his ear in.
He knocked again, louder this time.
The whirring stopped. Then footsteps approached.
Several clicks came from a large bronze contraption entrenched in the door -- an unfamiliar lock mechanism to Damian. The door creaked open and a short sharp strand of white hair, like the tail of a dog, peeked through before it opened up to the beard of a short, elderly man, who smiled, eye-to-eye with the teenage Damin.
"Hello Damin, customer need me?"
"O-oh no, Mister G," Damin gave a fake smile back. "I've worked here a month... and I'm just curious what you-- what you do in there all day? I don't mean to--"
Mister G gave a hearty laugh.
"Oh Damin, I'd thought you'd never ask. The last fellow was just content to do nothing all day. But you're a boy! And boys are still curious," Mister G widened the gap between the door just enough that Damin could squeeze through, but when he peered behind he saw the man was surrounded by hanging curtains, blocking the view of the room behind.
"And I'd like to think that I never stopped being a boy, in that way. And... after all this time... ALL this time... I'd like to know maybe I helped another boy never stopping being a boy... in that way."
Damin scrunched back a bit.
"But-- if there's too many boys like us... things get a little bit mad. So, you have to promise that you won't whisper to any of your friends?"
"I--", Damian looked down. "I don't really have any friends."
"Oh," Mister G's playful smile dissappeared into a small-lipped flat. "Well then, I guess that solves that."
His smile returned. "Well come on, then!"
Mister G ushered Damin inside. With a heave he shut the door, Damin could see that it was extremely thick, and only the outer panels were made of wood, the inside being made of some hardy steel and bronze. Mister G pulled a lever, and inside the door the same clicking commenced, locking it.
"I've never seen a lock like that--" Damian started.
Mister G laughed, then simply raised the curtain, Damin ducked under to sound of *clicking* and *whirring*--
Damin's jaw dropped.
Every square inch of the room-- even the ceiling-- was covered by something that belonged in a museum-- something totally foreign to Damin's eyes. He quickly scanned, locked in on something, then scanned again. 
"W-wow... I--"
A long bench lined each wall, filled with little contraptions, loose mechanical parts, jars containing strange plants floating in water. At the end of one was a large glass tank, filled with several illustrous fish and exotic sea life. The strange plants popped with both color and motion that threw Damian back; it was alien. He took a step forward--
"Oh, sorry my boy," Mister G said. "Would you mind taking off your shoes?"
Damin looked down at his feet-- the floor was one giant papyrus, covered with strange drawings, blueprints, and calculations. He paused for a few seconds-- but it was entirely symbolic, another language to him, though some shapes looked intuitive. He slipped off his sandals, and then glanced around the room-- there were blueprints, and large landscape paintings, lining every single wall, some even stacked ontop of each other, which he did not notice till now.
"Mister G... you're a-- you're a... genius!" Damian shouted.
Mister G chuckled. "Oh no, oh no. I just have a lot of time on my hands, that's all."
Damian looked at the man, who gave a wrinkly smile. Damin shook his head.
"Well most old men... just get drunk or sit on their porches all day," Damin said. "No offense, Mister--"
"Well of course I do that too, boy!" 
"Well then you're definitely a genius. But-- with all these inventions--" Damin strut around. He peered down at an ever-so complex looking device with lots of pedals that connected to levers, which was covered with paper at the top. "Why do you only sell nails, and-- no offense, plain ol' tools?"
Mister G chuckled. "Oh... this is all just a madman's playhouse. Those tools you sell-- they're good for people, useful." His voice trailed off a bit.
"Yeah and these are--," Damin scrunched his eyes as he moved onto a strange box with weird symbols on it and more gears within then he could count.
"If I sold it to people, I'd lose money with the amount of print that would have to along to tell them how to use it," Mister G said. "And... on the off chance people did find an interest... well I'm not prepared to handle Herald thiefs trying to get in here."
Damian clenched his throat.
"That light confuses the Light Heralds though, in case any of them try to get a peek in here, and tell their friends." Mister G said. "Makes it look like one big empty room."
Damin squirmed as he kept looking around at all the items. Even if there was a safe in here, he'd have more trouble figuring out what it looked like.
Damin turned to Mister G.
"Okay, but surely, even if it's just one thing, you should be able to sell something better than we sell right now!" Damin said.
"I'm not a salesman, Damin. That's why I have good lads like you work the shop," Mister G smiled.
"These new items will sell themselves. Here, this one. Even I can tell-- it heats up things." Damin zoned in on a small steel-box looking device which had some black liquid inside that was steaming. "And it looks pretty simple to use to. Even if you don't want to sell it-- one of those industry guys would pay-- us-- real good."
Mister G shook his head. "It's my contraptions. And I say no. Now please, if you're only interested in selling it, I rather you leave and forget about this."
Damin clenched his lips. "No, it's your stuff. I'm sorry."
Damin's eyes glanced around. His eyebrows raised when he met a strange silver-coated small gun at the end of the table. He approached it.
It was like no gun he'd ever seen before, not anything like Billy's guns, even the dueling pistols he used in the circus. For one-- it was much more elegant but without trying as hard. And it was smaller, even then the dueling pistols. Damin was almost unsure of whether it was a gun it was so small, but it had to be-- it had an obvious handle, and a barrel, and a trigger.
"What's this?" Damin asked.
"Oh," Mister G smiled and picked up the gun. Then, he took his hand and spun a small cylinder in the centre of the gun, much to Damian's surprise. He mimed out a couple shots, and then smiled.
"It does shoot. Unfortunately, you're going to have to take my word for it, as I don't really want to break anything in here, or get noise complaints," Mister G chuckled.
"But what could it shoot that's so small?" Damin asked. "And uh, how do you load it?"
Mister G smiled, and popped open the cylinder in the center, much to Damian's surprise. He flipped over the gun so Damin could see there were 6 small holes in the cylinder.
Damin raised an eyebrow. "Where do you get ammunition that small?"
"I make it of course," Mister G walked over and patted a large, complex rectangular machine next to the wall, and patted it. "Only got about a hundred," he grabbed some bullets out of a large black cloth bag on the table and showed Damin.
"Here try! Just don't shoot!" Mister G handed Damin six bullets and then the gun in one hand.
Damin took the bullets and gun with a shaky hand. He gripped it, then nodded as he got a feel for the craftsmanship.
"So uh... being so small... does it shoot as good as a regular musket?" Damin asked as he popped open the cylinder.
"Oh no, it's more powerful. And such small, nicely shaped bullets--"
"Fire much faster than a musket ball." Damian and Mister G said in unison.
Mister G laughed. "You got it, lad!"
"And uh... what are you calling it?" Damin asked as he slid in each bullet one by one.
"Oh. To be honest, I don't really come up with names. Well-- it shoots six... I guess it's the six shot!" 
Damin nodded slowly. He aimed it at the corner of the room.
"Hm. Six-shot."
"Yes," Mister G nodded. "I think the muskets are rather... slow, and wasteful."
Damin nodded. A few seconds of awkward silence passed.
"And do you... do you sleep in here?" Damin asked.
"Oh no. If I sleep in here... well I can't," Mister G laughed. "Too much... thinking going on here to get a good night's rest. My room's upstairs." Mister G pointed to the staircase at the far end.
Damin nodded.
"Well then," Mister G scratched his scraggly forehead. "You should probably go back to manning the shop, in case someone comes in. But uh, feel free to come up any time it's not business hours," Mister G smiled.
Damian nodded, then gave a weak smile back.

Damian peered through the door and slowly pushed it open. He winced at the creek.
Billy was still on the floor, passed out, but his eyes fluttered open as Damin entered the room.
"So, you find anything?"
Damin turned to shut the door.
"Uhm... so much stuff."
Billy's eyes widened. "So he's got something we can steal?
"Well, yes... but, not exactly... I mean...,"
"Spit it out!" Billy got up. 
"Well..." Damin lowered to a whisper. "He's an... he's an inventor of some sort. He's got all sorts of stuff... but whether its valuable, or not, I don't know..."
"Well, did you see any shiny shit?" Billy asked.
"Not really, but uh, he's got some inventions... and a couple paintings..."
"Paintings," Billy pointed. "That can be good."
"But uh, I think he painted them himself. There's no way they're antiques," Damin said.
"So what? There's nothing worth stealing?" Billy's voice raised.
"I-- I don't know. There's just so much stuff, and it's all really weird. Maybe we could steal one of his blueprints and sell it to an industrialist."
Billy shook his head. "We're wanted, Damin. We can't do any legal business like that. And that's not gonna make us money *right now.*"
Damin stared down at the floor, thinking. Billy pushed past him.
"You know what? Fuck it. He's an old man, we can over power him. Sort through all his stuff, take over this operation if nothing else. It's worth at least the money we need," Billy said.
"Billy, stop!" Damin grabbed Billy's shoulder. "Come on. You're right, he's old. This is all he has, and he was enough to show me his stuff."
Billy looked Damin in the eye, and scowled.
"Don't do this," the teenager said.
Billy sighed and rolled his eyes. "Ugh, fine." He crouched down and reached under the bed, and grabbed a long bottle of rum.
"Well, guess I might as well relax then," Billy said as he popped open the bottle. 
Damin looked down, defeated.


Damin laid awake in bed, eyes open.
He stared up at the pitch blackness above him, which he knew to be Billy' bunk. From it, loud, violent, but repetitive snores.
Damin's fingers tensed up around his blankets. He bit his lip, then exhaled deeply.
He pushed off the blanket, then rolled out of bed.
Damin took a deep breath. He took off his shirt and pulled it tight before tying it around his own mouth as a gag. Then he took another deep breathe through his nose.
He outstretched his hands together in front of him, then extended one out from the other. As his hand moved, from the still one grew a dark yet glowing luminesensce, visible even in the pith black darkness. It was otherworldly-- one could immeadiately tell it was like a hallucination; it was as if smoke had an alien, captivating cousin.
He formed his hand up, and the gas-like substance grew with it, expanding. He jerked his moving hand back-and-forth, and two identical thin arms sprouted out from the thin smoky triangle.
Finally, he moved both hands up to the top of the triangle, where there was no substance yet, and then spun them around, as if he was grasping the surface of an invisible ball. And with that, the smoke grew a large head, with a long tail at the top of it exhausting like steam into the darkness.
And it had eyes. Large, crescent, violet, eyes that stayed in place, yet like the rest of it, moved like smoke. And it's mouth curled into a similar crescent form, before dissapearing into the same substance as the rest of its body.
Damin gave a small smile at his Creation. 
*You know what I need, Xanas. Lead me. Open the door.*
Xanas and its curved, pupiless eyes formed upwards with its similarly crescent mouth in a smile.
Xanas slithered under the door, its body seeming like gas. Then from behind, it gradually pushed open to let Damin through.
Damin winced as it squeked. He looked back-- but Billy kept snoring.
Damin slid through the door, peeking out first for Xanas. The small movement in the darkness, and those purple eyes, shined at the top of the stairs in the utter blackness.
Damin took each step with apprehension. He felt like the house would crash down at every step.
*Chhk-chhk-chhk-chhk*--
Damin's heart stopped. He knew it was the sound of Mister G's door unlocking, but in the dark, everything seemed louder, and every noise seemed a threat. Finally, he unfroze.
*Good, Xanas*, he thought. *Keep it quiet.*
A sudden FLASH OF COLOR AND LIGHT-- the pitch black turned into a crisp bright day on plains. An army SHOUTING--
Damin shouted, but it was muffled through the bedsheet. The vision dissapeared in an instant to black.
*It's nothing, Xanas. Keep going.*
The door opened at an uncomfortably slow speed, and Damin now followed only the smoke and eyes. He held his arm in a sneezing position to prepare for the curtain, which rubbed against it.
*You know what I'm after.* Damin took slow, direct steps towards Xanas, who turned around and reached straight out to Damin with a large smile, like a creepy kid showing his dad his toys. And those three toys were the six-shot, a large, silk bag-- a bag of ammo, and a beautifully crafted leather holster.
Damin took them from Xanas. *Good work, Xanas,* he thought. 

"Wake up, wake up!"
Billy erupted from the bed as his vision faded into a haze of light, and the rest darkness.
"Jeez, Damin! What is it? There's no way it's time for work yet!" Billy air-swatted his brother.
"I did it, Billy. But we have to go," Damin jumped down from Billy's bunk.
"Did WHAT?" Billy shouted.
"Shhh," Damin said. He sighed and held out the six-shot and the bag of ammo. "I got what you wanted."
Billy squinted in confusion. "What do you mean? What the fuck is that?"
"It's a gun. For you. To do the duel," Damin said.
"I have a fucking gun. That's not a fucking gun," Billy shimmied out his bed and jumped down.
"It's *more* than a gun," Damin said, turning the holster to Billy. "It shoots six bullets. The handle's *perfect*-- and it's *small*-- you can draw it faster than any other dueler. And the bullets--"
Billy yanked the gun and the bag of ammo out of Damin's hands and bent over next to the candlelight.
His eyebrows furrowed further as he rubbed his hands over the small ammo.
"What the fuck is this? What?" Billy laughed. "Is this a joke, or something? What is this gonna do, give the guy a bruise?"
"Billy, trust me, it fires a *lot* faster than a dueling pistol. I think it's undodgeable," Damin said.
"Pmpph. And how do you know that?" Billy set down the gun. "Did you shoot it?"
"Uhh...," Damin scratched the back of his neck. 
"Well, there's one way to find out," Billy picked up the gun and the bag and headed for the door.
"W-wait--"
Billy spun back to Damin. The teenager bounced back in surprise.
"Listen, Damin. Duel's at sunrise, and I got one shot," Billy shook the gun at the teen. "Now either this works, or it doesn't, and I'm dead. So I'm gonna go shoot this thing, and if it works like you say, we got our ticket. And if it doesn't, we're gonna get kicked out of the only place we can afford in town for stealing crazy Mister G's little toy here."
With that, Billy barged out of the room. Damin soon followed.

// consider cutting
Billy marched down the dusty, shrubed-sparsed hill. The hill was gradual, but he approached a giant cliff which led to a massive oval valley, with large ridges like the one he was standing on looping around it. 
In the valley, small cacti, rocks and birds populated a rather dull scene. 
Billy opened the bag of ammo. He glanced over the gun, then raised his eyebrow. Then he pressed on the cylinder, and it popped out. 
"Hm," Billy opened the bag of ammo, and back at the holes in the cylinder, and then popped in bullets one by one. 
Billy spun around to rapid footsteps.
"Here," Damin panted. "How are you gonna do a duel without a holster?"
"Oh," Billy's glare turned into a smirk. "Good memory, Damin." Billy took the holster with a nod and clipped it onto his belt. He took a deep breathe. 
His fingers wove up and down as he looked back over a nervous Damin, to the town over the hill. 
He shut his eyes. He stilled himself. His right hand moved to his side, his fingers still waving. 
Billy's eyes popped open. 
*ENGAGE.*
The world around Billy became a still image. Damin's lips were frozen in an O. A tumbleweed on the top of the hill froze in mid air.
*Fingers extended, relaxed. Index finger most extended. Push down hand. RELEASE.*
Billy's hand *zoomed* into the holster, but his vision did not move. The still image of his surroundings moved ever so slightly, but hardly even noticeable.
*ENGAGE. Wrap fingers around holster. Pull. RELEASE.*
Billy's arm *whipped* out of the holster. His right forearm, and the gun, entered his peripheral vision, which was still still.
*ENGAGE. *Pressure on balls of feet. Spin entire body right, bend knees. Keep spine centered, but lower neck. RELEASE.*
Billy spun around to face the dry valley in one rapid motion.
*ENGAGE.*
He froze on a still image of crows picking at some bugs some hundred or so feet away, most of it vertical.
Lower and level gun. Stabilize arm, extend forearm. RELEASE.*
Billy's arm shot down in his peripheral vision.
*SLOW.*
Billy leveled the sights right at the bird.
*ENGAGE. Hold breathe. Pull trigger. RELEASE.*
BAM.
The gun recoiled. SQUAWK SQUAWK. The other birds flew off in random directions.
And a hundred or so feet down the valley, bird brain was spilled out over rocks.
Billy looked at the gun in surprise. Then he quickly glanced up to see a bird flying about thirty feet out and above.
*ENGAGE. Extend arm. Stabilize gun. RELEASE.*
His sights were just in front of the bird, like the bird was going to fly into them.
*ENGAGE. Fire. Pull down. RELEASE.*
Billy fired, but pulled his hands to the right as he did so. 
*SLOW.*
Billy saw as the bullet, at about the speed of a man running if he could float, caught up with the bird, at about the speed of a toddler crawling. The bullet passed just in front of the bird. Billy's heart POUNDED. He was getting tired.
*RELEASE.*
Billy collapsed with his hands on his knees, and caught his breathe. The bird he tried to shoot SQUAKED and flew off.
"Woah!" Damian laughed and ran towards Billy. 
"Well that's ah... that's shot's hard to make," Billy said.
"But you came close, from the looks of it!" Damin said. "C'mon, you made that first shot, the thing looks pretty good!"
"It's not pretty good. It's fucking great!" Billy raised himself to face Damin. "You're right. I don't even know if this is dodgeable," Billy chuckled. "Dang, maybe Mister G's not so crazy after all." 
Billy snapped himself to attention, and swept up the ammo bag. 
"But we gotta go," he said.
"Too late mister," the plump, bald man said as he walked alongside Billy. "I chose ma man."
They were in a crowd of about a dozen or so, lined up on a long, dusty road, that was surrounded by large wood buildings, but not cramped. 
"C'mon. I'm a Subject, and I've got a great shot! And I got my own gun! And it's better than yours!" Billy shouted.
Parsmo paused to look Billy up and down, and his face curled in disgust. Billy was dressed like the rest of the crowd, in dirtied but plain clothing. "I highly doubt that."
"Alright Jimmy, ya ready?" Parsmo hollered at a stocky man with a black moustache. The man gave a solid nod back. He was armed with two 
"You said you would pick the best man! You'd see how good everyone shot," Billy said.
"Well, it's ma money on the line, and ma dispute," Parsmo walked towards the center square. 
"Well Callyhanny! Where's ya shoota?" Parsmo clutched his belt.
"He's right here," Callaghan, a tall, gray-haired man said. He pointed to a rectangular-faced, older man with a dust-stained formerly white hat with a rusted copper medal on its brim.
"He's a lawman! He--" Parsmo exclaimed.
"This is a public duel to settle our dispute. All that entails is that there's two duelists, with weapons, who start at the same time, at an agreed upon place. But the duelist can be anyone, as can the weapons," Callaghan gave a smug smile.
"Uhm, sorry Mister Parsmo," the moustached man said and handed Parsmo back two dueling pistols and a musket on his back. "I can't take this one."
"What?" Parsmo shouted.
"I guess you lose," Callaghan said with a smirk.
"I'll take it," Billy stepped forward.
"Billy he's a professional," Damin whispered. Billy stood still, ignoring his brother.
"O-Okay," Parsmo nodded and gave a too toothy, uncomfortable smile. "Yes. We still have a match."
"Billy!" Damin whisper-shouted. "He's not just a professional, he's a Subject Herald just like you. And probably a bit better."
Billy ignored his brother again, his glare unyielding at the lawman.
The lawman stepped forward, so that both him and Billy were face-to-face in the center of the dusty town road, surrounded by the crowd of around a dozen or so.
The lawman looked at Billy with a dead, grizzled stare. He was much older than Billy, his skin like a dried apricot. The previously noisy crowd came to a silence.
Finally, he uttered in a deep voice. "I'm a lawman, and the law's this: you can still quit. Walk away from the money, and if no one else steps up, Parsmo loses this spout. That's all. It's just walking away."
Billy looked down in thought.
"You don't gain anything... but you don't lose anything," the man looked at Billy with concern.
Billy's contemplating gaze snapped up into a predatory stare.
"No. I need this," he rasped.
The lawman paused, and looked down like a war had already been fought. But finally he gave an accepting nod. "Alright."

"Thirty-one, thirty-two..." Billy muttered under his breathe. 
"Fifty paces each. Fifty paces!" A portly man in the center shouted.


Billy gritted his teeth. His muscles strained, like instead of pushing back agaisnt air he was submerged in thick mud.
*ENGAGE. Prime slight right shoulder twist back, weight on balls of feet. Twist neck to keep in place. Elbow back, wrist to hip. RELEASE*
In the distance, the man had already drawn his gun.

He just pulled his shoulder and neck back as the small ball came flying by where his chest would have been. In the same motion, 
*ENGAGE.*
The musket ball froze in mid air. 
*Hold breathe. Use motion to twist arm out. Extend elbow. RELEASE.*
Lightning fast, Billy brought his 
Billy marched towards the lawman.
"Stop. This has six bullets. I just fired two. I have four more."
Billy held the gun inches from the lawman's face. The lawman stared up at Billy, biting his lip in a grimace. He raised his hands in surrender.
"Good," Billy said and holstered his weapon.
"Ho-ho!" Parsmo shouted. "Five $Dunnes, as promised."
"The rule of a duel is, the winner is whichever shooter makes the other drop to the ground."
Billy glanced from the spectator to the bloodied lawman.
Lightning fast, he cocked the lawman in the face.
The lawman's body fell the the ground with a *thump.*
"There. Dropped to the ground," Billy rasped. "Now get him a fucking doctor."
