Theme: The balance between ideals and reality

Culturally, the Zhenists believe Aredal to be a much more worldly God, ie the goal should be that the world is united as one under him and serves him in a collectivist theocracy

Synodontis: Synodontis is held to the ideal of his father, Aredal, who is worshipped as a God. (Trying to be a God as a man)

1\.   Synodontis kills Wosa because Wosa didn’t hold to his unyielding ideal of loyalty that Aredal was known for (the people act as if they owe the Synodontis loyalty) (Synodontis does not have mercy and/or forgiveness)

2\. Synodontis becomes totalitarian and continues to try to fulfill this impossible image of Aredal although of course it is impossible. He destroys all who stand in his way of fulfilling his vision of a united empire under one infallible God.

3\. Previa joins Synodontis’ court as he always wished and becomes his advisor (possibly because he became Impalias and in the unction plan Synodontis wanted a religious advisor; Previa has the idea that Synodontis is some legendary God and an infallible being. Previa at first encourages Synodontis to be more God-like and worships him. But over time (book II) Previa sees that Synodontis has issues and trauma and begins to accept that he is not a God and that it’s okay that he isn’t. Previa discovers that Synodontis murdered Wosa which connects to a theme that Synodontis has been unable to forgive himself for killing his mentor.

OKIN/BILLY Symmetry

Both are about leaving their small environments and finding the wider world, but **Okin** discovers the world is less perfect and more corrupt then he originally thought while **Billy** discovers the world is more helpful and less corrupt then he originally thought

Billy does not want to adhere to any ideals and thinks ideals are for idiots, Okin thinks he can adhere to all his ideals, slowly both of these notions get wittled away until Okin uncovers the fact that all his ideals are fabricated and Billy discovers he can hold himself to some higher ideals
