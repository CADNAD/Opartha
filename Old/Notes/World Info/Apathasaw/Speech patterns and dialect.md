Apathasawians speak a language fairly similar to Modern Trentanian, but have been trained from a young age to abbreviate, conjunct, and eliminate all unneccesary words to deliver a message in the shortest understandable manner possible. Here’s an example of a normal phrase “Apathasawian-ized”:

Trentanian: Damn it Jake! Why can’t you ever do anything remotely as I tell you to?

Apathasawian: Damn Jake! Can’t you do anything I say?

Also, “I”, as the most common subject, is implied unless otherwise stated.
