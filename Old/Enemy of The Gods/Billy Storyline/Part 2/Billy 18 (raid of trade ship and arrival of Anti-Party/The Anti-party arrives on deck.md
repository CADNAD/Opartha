“Captain!” A bony man with almost as little hair as he had fat waved at Kiatus after crossing one the adjacent planks. “Karnes and I spotted something this morning, another one of those flying jelly ships’ been following us back there.” He pointed back to the rougher waters of the Strait where they had approached from, and pulled out a black monocular from his waist as if to re-confirm his own thesis for himself.

“Yep, they’re still on our trail!” The thin man gave a crooked smile and handed Kiatus the monocular, leaning in as the Captain took a look. Billy shielded his eyes, trying to get a glimpse of whatever they were searching for---and yes, through some wispy clouds, there was a distant, approaching object that did look something like a ship.

“Hmm. Good find,” Kiatus turned to Billy. “Did you have some more friends you didn’t tell me about?”

Billy swallowed---but Kiatus’ eyes weren’t laden with rage, in fact they seemed to sparkle, as did his pearly white teeth.“No friends. I think---I think they want to capture us,” Billy said. “Or worse.”

“Enemies, huh?” Kiatus looked back out with the monocular. “I wonder what you did to get someone to chase you here on a flying ship.”

Billy shivered. How did those crazy cultists follow them here? 

“Anchor and wait for them to approach,” Kiatus rested the spyglass telescope by his side and his minions pulled the bridges back on deck and scrambled to the back of the vessel.

“Where did you come from, Billy? Who is following you?”

“I---,”

“No, don’t tell me,” the Captain smiled. “A band of very determined, flying airships, full of people who all happen to be Heralds. I finally think I’ve found something new.”

There was a metal churning as the crew dropped the anchor to the sea floor, and Kiatus smile widened with the drop of the chain. The sails bloated against the wind until the pirates flattened them, and they fell limp and sideways. The ship was a still and silent constant as the waves rushed past to where the rest of Kiatus’ fleet fought and pillaged.

Billy’s heart beat faster the closer the flying vessel got. Now he could make out that translucent, light pee-coloured blob that pulled the ship along and towards them. His nose scrunched, that thing’s guts had been all over him after it had absolutely destroyed his eardrums. He still wasn’t sure whether he should thank or curse Kiatus for shooting it down--- he hadn’t really had time to process any of it.

In the vibrant chaos of the pirates running around, stuffing the temporary bridges in the right spot and throwing around booze and weapons, Billy started to look around, trying to get a clear view. Kiatus just stood there, eyes wide like a child about to receive a new toy. Billy left him and shoved through the crowd. Where was Damian?

His search for his brother grew more frantic and rushed, as his intent became clearer. They were coming, those violent, crazy Heralds who believed Billy had cursed their strange gods. And Kiatus was letting them. 

Billy finally spotted a dark mop of hair sitting at a table, playing some card game with that red-bearded pirate and Benjamin. 

“Damian!” Billy shouted. “We have to go! Those Monastery fuckers, they followed us here!”

“What?” Damian jumped out of his seat and glanced around. “Where are they?”

“In that ship, up there,” Billy pointed to the flying vessel in the sky, which was now only a few ship-lengths away. “C’mon, we have to hide. You too, Benjy.”

The large man nodded and the two turned to follow Billy.

“What do you think you’re doing?” The red-bearded pirate asked, eliciting a turn from Billy. 

“We have to hide. Please, we just want to survive,” Billy said.

The red-bearded man grunted, then pointed his thumb down.

“Go below deck, then. No one ever checks down there, and you’ve got the most time and ample warning to ambush your opponents if they do. And you---you probably just gotta pray on Kiatus.”

Billy gave an appreciative nod. Maybe---just maybe, there were *some* men that weren’t either sheep or horrid monsters.

The three trudged past a few pirates who were still celebrating and ’sorting’ their boon, and Billy crouched down once he had found that little metal latch in the deck. The trapdoor wasn’t exactly *hidden*---but one could miss it if they weren’t looking at the floor, and the jubilant pirates would likely distract the enemy from examining the ground.

Billy jammed open the planked hatch, and let Damian climb down the ladder first. The rabbling pirates didn’t even seem to notice them, most of them were carrying crates and already-opened booze to the back of the boat. Only Kiatus still stood at the front with that thin, bald lieutenant; a big grin on his face, still occasionally checking that wooden spyglass.

“Get in, Billy,” Billy looked down the hole, where Benjamin was already standing on the darkened floor below. Billy obliged and climbed down the ladder, shuttering them into almost complete darkness after descending the first few rungs.

The three of them huddled directly in front of  the ladder, and it footsteps were so thundering above that a childish part of Billy feared they would crack through the deck and fall upon him, especially as the little bit of light that peeked through the thin gaps in the deck were darkened by an array of boots.

The ensemble of footsteps closed off one by one until there was not a sound above.

“Men, make way, make way,” Billy heard Kiatus’ voice. Then there was a rapid scramble of footsteps directly above Billy, and once again, silence. 

“What is happening?” Damian said. Billy uncraned his neck, but he couldn’t even make out his brother. 

“I don’t know, just stay put, and stay silent.”

“Billy,” Benjamin whispered. “What about Allia?”

*Shit.* Where was that crazy girl? She’d mostly been moping around since they’d been captured by Kiatus, but Billy thought she’d been with Benjamin and Damian most of the time.

“We have to get her,” Benjamin said. “She doesn’t know they are coming.”

“There’s no time now,” Billy replied.

“Whoever you may be!” Kiatus’ voice blared through the cracks in the deck. “I highly suggest that you anchor your ship and hop down so we may discuss whatever the reason is that you are following us.”

“And if we do---you will guarantee us no harm?” A fuzzy, higher-pitched voice asked, sounding close enough to be directly adjacent to Kiatus’ vessel now. Billy froze---the voice sounded oddly familiar.

“You have my word,” Kiatus responded.

There was a crashing sound from the deck above, and another, and another. 

“Greetings,” Kiatus said. “And welcome aboard.”

“Thank you, kind sir,” the high-pitched voice said. That tone---

Billy’s stomach sank. It was Jerel that had boarded.\[ Good end hook\]
