The sheet of darkness choked the rays of sunlight out of the sky.

Okin peeked out of his hallway to check for any lingering Istars. It was clear.

So he sneaked out of his room, lantern in hand. He quietly closed the door behind him.  Tiptoeing out of the halls of the visiting complex, he made his way onto the street. The street lamps had been extinguished, and his dim sphere of light was the only source in sight.

With a stiff posture, he began to walk towards the market section of The Citadel. If he was spotted sneaking around, there would be no excuse, but if he looked normal, he could possibly lay it off that he was just lost.

But there were no other men out in the night. Or at least none that would confront the wandering Ather. 

Okin shivered as he approached the idle alley, the memories of the execution were not comforting in the utter darkness. Okin placed a hand on the wall to maintain his sense of balance, trekking forward carefully in the little dome of light which his lantern bore.

Okin crouched, inching his way towards the small gap in the buildings, the minuscule alley-within an alley. He held out his lantern forward, and sure enough, lit up a small-hill shaped figure, covered in blankets.

*So at least he is a man of his word on remaining in this spot.*

Okin stood back up, checking his peripherals before speaking to the slump.

“Hello.”

Slowly, Ateon peeked out from underneath the blanket, his face just as shielded behind the thick beard and scruffy hair. “Ah, you’ve returned,” he said. “Must’ve found something, then.”

Okin nodded. “It appears that this supposed Fourth Book of Nexon really does exist. That answers one question, but asks many more.”

The vagrant laughed. “I knew you would be curious. But now is not the time for curiosity. How did you confirm its existence?”

“I-I asked a friend,” Okin said.

“Don’t worry, you can be more specific. As you can probably tell, I don’t know many in The Citadel, at least by name,” the man laughed.

Okin sighed. All this man had seemed to be after was a couple coins, and an eccentric sense of religious discovery; there would likely be no harm in telling him the Truth.

“A fellow Ather of mine, Ather Previa, who is the son of Impalias Aldwin, asked his father about the existence of the book, and his father confirmed it,” Okin replied. 

“Hm, so you have a direct connection to an Impalias! That is quite impressive. And all the more impressive that you got that information out of him,” the man said.

“Yes,” Okin said. “But it doesn’t matter. I am to be leaving The Citadel tonight.”

The bearded vagabond’s cheery smile faded. “But why? You have just gotten the key to a house of wonders which you’ve been waiting for your entire life! How can you give up now?”

“I have only done it by betraying that which is most important to me, the tenant of the Truth,” Okin replied, head hung low. “I told Aldwin that this was the last night I would stay in The Citadel, and I don’t intend to lie again.”

Ateon scratched his beard, shuffling closer to Okin.

“Well, sometimes we all have to bend what is important to us in order to truly move forward. Yes, you may have told a small lie, but only in an effort to unveil the real Truth, so that all may know of it. It is what the Gods would have done, yes. It is true, Olitheon values Wisdom more than his brother, and Intillia will always stand for Peace. But there is one tenant that unites all of the Four, the tenant that is most important, and it is the one that *you* have chosen.”

Okin spoke up, his voice syncing with the man. “Sacrifice.”

The vagrant nodded, “and you must continue our Sacrifice in order to unveil the Truth to the world, and to deliver Justice.”

The exasperated Ather sat down on the wet stone pavement, dirtying the bottom of his robes, but he didn’t move.   His eyes laid upon the muddy puddles and the dark, cracked stone, but they were not the focus. His real vision faded as the events of the past few days dominated his mind. The page of the mysterious Fourth Book that still rested in his pocket. Dabria’s smiling face. The demonic screams of that servant of Tregale. The challenging finger of the Arbiter of Bravery, who he had turned away from. 

*Sacrifice. The Gods...*Aredal...*he’s right. I must make this Sacrifice.*

“Fine. I guess... I will continue my investigation. I will find the real Truth.”

Ateon chuckled, patting a wet hand on Okin’s back.

“That’s the spirit, my friend.”

“But---,” Okin pointed a stern finger at the beggar. “I will do it the right way. I will still maintain my Truth, and all of my Dedication.”

The vagrant nodded, and even appeared to be smiling cheerfully.

“Good,” he gave Okin a pat on the back, and the Ather flinched at the man’s wet palm.

Okin looked around Ateon, there were only torn blankets and discarded trash. No sign of the supposed Fourth Book.

“So then, how did *you* get this Fourth Book of Nexon?”

The man laughed, raising a hand and shaking it at Okin. “As I said, Okin, the time for curiosity comes later.”

Okin stared down in disappointment. This strange hobo had access to a piece of the Versalist history which he had never seen, and the fraction which had been revealed to him were already bending his deeply rooted beliefs. Crazy vagabond or not, Okin had to look further, at least to quell the raging “what ifs” that would continue to haunt him by exposing the mysterious vagrant. If it meant playing by this strange man’s strange rules, so be it.

“Fine. But when *is* later?”

The edges of the man’s scruffy beard turned upwards. “Well, that depends on how hard you work.”

“Work on what?” Okin’s eyebrows raised.

Ateon chuckled again. “I will give you the information you desire, if you help me find the information that *I* desire.”

“And what information is that?” Okin asked.

“I’m glad you asked. It sweetens the deal for you,” Ateon replied.

Okin let out a sigh of frustration. Was this vagrant just bored, running around an obviously inquisitive Ather with vague promises and false rhetoric, just to amuse himself? Or were the secrets he held really that critical that the man had to trust Okin before he could release them?

Ateon raised his hand. “Well, I know you are probably not fond of investigating and going around the backs of other Athers, but you must be willing, as you’ve done it already. The Citadel holds more secrets than you think, my friend. And while I have picked up a few dropped puzzle pieces, I do not have the whole picture.

“There is more to this world than you think, my friend. Only together do we have a chance to uncover the mystery.”

Okin shivered. Perhaps it was the dark of the cold night, or the fear that another would catch him speaking to this strange, disheveled vagrant, but most likely it was the fear that there was something sinister behind the veneer---something malicious about the institution which he had served for all his life. The vagrant’s appearance was off-putting, but the more he revealed, the more it seemed as if this was a front, a disguise so he would seem unthreatening to those he was hoping to expose. Perhaps his mysterious nature actually made him more likely to be trustworthy.

“I will accept--- I will help you find the information you need, as long as I am also able to use it, and able to say no to tasks which I do not wish to perform,” Okin finally said. 

“Well good!” Ateon shouted. “So we are partners now, High Ather Okin.” 

A shaky hand slid out from underneath the ripped cloak. 

Okin squinted uncomfortably as he reached forward.  As expected, the man’s hand was slimy and wet. He continued to shake much longer than Okin would’ve wished.

Okin jerked his hand back as soon as Ateon released his grip. He shook off the moisture from his hand.

Okin stepped away from the man to rub the last particles of water off onto his robe. “So, what am I to do now?”

“Well, we must find the necessary information to prove this conspiracy. You know that Aldwin is involved now. And so I say you should probably follow that lead.”

Okin nodded. He pictured himself confronting Aldwin.He was *furious* that one of the men he trusted most out of any would dare hide something like this from him, and that anger translated into his visualization. He shouted at Aldwin, pointing a sharp finger at him and revealing his conspiracy to the crowd. 

He took a deep breath. Yes, he was angry, but he would not be Wrathful. The image fleeted from his mind.

“Yes, I agree. I know that as an Impalias, Aldwin speaks in front of large groups at the Twelve Cathedrals\[ 2021-09-07, 2:48 PM

Might be Twelve Cathedrals fro Minor Gods, Four Cathedrals for Major Gods, or also Sixteen Cathedrals when talking about them all as a group.\] all the time. It’ll be even more now, seeming as he is actively going out to spread support for Previa,” Okin said.

“Support for Previa?” Ateon raised an eyebrow.

“Oh yes. Aldwin is pushing Previa to run as an Impalias in the upcoming election.”

“Interesting,” Ateon said. “Well, it is good that you have him on your side.

*Indeed,* Okin thought. *Whoever thought* Previa *of all people would be the most useful ally?*

“Well as I was saying, I will find Aldwin when he is amongst our peers, and I will get him to admit what he has done in front of some of the most esteemed clergy of The Citadel,” Okin said.

“I am not sure that strategy will labor much fruit. This is a *hidden* conspiracy, after all,” Ateon chuckled.

Okin nodded mindlessly. Still, in his head, he knew he would do it. What else could he do that would not betray his value of Truth?

“Well, *good luck*, Okin,” Ateon’s voice was surprisingly kind and soothing. “I know you will find the right way.”

The homeless man pulled the blanket over his head, covering himself completely. Okin stood befuddled, holding the dying lantern in the freezing night, staring at the sheltered hump. It did not move.

Sighing, Okin turned back down the lonesome alley. In the past two weeks, he had lied to a guard in Metheno, manipulated his best friend, and just put his trust in a dirty, giggling vagabond.

*Oh Aredal, please let me believe I am doing this in the name of Truth, Bravery, and Justice.*
