The boards creaked back and forth in harmony with the nauseating sway of the ship.  A ball of spit dribbled down Billy’s cheek and dropped several feet from the top bunk onto the grimy wooden floor.

With an unpleasant creak, the wooden door swung open, making a large thunk as the iron knob hit the inner wall.  

“Billy!  We’re almost there!  I can see the coastline.”  Damian’s excited face hovered above Billy, who had not eaten in several days, or at least not had any of the food actually reach his belly.  Billy scrunched his nose as the smell of fish, grime and salt awakened it. Slowly sliding off the bed, he latched onto the frame as the ship tilted to one side.

Finally getting his feet planted on the ground, Billy wiped his eyelids with the back of his left hand.  “Can’t fucking sleep at sea," he said, dilly-dallying toward the doorway.

“C’mon, you gotta look, it’s beautiful," Damian said, wrapping an arm around his friend’s torso.  Billy swatted it away.  

“Fine.”

Billy hobbled up the stairs, squinting and covering his eyes with his hands as the blistering light shot through his barrier. As he got to the top stair, he looked up and through the fences, seeing the captain at the helm of the ship.  In the centre of the ship were the rest of the crew members, including Benjamin, drinking in camaraderie.  With a hearty chuckle, a man with a long, scruffy blonde beard slammed his mug against a wooden table.  He was joking around and drinking with Benjamin and another one of the crew, a thin, dark-skinned man.  The sight of it made Billy groan.

“C’mon, we’re basically here, you have to see the coastline," Damian said to Billy, motioning for him to come to the front portside of the ship.  

Billy shrugged away from Damian.   “I don’t care about a fucking coastline.  Why’d you wake me up?”

“We haven’t seen Wreathward in over a decade.  I just thought you’d appreciate seeing it from a distance," Damian replied.

“Yeah, well I can see it after we land and I get some fuckin’ sleep," Billy answered back, storming back down the steps and to the bedroom.  

Billy scrambled up onto the top bunk of the bed, covering himself with the thin woolen blanket.  Turning over, he used his hands to block out the noise of the waves from one ear and covered the other with the blanket.  It was no use.  The boat continued to rock, and Billy kept getting pushed forward towards the edge of the bed.  Turning onto his back, Billy closed his eyes, but the sound of the waves and the rocking was just too much.  

With a frustrated grunt, Billy threw the blanket off the side of the bed, and jumped off onto it.  Gnashing his teeth, he pulled open the bedroom door and it slammed against the wall.  He stomped up the stairs,  the shining light now less of an adjustment than before. Damian was now playing cards at the table with the other crew members.  

Billy walked over to the table, which had a pile of Apathasawian paper bills in the centre--- the pot.  Damian was holding two cards, facing the viking-looking man, who also held two.  Benjamin and the thin tan man had folded.

The centre already had three cards down, Space nine, Time seven, God of Time.

The blonde-bearded man took the pile of cash closest to him on the table; picking out a few bills from the bunch, he threw them into the pot.

“Raise twenty.”

Looking up to the blonde-bearded man, Damian studied his face, before taking a few bills from his stash and throwing them toward the centre.  

“Re-raise sixty.”

With a deep sigh, the blonde-bearded man slammed his cards onto the table. 

“Fold.”

Damian gave a small smile as he collected the money from the centre.  

“How are you so good against me?” the man asked.

Damian shook his head, a slight smirk forming on his face as he approached Billy.

The man chuckled heartily. “Remind me never to play with you again!”

Damian leaned over to Billy, cupping hands around his ear, “Whenever he’s a bit weak, he always looks down and to the left. It’s a pretty easy tell,” he whispered.

*Impressive*, Billy thought to himself.  He had never seen Damian gamble, although he literally had the perfect skillset to do so, but not the balls to risk getting kicked out of a saloon.

Damian pulled away from the whisper and smiled. “Couldn't sleep?” 

“Yeah.  Looks like you’ve won quite a few pots there," Billy said, looking to the large wad of cash in Damian’s hand.

“Yeah, that game was quite a fun time," Damian smiled.

“Well... you think maybe we could give them some of that cash back in exchange for some beer?” Billy asked with excited eyes.

Damian smiled softly.  “Sure, Billy.”

“Thanks, buddy," Billy said, giving Damian a pat on the back, and then turned to the other men at the table, who were joking around. “So, how much would it be for two bottles of beer?”

The blonde-bearded man spoke up.  “I’ll give you two bottles for... eighty!”

*Eighty?  That’s fucking ridiculous!*  All he had to do is steal some from the cargo without getting caught, right?

“Ah, cheap bastard wants all money back," Benjamin laughed.  “I give bottle for twenty-five each, Billy.”

The dark, skinny man interjected, “Wait, wait.  I give two for thirty.”

A shocked look came from Benjamin, who turned to the thin man.  “Why cut me?”

“It just competitive pricing.  Thirty paper is better than two beers for me," the skinny man replied.

“But these are my friends!" Benjamin replied.

The thin man looked to Benjamin with a witty grin.  “If really were your friends, you wouldn’t charge fifty paper for two beers!”  The four men burst into laughter at an unamused Benjamin, who eventually gave in and began laughing along.  The skinny dark-skinned man got up from his chair, but was stopped by Damian’s voice.

“Wait, could I maybe give you an extra fifteen and you get one for Benjamin too?”

Laughing, Benjamin shook his head.  “Just get me one from my stash, Silvio.”

Billy’s jaw dropped. “Stash?  How much do you guys have?”

“Lots.  Sometimes we don’t return home for months.  Olitheon Transport has deal with many brewing corporations, extra supply in exchange for cheap shipping rate.  Captain gives option, take small cut from salary in exchange for ample beer supply at sea.”

“And of course we all do it!” the blonde-bearded man shouted, raising his mug to the air.  The ectomorphic man ran down the deck, towards the Captain’s cabin, disappearing down a staircase near the back of the ship.

Billy smiled.  “Maybe I should’ve worked transport instead of security.”

“Yeah, you’d spend all your time cleaning up your own vomit!” Benjamin burst into laughter again.  

“Shut up, Benjy," chuckling, Billy slapped the huge man on the back.

The skinny man came pounding up the steps, three bottles smooshed between his arms.  He pulled out one bottle by the neck and handed it to Billy, and then to Damian, and then finally to Benjamin.  

“Thanks, Silvio," Damian said, handing him the cash.  Silvio did a quick count, and then smiled, pushing the wad into his pocket.

“Hey, Damian," Billy said, and Damian turned to face him attentively.  “Why don’t we go check out the coastline?”

Smiling, Damian replied, “Sure Billy.”  Waving to the crew, Damian and Billy walked towards the front of the deck, starboard side, and leant against the side of the ship.
