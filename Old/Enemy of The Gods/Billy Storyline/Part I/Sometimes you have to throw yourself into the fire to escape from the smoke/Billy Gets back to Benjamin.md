Faster, faster, faster. Billy pushed his body as he ran down towards the docks. Bathed in the orange glow of oil lamps, the docks were a blinding spot of light in the darkness. Around those lamps, sailors and citizens alike mingled, each distinguishable to Billy, despite the distance. Farther in the distance, there were four boats moored to the dock. Like he predicted, most had left before sundown. Majority of the merchants had been from nearby along the coast, making it easy enough for them to make it back home in time for dinner. Apathasawian ships were on a tight schedule too, so they often avoided staying in port too long, at least when abroad. It was hard to make out the exact shapes of each boat, but none looked like the ones they had taken here. None of them bore the massive steam wheels common on Apathasawian ships. Had Benjamin left him? *That bastard better not have*, he thought to himself.  

“Billy,” Damian called. From behind, the boy was weakly swinging his arms as he ran. “Can we take a break? I... I don’t know how much longer I can run for.” 

Billy glanced to the dock, they were maybe another kilometre away. If Damian was asking to take a break, they had to be nearly there. That boy would be too shy to ask otherwise. Looking over his other shoulder, their strange jail breaker followed. She had been silent since their escape, not divulging even her name. At least she wasn’t weighing them down, not that he would stop for her. But she wasn’t just fast, she was perfect. She always matched Billy’s pace, never faulted, and most importantly she moved completely silently. As Billy analyzed the strangeness of this girl, their eyes met. Those diamond glowing eyes. Each one had a ghostly, enchanting quality to them. They chilled him to his bone, yet he couldn’t look away.

“Fine. We’re not too far off, we can snake in through the back alley. Might make it easier to avoid anyone else.” Billy slowed his run to a brisk walk. He’d let Damian recover, but they couldn’t stop. Every second here was a second closer to being found out. The girl followed, dropping into a walk right behind him. 

“And what’re you gonna do? He asked her. 

She perked up, “I shall wait. I am simply an observer to the will of the Forces.” The girl bowed her head lightly, dodging around the question. 

“Yeah? And are they gonna come help us get out of this mess?” Billy said. 

“I cannot say. It is the place of none to predict the will of the forces. We must simply entrust them with our fortune.” 

Well, he would be the one to get Damian and himself out of this mess. It would be him, not some godly force barely even watching, made up in some children’s fairytale.

The trio drew closer to the urban area around the dock. The sounds of laughter and music warmed the streets.Billy heard the pulling of strings and clapping of hands and feet against the wood. The fast strings of the Tabour creating the frantic melody of the song.

“Billy...” Damian said softly from behind. “It’s a Jonce. I haven’t heard one in so long.” The youth’s voice was almost hopeful as he ran ahead toward the sound. 

Silently, Billy cursed before following Damian. The jig was coming from one of the many taverns which lined the street. Looking through a stained glass window, Billy could see the band. Sat in a corner of the interior, a small crowd gathered, dancing around them. But Billy eyes were caught by something else, someone else. In the corner of the tavern, a familiar face with dark brown skin and a bald head sat, slumped against his chair. A light brown leather vest, unbuttoned and stained over a dark brown buttoned shirt. That bastard was drinking himself away. 

“It’s Benjamin!” Damian said, he turned to Billy eyes gesturing to the slumped figure.

“Yeah. We best go pay the man a visit,” Billy gritted his teeth and rounded the corner, pushing through the tavern doors. The double doors slammed opened, drawing the attention of a few patrons, just not even to be suspicious. A warm, humid, air hit Billy as he stepped into the room. It was larger than it appeared from the outside. A stone hearth was opposite the dancing crowd, and a wooden bar sat across him. Benjamin was next to the hearth, taking sips of a deep brown liquor. 

Billy snaked his way through patrons before he came face-to-face with his friend. As he took a chair from an adjacent table, the legs scraped against the stained wood flooring. 

“Well, well, well, look what we got here. Drinking yourself away, you son of a bitch.” Billy said. 

Benjamin took a long sip of his liquor. “You first,” he finally said. His words were more slurred than usual. They weren’t clipped at the ends with that sense of urgency Apathasawians always had. Rather, he seemed\[ f.w.\] almost relaxed for once. 

“Got held up’s all,” Billy reached for the liquor but was swatted away by the other man. 

“Ain’t gettin none till ya tell me where you were.” 

Billy sighed, trying to contain his annoyance, “got into a little tussle. Ain’t no big deal long as you got a way back.” 

He did have a way back, didn’t he? Benjamin had to have one, he was Billy’s only real option of escape at this point. The previous guards’ shifts would be over soon, and when the next ones came, there was no hiding his escape. 

“O, I’s got way back. But not for you.” Benjamin refilled his drink, eyes Billy as he did.

“The cink you mean, not for me?” 

“Means ya took too long.  Unless you got enough to pay up again, and double?” 

*Damn the Four*, Billy thought to himself. Leaning over the table quickly, he grabbed Benjamin by his collar. The man’s limp body was easily jerked forward as Billy brought his face close. 

“Listen here *buddy,* I didn’t break myself outta fucking jail just to get stranded here, alright?”

Something in Billy’s sudden aggression snapped Benjamin to attention. The man blinked away the solemn vacancy in his eyes before asking, “What did you just say about jail?”

“Broke myself outta jail. What’s what?” Well, he hadn’t exactly done it himself, it had been that girl, as much as he hated to admit that fact. *Speaking of the girl, where in the six continents did she go?* Turning, he spotted\[ 2021-01-20, 6:27 PM

F.w\] her at a nearby table, speaking quietly with another man. The man wore a sailing hat, white with a small brim, and a dark blue uniform of some sort. On the left shoulder of his unbuttoned coat was a coat of arms: two crossed spears behind a yellow lion, which was the coat of arms of  House Pégon, one of the most influential houses in Wreathward. The man leaned against the bar, smiling, and was poured the girl a drink. She had her hood off and for the first time Billy could propely see her face. She looked younger in the tavern light, less intimidating, with softened features. Her dark brown hair was tired up in a bun, an oddity which drew glances from the crowd. 

“Jail?” Benjamin asked again. His voice was a suppressed yell, but a yell nonetheless. “One day, and you end up in jail?” 

“It’s not my fault, but it happened anyway, so we gotta go. How’s that sound?” Billy could read the shock in Benjamin’s face clear as day.

The man stuttered “Ship won’t be here for four days at least,” he finally managed. “You can ask about getting passage then...” 

Billy jerked his friend to the side, “We need to go, *now*!” 

From behind, Damian tugged at Billy. “Please... just listen to him, won’t you?” 

Begrudgingly, Billy let go of the other man. He stumbled for a moment before slowly sitting back down in his chair across from Billy. 

“Even then, I know you ain’t got the money to pay,” Benjamin said, drinking again. “And your fault we are all here. I stayed behind for you.”

Anger flared within Billy, but his friend was right. Unless Benjamin could convince the next crew to honour Billy’s bribes to the previous crew, he was stuck. Suddenly, a symphony of bells rung out, freezing Billy. A signal. They had found the two dead guards, and would be searching for him soon enough. There was no waiting four days, he had to run now. 

From behind, someone cleared their throat.  “If I may, I believe you require a solution to your problem of escape?”

Something about the way she spoke irritated Billy. The way she almost looked down on him, offering her hand to save him. 

“I think we’ll be f-“ Billy started his reply, but was caught off guard by a frantic Damian.

“Yes! Yes! That would be wonderful...” the words poured out of his mouth as he stepped between Billy and the girl. 

She gave Damian a nod before turning to Billy. “Though you may not feel the need to take it, I will help your friend escape, and my offer to you stands.” 

Billy groaned, he couldn’t very well leave Damian alone. “Fine, I’ll go with ya.” 

“What about your other friend?” She gestured to Benjamin, across the table. He looked up, vacancy in his face. Billy couldn’t pierce his thoughts, his stoic face hiding away any emotion.

“In, these two will make trouble, so I come.” Didn’t he have a ship back home in just four days? It wouldn’t be that much trouble to just wait it out, coming with them would be more trouble than it was worth.

“I can make the proper arrangements,” she said. 

“The proper arrangements? You don’t even have a cinking plan yet,” Billy seized the girls arm, fingers slipping against the smooth cloak. “Those bells mean we’ve been found out, they’re probably sending their dogs out to hunt us right now.” The girl made a twisting motion, slipping out of his grip with ease. 

“Your patience would be appreciated,” she said. Her voice was blunt, more serious than how she had previously spoken. There was a nervousness in her eyes. This girl was quite the conundrum, one moment dodging his questions, baiting him into speaking, the next nervously begging a chance to give mercy. Two-faced is what his father would have called people like her. 

“At least tell me your cinking name,” Billy said. The girl looked back at him stopping to consider the request.

The girl bit her lip, pausing.  “Allia,” she finally said. “My name is Allia. Please, just wait here, or outside. I promise you we will leave as soon as possible.” Allia took a step away from them, moving towards the sailor she had been speaking to earlier. *This girl really doesn’t have a plan. She’s just planning on seducing Damian for her own weird motives, and Benjamin as well to get him to go with us.* Of course she didn’t have a plan, the jail break was shoddy at best, and nothing since then had indicated a plan of any sort. 

Allia stopped next to the man, who had two beers in hand now. She stuck her hand under the collar of her cloak, and fished out a necklace. It was a smooth obsidian black material, shaped into a symbol completely foreign to Billy. Four circular dots sat at the points of a square diamond. Two snakes crossing in a double helix made the outside of the diamond, and in the very centre sat a small orange gem stone shaped like a star so that the the four tips each connected to one circle. 

“To Hwasadon we must return,” she said. Instantly, the man snapped to attention. Hastily, he gave a deep bow to Allia before setting down the two drinks. 

“To our destiny, the Forces guides us,” the man replied.

Allia clasped his shoulder, squeezing lightly. “With haste, destiny shall be fulfilled.” 

The man nodded, and the girl released him. Instantly the man straightened, seeming reborn. Whipping around he quickly buttoned his double breasted coat and began yelling around the bar. Other lounging sailors begrudgingly heeded him as they finished the last sips of their drinks. Running through the tables, the man--- who Billy could now tell was clearly their commanding officer--- pulled some of his men away from their drinks. 

“The hell that girl do?” Benjamin asked from behind. He was on his feet now, lightly stumbling as he walked. 

“Ain’t sure, but looks like it worked,” he said. Billy couldn’t help but chuckle. While the girl gave off an unsettling, powerful aura, she was still just a girl. A girl of much lower social standing than anyone these sailors typically reported to, yet the scrambled to her every whim. 

“I think,” Damian finally spoke as he watched the sailors leaving the tavern. “That their captain is also part of the Order of Tsuman.” 

Billy shot a confused look at Damian, who continued. “Well... I’m not sure. No one really knows that much about them, but I remember reading once that they have members in all walks of life.”

“Cinking sleeper agents. This gets better and better,” Billy mumbled. 

“I would appreciate if you begin moving,” Allia said. The girl stood by the door, hood drawn. “You are the one who made such an insistence on speed.”  

She really did only get more and more annoying. Begrudgingly, the three followed her out of the tavern and into the night. Outside, Billy could see the sailors prepping the ship to leave, tossing lines about and shouting commands at each other.

“They seem good,” Benjamin said. While Billy didn’t have the faintest idea what constituted a good or bad crew of sailors, he trusted Benjamin’s assessment. 

“So maybe we’re not *cunk*,” Billy strode forward starting into a light jog. Freedom was close, they were on the edge of it, but those bells. The bells that rung out. The bells that had awoken townspeople who now looked about in panic. The bells which reminded him of a constant, impending terror. He broke out into a run. Behind, Damian yelled at him to stop, but he was too close to take any precautions. A good call.
