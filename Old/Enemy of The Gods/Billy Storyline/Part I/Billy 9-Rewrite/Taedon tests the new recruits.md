“Hello, Dakung Taedon,” Allia bowed so deep, it looked as if she was going to fall flat on her face. The thought made Billy smirk. 

“Allia,” the grey-haired newcomer, Taedon, said, stepping out in front of the three guards. “You have finally come back. Who might these be?” He gestured to Billy, Benjamin, and Damian.

“New recruits, Dakung,” Allia replied.

“Hm,” Taedon grunted, peering down at the three men. He even seemed to leer at Benjamin, who stood several inches above him.

“Chowondo Avador,” Taedon nodded, and in return Avador gave a deep bow. “Thank you for assisting in escorting the candidates. This is Allia’s bounty, and part of a ceremony between Dakung and\[ student\] . Might I please request that you give us some time alone.”

Avador nodded, and bowed before turning to retreat back toward the station-like room in the centre of the mountain.

“Go ahead, Hanaata,” he nodded forward to the thin, dark-haired woman who had entered with him.

“Should we, uh, go to a place more private?” Allia asked.

“I don’t believe that will be necessary, Allia,” Taedon replied. Hanaata stepped forward, flashing an awkward smile at the three, reaching her shaking arm out toward them.

“What are you doing?” Billy stepped back from the woman.

“Measuring your capacity, to see your capabilities as Heralds,” the man’s flat eyes traced back to Allia. “Or to see if you are even Heralds at all.”

Allia looked down, her hand curled up into a fist, turning white.

“Reach out your hands, it won’t hurt,” Taedon said to the three. 

Billy backed away, scowling. There was no way anyone was listening to these strange demands.

To his utter surprise, Benjamin proffered his hands out to the dark-haired lady, whose hands looked like a toddler’s in comparison. The lady closed her eyes. Benjamin stood emotionless for a few seconds, and then his eyes grew wide, and there was a slight tremble. 

“A Transportation Herald. He has good potential, but--- nothing *too* astounding. Still, a great prospect,” Hanaata said to Taedon. He didn’t look to her, and instead pointed to Billy.

“You next,” he said.

The woman approached him, and Billy didn’t move. What the cink did she do to Benjamin?

“C’mon,” Taedon said. “Hold out your hands.”

“I don’t think he is a Herald, Dakung,” Allia said.

“I am,” Billy grunted, which actually elicited a brief look of shock, which was replaced thoughtful smile from Allia. “I just don’t want whatever *that* was.”

“Not that bad,” Benjamin said. “Just little prick, in mind.”

Billy grunted, keeping his hands crossed underneath his arms.

“Fine,” Taedon said. “I don’t have time for this. Next.”

A flash of panic washed over Allia’s face, and then she looked to the floor, her lip trembling. Even now, she always had to play a manipulative angle.

Billy was tapped on the shoulder from behind.

“C’mon, Billy,” Damian said. “Wouldn’t you like to know how powerful you are?”

Billy shook his head. “I already know what I’m capable of, I don’t need this---“

He looked into his brother’s pleading eyes. Could it really be that bad?

“Ugh, fine,” Billy said, holding out his hands to the dark-haired woman.

She smiled, closing her eyes again and placing her hands atop Billy’s.

Billy placed his hands lightly ontop of Hanaata’s.  A low rumbling rippled across his body. He could hear her voice in his mind, her thoughts mixing--- overriding his own. Her very essence smothered him in his own mind. Then it was over. All of that, in the blink of an eye. Billy jerked his hand away, cold sweat coalescing on his face. 

“This one has quite the potential. And a Control Herald, too,” Hanaata said.

Allia’s lips formed into a smile, and she was actually smiling at Billy. She quickly looked back to Taedon, whose expression remained an almost hostile stare. He pointed to Damian.

Damian stepped forward, but Billy reached an arm out to block him.

“Whatever you just did, getting into my cinking mind, he doesn’t need any of that. He doesn’t even use his Heraldry anyway,” Billy said. A tiny spark faded from Damian’s eyes.

“Okay,” Taedon said. “We are done here then.”

“Billy,” Benjamin said, pulling him back with a massive hand. “Let Damian go.”

“Urghhh...,” Billy tightened a fist, staring at the boy, who once again had on a child-like plea. “Fine. But if he gets hurt, I swear---“

Billy didn’t have time to finish the sentence, Damian had already stepped forward and had his hands placed underneath Hanaata’s. The dark-haired woman closed her eyes. Several seconds went by, far longer than Benjamin and Billy’s ‘reads’. Damian didn’t shake, like Benjamin had. After even more time had passed, the woman started to frown.

Finally, she released her hands, opening her eyes.

“I-I---there’s nothing,” she said.

“So we have a bunch of liars here. This boy is not a Herald,” Taedon said.

“No, no,” Hanaata interrupted. “Even with commoners, I sense the Aspects, but with him---it was a total blank slate.”

Damian looked with wide eyes to Billy, who simply shrugged. Perhaps this was the best. If they didn’t see him as gifted, then maybe they’d leave him alone, leave his mind unaltered. 

“Well, I don’t know what that means,” said Taedon. “So it’s the same as if was not a Herald. I believe that these candidates are rather underwhelming---“

“They are actually quite strong, from what I felt,” Hanaata said underneath Taedon’s thundering voice.

“---and unfit to join the Tsuman Monastery.”

Allia’s face melted, her jaw dropping. 

“No, no, no, he is a Herald! I saw him use Mind Heraldry! He even tried to use mind control at one point!” Allia shouted, pointing at Damian. 

Taedon raised an eyebrow. 

“Alright, let’s see,” he said to Damian. “Use mind control on Hanaata here.”

Damian scrambled forward, breathing in, and reached out his hand.

Nothing happened.

“It appears this facade is growing weaker as you try to salvage it,” Taedon said to Allia. 

“That’s not fair!” Allia shouted. “It is too bright here, and he is untrained! You can’t expect him to be able to use a power like that here!”

“Kadonsong Allia!” Taedon roared. “You are speaking to your Dakung! Do not raise your voice at me!”

Allia shrinked, her head hanging low.

Billy smirked. Though she was telling the truth, it was fitting that whatever game she was playing had come crashing down on her. He didn’t even want to join this floating Monastery of psychos anyway. The only question on his mind was what him, Benjamin, and Damian would do now?

“Guards,” Taedon said, motioning to the three who guarded the door. “Take them away.”

Billy’s face froze in horror. He instantly reached his arm out to guard Damian, pulling himself and the lad away. Benjamin also backed up with them. 

“I knew it!” He shouted. “I knew this was all *bullshit*! You’ve just flown us to this cinking place to lock us up again, to make us your slaves!”

The guards marched forward, standing in an offensive triangle. 

“You’ll never take us alive!” Billy shouted. He threw the words with visceral force towards Allia, whose lip was quivering. Were those tears in her eyes?

“Allia,” it appeared like Taedon was trying to whisper privately to Allia, although Billy could easily hear his booming voice. “Tell them to stand down, or we will have to dispose of them.”

Allia turned to them, and yes, there were tears in her eyes. Billy had to shake his head to remind himself that this was a killer, a manipulator, a stone-cold animal. What kind of weird angle she was playing with even the members of her own psychotic Monastery, Billy had no idea.

“Stand down, please,” Allia said, her lip quivering as she spoke the words. “I’m sorry.”

Billy tightened his stance further. The three guards inched forward, hardening their fists.

Once again, to his surprise, Benjamin stepped forward, hands over his head.

“What are you doing, Benjamin!?” Billy screamed. “I never thought you were a coward! You’d abandon Damian and I?”

“I suggest you do same. How do we get off flying cinking island?” Benjamin asked rhetorically. 

Billy grinded his teeth, quickly moving back into a battle-ready stance.

To his dismay, Damian had stepped forward next to him, surrendered in the same position as Benjamin.

“Damian---“

The guards quickly surrounded the two surrendered men, grabbing their limp arms and forcing them behind their backs.

Damian’s eyes and lips looked like a child who had just done something he promised he wouldn’t, and Billy fell out of his defensive stance, though the flames of anger still burned inside.

“I suggest you take a note from your friends and surrender,” the final guard said, advancing on Billy’s position.

Billy clenched his fist next to his empty holster, glaring at the man, flashing his teeth like a wild wolf.

Finally, he relented, relaxing his body and allowing the bootlickers to subdue him.

The final guard wrestled Billy’s arms behind his back, and the three bootlickers faced Taedon, having secured the three prisoners. Arftul Allia stood next to her supposed master, still maintaining that illusory puppy-dog\[ 2021-04-03, 9:15 AM

Perhaps change if we come up with a unique animal\] face.

Billy stopped, taking his time to pierce through that faux waterfall in her eyes. He would have her know that while he didn’t understand it, he saw through her manipulation. Why hadn’t he trusted his gut when it came to her?

Sure enough, she maintained the facade. 

“I---“

“I knew it,” Billy interrupted her before she could eject any more of that deceiving bile. “I have no idea why you do what you do, but then I again I usually don’t understand people like you, literally living on a flying island, thinking that it’s your right to manipulate those that you think lower than yourselves.”

Allia just looked to the floor, and a drop of water fell from her eye. 

“Get them to the holding cell already,” Taedon said, his eyes not even glossing over Billy. “We have much to talk about, Allia.”

Billy pictured himself kicking the guard’s shin, slowing time, and then punching that smug old bastard. But he couldn’t. He’d have to be around to protect Damian in the coming days, and at least give his brother a chance of escape.

The guard pushed him forward to follow Benjamin and Damian, and Billy obliged, but kept an ear on the two schemers. Maybe he could find out what their game plan was, and how to circumvent it.

“Dakung, why *again*?” It was Allia’s voice. “I made *sure*, these ones didn’t have the same issues as the ones I brought before. I’m not sure about the Control Herald, but I know the other two are good Heralds!”

*So this is some kind of recurring scheme? She doesn’t even have the care to use my real name, of course, ‘cause she just sees me as a resource to exploit!*

“You heard, Hanaata says they all have good potential! Please, you have to reconsider!” She continued shouting.

Billy instantly turned his neck to look back at Allia and Taedon. The young Light Herald stood in front of her master, and though his expression was fuzzy, he definitely didn’t appear pleased, with those thick, narrowed eyebrows.

She *was* arguing against him, in favour of freeing them. But then again, maybe she *wanted* Billy to hear, so he wouldn’t suspect her. 

“Quiet down, Allia,” Taedon said, and Billy couldn’t hear the rest.

What were these people planning? 

“Keep going,” the guard behind him grunted, pushing him forward.

Billy turned his head and kept walking, walking to yet another prison.
