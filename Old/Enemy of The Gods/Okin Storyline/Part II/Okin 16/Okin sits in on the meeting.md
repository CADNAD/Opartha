Okin had never actually been upstairs in Aldwin’s manor before, and tried to resist his urge in looking around too much.

He followed close behind the other masked man in an attempt to look like he knew what he was doing. 

The other man walked through an open doorway at the end of the carpeted hall.

Inside the room, Aldwin and the two other masked men were waiting, standing next to each other against the wall.

It must’ve been Aldwin’s study, judging by the row of bookshelves that made up the walls and the tall, mahogany office desk in the middle. 

The masked man nodded to Aldwin before lining up next to one of the other masked men with his back to the wall. Okin instinctually did the same, and lined up next to that man, forming a small arc in the room.

Okin didn’t notice that there were already men behind him. Before long, men with identical black masks, some wearing black robes like his and other wearing Ather’s robes lined the walls of the study until a perfect circle was formed.

Aldwin nodded at one of the men at the far edge of the circle, and the man reached over and closed the double doors, sealing the office room with a *click.*

Aldwin waited for him to rejoin the circle. With a defiant step he stepped forward toward the desk in the centre. He took out a small key and unlocked a cabinet attached to the bottom of the desk.

He pulled it open and grabbed a black mask with a beak--- though this one was longer and much more detailed than the others. Unlike the others, it appeared to be encapsulated with real feathers. When Aldwin put it on, he appeared to almost be a humanoid raven.

“Hello, my friends. Thank you for coming,” Aldwin said, in a voice a little deeper and sharper than Okin was used to. “I know this meeting is a little untraditional, but as you all know we have very urgent matters at hand and must do whatever we can to gather in a secure environment.”

Aldwin stood up taller and looked around the room. Okin forced himself to remember that to Aldwin, he looked just like the other men in this room; his identity was incomprehensible. Still, it was hard to keep from shaking, so he crept his hands behind his back.

“Our plan falling into place,” Aldwin continued. “Those who we thought may be a problem have are seemingly a non-issue, and only a few minor roadblocks are standing in the way of our vision.”

“What about your son, Aldwin?” a man two to the right of Aldwin spoke with a gruff, deep voice.

“Yes, that was one of the roadblocks I was to speak of. It is a temporary one, though, as they all are. He will be on our side, but right now I am not sure that he is ready. He showed some promise--- and much more inquisitiveness than usual--- but I am worried that he does not understand the importance of our... discretion.”

The same heckler stepped forward. Okin could just make out the top of his head, which was extremely white yet strong; it fit well, the man’s voice sounded old yet powerful.

“Well, that sounds like it may be more than just a *temporary roadblock*, seeing how much we are banking on him and this election.

“I was always against this idea,” the white-haired man sighed. “My harbinger, are you *sure* that this is the right course of action?”

Okin leaned in. To be frank, *he* had had the same concerns and would have sided with the heckler, but at the same time, he kind of *wanted* this cult to be putting their eggs into a rickety basket. It just didn’t make much sense from *Aldwin’s* perspective.

Aldwin stepped forward. Though his eyes were hidden by the mask, his glare was clear. 

“I have already made it clear that this is the will of Our God,” Aldwin blared. 

*Our* *God?* Okin thought. *Does he mean Aredal, or...*

“We can control and use officials without giving them all of our secrets. Olitheon knows we’ve done it before,” another man with a sharp voice spoke up.

Yes, I quite agree with that mindset for the moment. Eventually, though, Previa will join us. He is my son, after all.”

There was an awkward pause, and Aldwin stepped back into his place in the circle. His posture relaxed. The elder man leaned forward and looked at him with a raised hand, and Aldwin gave him an affirmative nod.

“I understand, harbinger. But I am still worried about him being influenced by others... outside of our control. He is a good friend of that other rebellious Ather, is he not?”

“Okin and Previa knew each other as children, but I have kept them both under my watch. I ensure you that Previa is well under my control and that he knows nothing that we haven’t directly fed to him.”

Another cult member with a dumber voice stepped forward. 

“I thought we sent Marino\[ 2022-01-08, 6:11 PM

Assassin\] to deal with that other Ather? What---” 

“*His* name is *Okin*,” Aldwin barked, cutting off the man, who shuddered back into place. “And I---I do believe he has been dealt with,” the Impalias’ voice quieted.

Okin narrowed his eyebrows. Part of him was furious at Aldwin for... well, admitting to ordering Okin’s death, but he could also hear a tinge of sadness in the Impalias’ voice. It seemed to him like maybe these other cult members had cornered Aldwin into making this decision.

Aldwin was eyeing all the cult members now though as he spoke. It was probably just usual business for a leader, but it still made Okin nervous. He took a step back as to not bring too much attention to himself. 

After it was clear Aldwin had finished, the white-haired man stepped forward.

“Has anyone heard from Marino?” 

“No, but I know Okin well,” Aldwin responded. “His Rothar’s reported there’s been no trace of him since we sent Marino to eliminate him, and he’s not the type to... stay in the shadows.”

Okin’s jaw tensed. He slinked backwards, until he felt something against the bookshelf wall against the back of his wrist.

“Surely Marino would report back immediately after eliminating the target,” the white-haired man said. “Perhaps we should be worried.”

Okin was caught by something of unusual colour in the corner of his eye. He stood up a bit taller. It was something dark purple, coming from the open drawer on the bottom of Aldwin’s desk.

“He’s probably just run into some complications. Marino is an excellent tracker, and especially without his Rothar, Okin is...,” Aldwin took a pause, and his voice quieted.

“Hopeless against him.”

Okin’s eyes immediately moved from whatever was inside Aldwin’s desk to the Impalias himself. 

A strange sense of pride, anger, despair, and sadness came over him. Ironically, he felt this strange feeling from both the situation and Aldwin’s voice.

“Enough about my son and my... that Ather. I have both those situations under control,” Aldwin said. “We must focus on ensuring the success of our plan. Is High Ather Casno here?”

A tall man, much lankier than the rest, stepped forward.

“I am here, my harbinger,” he said in a rather squeaky voice.

“Good. Tell me, does it seem like we can count on Impalias Torridin’s vote?”

The man shrugged.

“Torridin, as usual, is indecisive and conforming. He will likely go with whichever side is already advantaged, as to not start a conflict,” he said.

“Well, it seems that it is all upon the shoulders of your son,” a stout cult member said to Aldwin.

“Well,” Aldwin stepped back. “It is on the shoulders of *us* to get him there.”

“Now... Arten,” Aldwin looked over the circle, and a slender man with short grey hair raised his hand. “How many of the representatives have you gotten on your side?”

“I’m not sure. I mailed out letters to the ones we couldn’t find in case they are still in their home towns, and I only got back one confirmation. I’ve talked to several in person and about five or six have told me I could count on their vote, but I don’t know about the rest,” the elderly man, Arten, replied.

*Arten?* Okin thought. High Ather Arten was one of the other candidates running for Impalias in the Southern Whenrani\[ 2022-01-22, 3:05 PM

check\] district for this election. 

*And they are controlling him...* 

Okin’s eyes fell back to the dark object that was in the drawer of Aldwin’s desk. It wasn’t bigger than two thumbs, and it was a dark purple in hue. It looked sharp, like a---

*Space Crystal?*

“Well, ask them exactly what they want, and give them false promises! It’s not like you’re going to actually ever have to fulfill them,” Aldwin said.

Okin scowled. He’d tried to remember any time he had heard Aldwin sound so manipulative before, but all the images that popped into his head were memories of a kind, understanding man. He’d never heard Aldwin be so cynical about Versalism and The Citadel before, and the systems he had in place. In fact, he used to think of Aldwin as a *stickler* for some of these traditions, even some of the ones Okin had to search through the *Onorun* to really understand their meeting.

But then again, what could he expect from a man who appeared to have been lying to him his entire life?

“Yes, of course, my harbinger,” the elderly man stepped back into his place in the circle.

Okin looked back down to the purple gem in the back of Aldwin’s cupboard. Yes, it definitely did resemble a Space Crystal.

But... why? Why would Aldwin be harbouring a Space Crystal? 

*Could he*... *could he possibly have been a Herald* all this time?

“Good,” Aldwin stepped out from behind the desk. He slowly walked toward the middle of the circle as he talked. “It is unfortunate that we have so little time today. The main reason I have called you all here is to officially announce that the main stage of our great plan must commence. We must change people’s mind about the issues which will determine the success of our great plan.”

Aldwin paused in the middle and turned to look around the circle of masked men. 

“Slowly but surely insert our goals into your proselytizing. Vassani, it is time to release the false dissidents.”

A shorter man bowed forward. Okin’s eyes widened. 

*Vassani?* Impalias *Vassani?*  Okin thought.

“Yes, my harbinger,” the older man said.

“Yes,” Aldwin raised a hand to his side. “The time is upon us. We must enact the will of our god. We all have a place in his plan for salvation. We are all separate tools, but we must act as one. Remember: he sees all, he guides all.”

“Aventa,” the men said in unison. Okin stood in shock. Well, they were still using the common mantra of faith that Versalists across the world used. At least--- at least that pointed in the direction that they weren’t *Anti-*Versalist. Okin half expected them to use some sort of niche cult language he’d never heard of, but they seemed to be entirely speaking in Trentanian unless they were using the classical Versalist Terridian terminologies. 

Yet... Our God? Of course, that could refer to one of the Four, but Aldwin was a Dedicant of Aredal, and some of the men were wearing robes of Intillia, Nexon, and Olitheon. Of course, *all* of the Gods were the Gods of humanity, but they were Our God*s,* plural. Was Aldwin just referring to *one* of the Gods and a specific aspect of Dedication or was this some sort of monotheistic cult?

Aldwin rolled his sleeves up a bit and glanced down at a golden watch on his wrist. 

“There is little time left, and we cannot risk the other partygoers hearing us. The crucial matter has been dealt with. You,” Aldwin slid his finger over three or four Athers on the left side of the circle. “When we get downstairs, you will all leave around five minutes after we start the activities, separately. You,” Aldwin pointed over the next three. “You leave around five minutes after we *finish* the activities. The rest of you, do not leave until twenty minutes after we have finished the activities.”

“Yes, my harbinger,” the room echoed. 

*Twenty minutes?* Okin felt nervous about waiting along and making conversation while Aldwin’s party guests dwindled that long. *Would he even notice if I snuck out first?*

“Good. I hear chatter downstairs, the other groups have dispersed from their activities. Let us go.” 

Aldwin stepped out from behind the desk and marched out of the room, quickly followed by the men on the left side of the room, opposite from Okin. Most of the others on the left side closest to the door piled in too, though the two men closest to the desk next to Okin were walking behind the desk along the circle, waiting behind the  left side to exit.

However, Okin’s eye was once again caught by the slight sliver dark amethyst gem peeking out of the drawer of Aldwin’s desk.

Okin glanced to the men leaving through the door. They were all piling through like sardines, especially the ones that had been on his right. A few waited behind the other men lined up on the left, just in front of the desk. None looked at him or the desk.

He walked by at the most casual pace he could feign, sliding his hand back and forth as to make a raise of the hand look natural. He leaned to his right as he slid by the desk, and his eyes darted back around to the masked men.

*Their eyes are invisible--- but their heads seemed turned enough---*

Okin slid the desk just a tiny bit more open until the dark gem was fully in view. With swift precision, he thrust his shoulder slightly forward as he grabbed it between two fingers as to look like he was still walking. He took a stride, and once back on his right leg moved his thigh just to the right as to gently shut the drawer closed once again.

He curled up his fist and felt the jagged ends of the crystal dig into his palm. He didn’t dare look down at it. He only dare join the line of dark-beaked men as they piled out of the room.

Last to leave Aldwin’s study, he turned to shut the twin doors. Hopefully no one would question how he inconveniently used his left hand twice to close one after the other.
