# The Leviathi (Liquid, Teleporation)
The Leviathi is a massive serpentine creature that lives in The Leviathi Strait, from where the Strait got its namesake, although this is a little known fact in the modern world. The Leviathi brings terrible waves wherever it goes, as it has control over water, and obviously properties of Liquid Heraldry. Legends say that it will instantly meet anyone who sails the Leviathi Strait, a property of its Teleportation Heraldry.

# The Dreamstalker aka *Yon Mikuur* (Mind, Teleportation)
The Dreamstalker is somewhat of an urban legend that is told to scare children into good behavior, stating that the dreamstalker will haunt the dreams of those who have secret lies and "feed on them in their sleep". The exact nature of the feeding differs from telling to telling, from as innocent as feeding on the lies, to as dark as feeding on the children's bodies, minds, and soul, in repetitive terror that is inescapable and leads to extreme insomnia. 

Unfortunately, the dreamstalker is very real and haunts dreams of all ages-- he has properties of Teleportation and Dark Heraldry, and teleports into homes and preys on the mind of the sleeping. He does more oft target children as their dreams are more vivid and their minds more fragile. The Dreamstalker is shown to be quite intelligent, althought he is actually less intelligent than it may seem as he is often just reflecting people's fears, which are already often verbalized in their mind, back to them. The Dreamstalker actually gets its nutrtition from feeding off dreams.

# The Hivemind (Mind)
A dark herald legendary beast, which is a hive mind. Presents itself as coral polyps. Can be planted, but only survives in dessert climates. People can access upload or download memories by touching it, or by connecting to a polyp through shadow. People connected by shadow to a specific node are able to communicate telepathically. The larger the plant the more memories it can hold. People garden the roots out wards to be able to maintain connections at all times. As the roots grow, the middle polyp grows larger. Uploads and downloads only occur at the polyp itself.

# The Storm Dragon aka *Hongya hong tong tongei* (Transportation, Gas, Light)
The Storm Dragon is a massive slitherine flying dragon, similar to smaller Hong Tongeis in the & region. Like regular Hong Tongeis, the Storm Dragon has properties of transportation Heraldry, as its "flying" is more like "floating", which is quite obvious by the way it moves, sliterhing in the sky like a true snake, but able to move vertically with ease. 

Many tribal legends say that the Storm Dragon is the father and creator of the other Hong Tongeis, however, that is unknown.

# The Zombie Horde (Mind, Teleportation)
A virus which has caused a zombie apocalypse among mammals and other larger animals in Vianarya and Caspo. The zombies also let out a mating call of sorts, which causes other zombies to teleport to it...

# The World Maker aka *Kariqibu* (Solid, Liquid)
A truly gargantuan, boar-like creature, which wanders in the empty plains of Farsun, consuming wildlife and fauna and leaving desert behind. However, it can reform the world and occassionally creates beautiful biomes (though they do come out of its ass).

# The Bestiary aka *Multigraven* (Creation, Subject)
No one knows the true form of the Bestiary-- few live to even see it twice, much less make the inference that it is in fact a shapeshifter which has recorded the biology of any creature it has killed, and even suitable combinations of them, and can transform into any of them at will.

# The Destiny Serpent aka *Sung Nang Di* (Object, Mind)
The Destiny Serpent is a small snake which rebirths itself instead of reproducing. Legends say that if it bites you, it will tell you your future, however some have claimed that its predictions did not come true. It really works by viewing an alternate timeline that is currently ahead of yours.

# The Weather Scale aka *Ledoulle* (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Light)
A truly gargantuan beast which resembles a combination between a tortoise and a sea serpent, with mole claws. The material of its body changes based on its mood, and also affects the surroundings significantly. Here are some of its recorded moods and their effects:

1. Anger - Lava, Volcanic
2. Calm - Lake, Wet
3. Depressed or Lacking Sunlight - Stone
4. Anxious - Sand, Low Winds
5. Joyful - Grass, Foliage
6. Free - Flying, Clouds, High Winds

# The Continent Bird aka *Tneratos* aka *Tehwa Kanura* (Solid, Gas, Transporation)

\-6 middle Spikes:

\-Banuro: Admin and Storage

\-Two for housing

\-One for library/market

\-One for training

\-One for engineering, woodwork, experiments etc

The Tneranotos \[*Nur-an-o-toss*\], also known as the *Tehwa Kanura* by its inhabitants, is a massive, flying reptile with a wingspan of several miles. It has dark red skin, which appears very veiny along its wings. It’s body is thin and long, and its underbelly, while solid, vulnerable compared to its topside, which is covered in rocky spikes that are functionally similar to small mountains. 

Many of its inhabitants believe that the creature has Gas, Solid, and Transportation Heraldic properties, as it is made of a very heavy stone like-material which is similar to both rock and dirt; yet it is able to lift itself up effortlessly an also attract people to it with a gravity-like force. It also seems to push cold air downwards and warm air upwards, which makes its back warm enough for habitation even high in the atmosphere.
The inhabitants of the Tneranotos are a religious cult known as the Tsuman Monastery, a radical cult which does not leave the Tneratos. They have a symbiotic relationship with the beast, and ensure its civility with a large team of Mind Heralds, constantly working to sooth and influence it. In return, they often hunt birds that will claw at the beast’s back, and sometimes even feed it.

The Tneranatos also has six massive large rock spikes on its back, which the Monastery has taken to making temples, housing, and important buildings inside. They also often farm and hunt animals on the Tneranatos' back, which has a very healthy ecosystem.

The Tneranotos also has a predictable migration pattern, which has been memorized and harnessed by members of the Monastery. It is unknown whether anyone outside their ranks has knowledge of its migration behaviour. The members of the Monastery are known to utilize and live inside the large rock spikes of the Tneranotos, and have terraformed much of its back. Whether through soothing or a lack of nerves, the Tneranotos appears indifferent or even welcoming to their activity.

# The Great Watcher (Teleportation)
A size-changing raven-like bird with a light grey beak. It has high intelligence and uses its stealth and abilities to watch over humanity. It has decided to “assist” humanity instead of rejecting, attacking, or merely attempting to stay away from it. However, it sees humanity as a long project of sorts and is not afraid to kill if it means preserving the human race. However, it is very cautious and understands that revealing its nature and abilities unnecessarily may be dangerous, and thus intervenes conservatively. Recently it has “teamed up” with Revictus to prevent Tregale from returning. 

Once, a high-ranking member of Revictus’ order discovered The Great Watcher communing with Revictus in secret, and Revictus and The Great Watcher realized they couldn’t completely keep their relationship secret entirely anymore. As such, Revictus commanded that the order “worship” TGW, and presented him as a wise and quasi-all-knowing messenger of the Gods who was sent to protect humanity. From that day forward, the order designed masks that resembled the face and beak of The Great Watcher.
