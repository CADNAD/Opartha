Okin started loose, careless steps down the stone path from Aldwin’s manor to the open street. He peered up at the vast, empty sky as his fingers brushed ever so gently across the top of squarely-cut garden bushes; the prickly tops created a tickling, even pleasurable feeling when they were touched upon so shallowly. But of course he knew, without even looking, that venturing any deeper would cut his flesh and cause great pain.

He paused and looked down at his those fingertips which hovered just above the cut of the bushes. They shook now, and with every tremble would he would get that little painless prick. 

Something within him snapped. His index finger jerked too fast and he felt a stab. The sharp edge of a trimmed leaf had pierced his skin.

Then, every muscle in his body stopped moving. He didn’t scream, or even flinch. He simply moved the cut finger up to his eye level so he could watch a thin drop of blood fall from it to the ground. And all around him was a blur, except for his bright finger and the dark line of blood drolling from its tip.

“Hey!” A high-pitched voice brought everything back into focus. Okin jerked his head to find Previa’s bright emerald eyes shining at him.

The Ather held a couple baskets, holding them close to his Ather’s robes to stop vegetables and bread from falling from them. “What great luck that you’re here, Okin! I was actually just coming by to tell you something important after dropping off this food and getting another lecture from father about which Athers and Devinars that I can sway.”

Okin tucked his bleeding finger into his hand and lowered it behind his back. 

“W-what did you want to tell me?” His throat shook with every word.

“My father,” Previa’s childlike smile glowed under the rays of the sun. 

“He told me it’s real, Okin. What you asked me--- the Fourth Book of Nexon is real.”
