“Lionos!  Lionos!”  Hurried knocking came from behind the white double doors.  Billy looked up from the chessboard to the door, as his a tall man got up from the opposite side of it, moving towards the door.  From the floor, Billy couldn’t even see the man’s face. 

The man turned his hand and there was a steely click, and swung open the left side door. The sound of deafening rain poured into the house.

In the doorway, a slender woman held a something in her arms. Her face was blocked by the man’s body, but Billy could see the ends of her drenched hair. He crawled to the side to get a better view. It was a toddler, a boy, as a newborn babe. He had little hair, and dark, large eyes.

“Jiana! What are you doing out?  I thought you were asleep!" the man shouted.  “And who is this?”

“I was feeling sick and wanted some tea, but we were out.  So I went along to the tea shop---“

“The tea shop is closed at this hour, as always," the man, Lionos, replied.

“I know, I wasn’t thinking straight.  Of course, when I got there, the store was closed and the door was shut, and then my headache just worsened.  And then I thought I heard a faint scream---”

“Why would you chase after a scream in the middle of the night?” The man sputtered.

“It sounded like a young child.  I ran towards the sound, which sounded like it was coming from the forest, and then I found this little boy, all alone, crying," the woman coddled the toddler.

The man stood in the doorway, flabbergasted. “Well, come inside.”

Jiana looked to Lionos with pleading eyes, as Lionos shut the door behind them.  “We have to take him in. This child doesn’t have anywhere else to go,” she pleaded.

Looking at the child with bewilderment, the man took a deep breath. He turned, and then kneeled down to Billy’s level, looking down with kind, olive eyes.

“What do you think, Billy? Do you want to have a baby brother?”

Billy looked from his father’s clownish grin to the wide, shining dark eyes of the baby. They stared at him from his mother’s arms with an innocent plea.
