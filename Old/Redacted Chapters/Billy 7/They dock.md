As Billy emerged from the lower deck--- where he had slept away the time since Damian alerted him in a drunk stupor--- onto the main deck he shielded his eyes. Slowly adjusting, he found himself in a foreign yet familiar land. Several ships were docked to either side of them, wooden piers extending towards the stone seawall. There was open space between the seawall and the building fronts where boxes were stacked and carts ran in a frantic manner. Most of the buildings here were two to three stories, with sloping, tiled pagoda-styled roofs coloured a deep aquamarine that hung over the sides and curbed back up in a subtle wave. A serpertine spine ran along the middle and framed the front and back side, slightly thicker than the overhang. Billy had seen these Marthian style roofs in old sketches his father had brought home from the sailors. That explained the eastern tinge to Allia’s accent. 

As the boat was tied to the pie,  a group of dockhands and a man in a more regal outfit approached. He had some sort of robe, tied with a knotted belt at the waist, so that the intricate knot faced forward. While the bottom of the cloak was a pure white, hints of green lined the edges of his outfit and at the deep V cut of his collar. Underneath the robe he seemed to wear an equally white undergarment which covered up any skin that may have been showing on the chest. On his head, he wore a black, wide brimmed hat which rose up a good foot or so above his head. Under his chin, a black strap wrapped tightly to hold the thing in place. He looked a little over forty, at least based on his greying beard and wrinkled face. Square and scarred, Billy had seen his type in most of his former bosses. Old men who knew violence all too well.

Immediately the man yelled out to Allia, and the girl obeyed. Walking across the deck she still seemed to move in that ephemeral way--- too still and too silent. But something about her had changed. The uniform seemed less tight, less fitting than before. Rather, she looked like a girl playing dress up in her father’s wardrobe. Allia stopped at the edge of the boat, waiting a moment for the gangplank to be put down. She shied away from the man, eyes darting around the ground at her feet. 

“Kadonsong Allia,” the man said. 

Allia looked up and spoke back in quiet voice, “Chowondo Avador.”

“It is you, ain’t it?”

Allia have a small nod as the two met eyes. “Let me see it then, you know I need proof.” 

“Of course Chowondo,” Allia bowed her head deeply, before taking the pin out of her hair. She gripped it between her thumb and index and proffered it to the man. He hesitated for a moment, taking a deep inhalation before grabbing it the same way Allia had. The two seemed to tense up for a moment as they both mouthed a phrase in a language Billy couldn’t parse. After they had finished, they held the pose for a few seconds longer before the man released his grip. 

“Ever eventful with you, kid,” the man seemed to smile before glancing to Damian, Benjamin, and Billy on the opposite side of the deck. 

“Are those---”

“Yes,” Allia said quickly, cutting the man off. Cutting him off because of what he might have said? *It seem that secrets know no bounds around this girl*, Billy thought. 

“They will see the Dakungs immediately,” she said. 

A look of amusement seemed to cross the man, “Right now? Forces gift you kid, the Dakungs might like you, but that don’t\[ 2021-01-17, 8:48 AM

Where is this guy from? I just want to make sure the speech quirks are consistent\] mean they’re just gonna let you have an audience with them immediately.” 

Allia grabbed his arm forcibly and pulled the man in close, “Please. I need them to speak with the Dakungs.” She leaned her head against his shoulder and seemed to mumble another quieter plea. 

The man allowed her to rest her head before slipping his arm deftly away. “We’ll go right now then, and we’ll see what they say. By the forces, you’re not a little girl anymore, you can’t keep doing this.” 

“Then stop allowing it to work,” she said with a smile. An actual smile. Not the feral, demented one she had given after killing that Devinar, or the sarcastic ones she had given while breaking them out of jail. An actual genuine smile. 

“Come now,” Allia took a step towards the three and gestured them over. “I know you all crave answers.” 

Benjamin pushed himself off the wall and Damian followed after the older one. “You really with her, Benjy?” Billy asked.

“Girl’s give way out, seem smart to listen,” he said. 

“Don’t it seem *too* good, though?” Billy raised an eyebrow.

Benjamin nodded a little, “not made deal yet, we can still say no.” 

Billy was shocked that his friend barely acknowledged the suspiciousness of this strange circumstances. Honesty in the deal was one of the first things he had learned in Apathasaw. Allia was violating this tenant, and Benjamin gave little to no pushback.

*What did that girl do to you, buddy?*
