Liu examined the interior of the academy’s lobby. It was far more ornate than any room he had ever been, especially considering the fact that there wasn’t any obvious purpose to its extravagance. Beautiful framed paintings of the Nihda mountains, the Leviathi Strait, and what Liu assumed to be Delmian lakes hung in a pleasing composition. At the corners sat potted plants, the painted pots arguably more the focus than the plants themselves. Even the floor was leagues above what Liu was used to, beautifully tessellated and polished wood. 

The only thing that wasn’t completely decorative was a wiry man with round spectacles hunched over a hardwood desk. Looking up from his papers at Shi and Liu, he smiled meekly.

“Hello, welcome to the Delmian State Academy for Military Officials! How may I help you?” The thin man said.

“Hello, my name is Inspector Shi An of The Ministry of Works, and this here is my good friend Liu. He’d like to join the academy.”

The secretary nodded, eyeing Liu’s bruised face, and then looking away as soon as Liu’s eyes met his. “A pleasure, Inspector Shi. Does Liu have any Imperial identification?”

“No, he does not,” Shi said.

“Now does Liu have any prior formal training or education?” 

“No,” Shi said. 

The clerk scribbled with his inked feather and then looked back up at the two men. “And I assume he is a native Delmian?”

“That is correct,” Shi replied.

Liu shivered. A unregistered Delmian without any prior training? Not exactly a shining candidate. Still, he remembered how desperate Shi made the academy sound.

“And do you have residence here in Kazon-Tsuh?”

“No,” Liu replied.

“And has Liu here ever exhibited any signs of Heraldry?” The skinny man asked.

Shi looked to Liu, who shook his head. “No,” Shi stated.

“And if accepted, when and where would you be looking to begin your education?

Shi looked to Liu for an answer, but the Delmian boy paused, taking time to think. He knew he wanted to begin as soon as possible, but he hadn’t considered the fact of where. Since Delmia was now officially part of the Empire, Liu could technically serve in the Imperial army or the Delmian State army, or even emigrate to Feixiang or Beisan or any of the other Imperial provinces and serve under their state armies. 

“I’d like to start my training as soon as possible, and I’ll either serve under the Imperial army, or the Delmian State army.”

The secretary stared back at Liu. “It is likely you’ll serve in the Delmian State army?”

“Yes,” Liu said.

Scribbling down some last notes on the page, the clerk smiled at the two men. “Well, congratulations, Mr. Liu. You have been accepted to the Delmian State Academy for Military Officials. Your training will begin as soon as we get you settled and get you an Imperial identification,” the man smiled at Liu and Shi. “And the payment is...,” the secretary opened a desk drawer and pulled out a sheet of paper, examining it, “One thousand four hundred Imperial Zhens for the year, or seven hundred fifty for the first six months.” The annual amount was one-hundred less than Shi’s estimation, unless if they wanted to pay in two deposits. 

“We’ll be paying for the full year, and you also accept Delmian Sankei, I assume?”

“Yes, we do,” the clerk replied. “That would be, uh...”

“One-hundred eighty Gold Sankei,” Liu interjected.

“Yes,” the wiry man said.

Shi opened the bag of Delmian coins and counted out a handful, placing those inside the second satchel. He then handed the bag to the clerk. “There should be ninety Gold Sankei in that bag,” Shi then fiddled through the satchel, pulling out some paper bills and counting them in his hand, before placing a wad on the table. “And that is seven-hundred Zhen.” 

The thin man quickly counted out the coins, stacking them into groups of ten, which there were nine of. There were also four silver Sankei that had been in the pile, which the clerk handed back to Shi. He fanned out the paper bills, and then smiled with an affirmative nod. 

“Looks like everything is in order. Welcome to the academy. I will show you to the Director if you are ready.” 

“Thank you,” Liu said, before turning to Shi. “And thank you very much, Inspector Shi. I believe I will be very successful at this career path, and it would not be possible without your sponsorship.”

Shi smiled, and took an arm around Liu, turning him away from the desk. “If you’ll just give us a minute, I’d like to say some words to my friend before I depart,” Shi said to the secretary, who nodded with a smile. 

Bringing Liu to a corner of the room where their voices wouldn’t be heard by the secretary, Shi peered down to Liu. “I am more than happy to sponsor you Liu, and I believe that you will go very far. But you must focus very hard, and always put forward that burning determination that I know you have.” Liu nodded, looking up to the taller man. 

“Have you ever been to a Delmian Akano, Liu?” The inspector asked.

“No, I have not, but I am familiar with the tradition of horse sprinting,” Liu replied.

Shi solidified his gaze. “Well, you are like my prize horse, Liu. You are the star of the show, and I support and train you, but if you fail--- well then you make me lose a lot of money, and worse, you make me look very bad. And bad things come to horses who disappoint their owners.”

Liu looked back to Shi, unfazed. “So your success depends on mine? I don’t see how that could be possible.”

Shi shook his head. “I don’t think you fully understand my analogy. There will be other horses here, Liu, and you have to beat them. Don’t make me regret my investment.”

Liu looked confusedly at Shi. “Okay, Mr. Shi. I will try.”

“Trying is not good enough. You must beat them,” he replied, inches away from Liu’s face. 

Shi turned away from the young Delmian, smiling to the secretary. 

“I believe the boy is ready,” he said, before he turned for the door, his tunic flaring.

The secretary gave a toothy smile, standing up to face Liu. 

“Come, let us go speak with the director, and then we’ll get you to your room,” the man motioned for Liu to walk with him, and Liu followed. The director’s office was just to the right of the main lobby, and the secretary gave a knock on the door.

“Who is it?” A booming voice barked from inside the office. 

“It’s Inlo. We have a new recruit, sir,” the skinny man replied. 

The door swung open, revealing a tall, broad-shouldered man with a thick moustache. He looked down to Liu, who stood behind the secretary. 

“What’s he looking to become?” The director asked.

“An officer of the Delmian State army, I believe,” the secretary replied.

“Or Imperial,” Liu said.

The man’s moustache curved upwards. “Ah, Delmian State! That’s wonderful. We don’t need any more spineless wimps looking to get a salary sitting around doing training drills in Feixiang. If you’re going to train here, serve here. I like it.”

Liu gave a weak nod at the man’s bombastic enthusiasm.

“Well, get him settled with Commander Iri. He doesn’t have too many trainees on his hands at the moment, and he’s an excellent leader.”

The director gave the clerk a forceful pat on the shoulder, before slamming the door shut in his face. “All right, why don’t we go settle you with Commander Iri, then,” the secretary said, already beginning to walk out of the lobby, with Liu trailing behind.
