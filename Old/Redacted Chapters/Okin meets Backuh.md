The market was bustling.  Brightly coloured tents stood over wooden stands and tables of all sizes, and some merchants were even selling goods from the windows of their houses. The dirt-faced, rag-clothed children popped against the shining armour of Rothars and Devinars, and the golden collars of the other Athers.  There were strange small gatherings, families listened to a preaching Ather while intermittently buying fabrics, furniture, and foodstuffs.

*I’ve heard some say that The Citadel holds a third of all the Rothars in Wreathward.  While that just seems impractical, there’s certainly enough space, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen this many before,* Okin thought.

“The Citadel actually has some brilliant cuisine,” Previa said, as they passed in front of a stand which hung several large butchered animals. “You should try the Oxen.”

“I’ll just have a loaf of bread or two,” Okin said.  

“Are you sure?”  Previa asked.  “If you’re worried about spending, I’ve got you covered.”

Okin smiled, and shook his head.  “Thank you Previa, but I’ll just get some bread, and pay for myself.”

Okin approached a stand which displayed several baskets of bread and pastries, and leaned in to speak to the merchant. Still, the man had to tilt his ear towards the Ather to hear above the loud cheers of children and rabble of other customers.  

“How much for a loaf of bread?” Okin asked.

“Three steltells!” The man shouted.

Okin handed the man three of the nickel coins, and chose a slice of bread.

“Thank you!” Okin shouted.

“So that’s all you’re getting?” Previa asked as he and Okin left the epicentre of the marketplace.

“That’s all,” Okin said.  “You have to go back to your father now, I’m guessing?”

Previa let out a deep sigh.  “Unfortunately,” his giddy expression quickly returned.  “I hope you can find your way back,” he joked.

Okin smiled, and then waved his friend goodbye.  

Okin wandered back towards the visitor complex.  He would be staying there at least for the night, and maybe the next day, Aldwin gave him that much leeway.  He hadn’t even thought that far ahead.

*Why would Aldwin not want to track down Billy?*  Aldwin knew Lionel personally--- Okin still remembered him mourning on that fateful day, five years ago.  And what was even more strange was Aldwin’s stern insistence for Okin to stay silent. Perhaps that was connected to his third strange decision--- to encourage Previa to run as Impalias.  Previa was good-natured and kind, but he knew little more than the average man about the actual tenants of Versalism--- in fact, he probably knew less than some who he ‘preached’ to. In Okin’s opinion, his friend shouldn’t even have became an Ather--- but an Impalias, one of the ten who advises The Mouth of the Gods, who leads all of Moden Versalism, who serves the Four to the highest degree? That would be utter madness.

Aldwin’s decisions were more than troubling, but Okin had known the man since childhood--- he was not a madman, in fact, he was more logical than most. There had to be something he was missing, something that would clear his conscience, and his strange sense of suspicion.  Since he had been ‘reunited’ with Billy, everything Okin thought he knew was being challenged.

“Change?” Okin’s trance was broken by the voice of a bundled, hidden figure.  “Change,” the vagrant said again, his voice a deep, dry croak.  The man’s features were covered by a gray, scraggy beard, and his head and body was engulfed in torn and mismatched blankets and textiles.

The Ather turned to the beggar, who was squished between the gap of two buildings, creating a small alleyway of sorts.  He dug into his coin pouch, took a few nickel steltells and reached down to place them in front of the seated figure--- who reached out and held Okin’s left wrist, snatching the coins out of his hand.

Okin pulled back in surprise, the coins dropping to the ground with a ping. The hooded figure looked up at the shocked Ather, his eyes hidden by thick, dirty hair.  

“I am sorry, kind sir,” the man said, strangely leaving the coins on the ground.  “I did not mean to startle you.”

Okin smiled.  “It is alright, I did not mean to be so impolite.”

The man’s cheeks raised, and although his teeth were hidden it appeared he was smiling back.  “Civility is not always a virtue, if civility hides the Truth,”  the man said.  “From Nexon, but surely you know that, kind Ather.”

*I... do not recall that line.  I believe I would remember it, especially if this man does.  Perhaps he is misquoting, or mistaken.*

“And from which book of Nexon is that line?”  Okin asked, leaning down.

“Well, Book Four, of course!” the bearded man laughed.  “Surely you are just fooling me, Ather.”

“Nexon Four?  I’m afraid there is no such thing,” Okin replied.  

The beggar shook his head.  “I am certain.  I just finished reading it!”

Okin’s eyes narrowed.  *This man must be insane. There is no Fourth Book of Nexon.  It would not be surprising, many men who live like this end up mentally destroyed.  I pray to Intillia and those Dedicated to her that together we may lift men like this out of poverty.*

“You *just* finished reading it?  Do you... have it on you?” Okin asked.

“Why, yes I do,” the vagrant chuckled.  “It feels strange, showing part of The Versalist Bible to an Ather.”

The man reached behind him, and there was a wrinkled, dirty book, if you can call it that, that was bound together by a thin piece of worn leather. It wasn’t very thick, and the pages were a dirty brown from wear.  The beggar flipped through the book, stopping as he hit a page in the middle.

“Here,” the beggar said, ripping out the page. Okin leaned down further, and the man pointed a long, chipped yellow nail at a line near the top.  “See, *Civility is not always a virtue, if civility hides the truth.* I feel somewhat silly, as you probably already knew that line by heart, unless if you didn’t, then you probably feel somewhat silly,” another hyena-like laugh came out.

Okin took the page, reading the following line; the man didn’t seem to mind.  It read, *If Aredal was just a little more pressing, a little less civil, then perhaps we wouldn’t be in this argument.  The same goes for Tregale.*

‘This... you claim this was written by Nexon himself?” Okin asked.

“Well, of course!” the dirtied man shouted.  “It is the Fourth Book of *Nexon*!  There is *no* way that you aren’t fooling me now, Ather.”

Okin scratched his head. *This man must be some kind of crazed author, creating his own line of events based on those of the Gods.  Still... something about this irks me.*

“I sincerely do not know about this supposed Fourth Book. May I perhaps keep this page?” Okin asked.

The man snorted.  “Well, I am done with it anyway. A few more steltells would be nice, though.”

Okin nodded, and threw down three more nickel stelltels at the beggar’s mat.

“Thank you, kind Ather.  Come back whenever you wish, I always enjoy the company,” the man said.

Folding up the paper, Okin nodded, leaving the beggar alone in the dark street with haste. He didn’t look back, he turned immediately down the intersecting road that led towards the visiting complex, sliding the wrinkled sheet into his personal satchel. Before entering The Citadel, the city built from the victory of The Gods, risen from the ash of Tregale’s forces of evil, the heart of humanity’s connection with The Four, Okin thought he understood it all. The one place where Athers went to strengthen their faith, to fortify their Dedication--- had left Okin with nothing but questions and doubt. Turning down an empty street, he leaned up against the wall and held the dinky paper out, reading what Nexon himself had supposedly written.

*And still, things get stranger.*
