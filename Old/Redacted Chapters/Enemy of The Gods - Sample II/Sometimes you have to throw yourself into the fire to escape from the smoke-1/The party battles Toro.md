From atop the hill, the ringing of the bell became mixed with the clopping of hoofs. The heavy riding rhythm of war horses. Billy made a quick turn, and was faced with the distant silhouette of four horses, all with armoured riders. 

‘Run!” He yelled out as he sprinted for the ship. Benjamin swore but kept pace easily, and to the side Allia shouted a command. But where was Damian? Billy turned around, spotting the boy a few dozen yards behind. The teen was staggering, barely running at all. The horses were gaining ground on Damian, and Billy’s heart dropped as he searched for a gun.  His hand blindly grasped around his waist, searching the familiar leather of his holster, but found nothing. *What about my knife?* Billy reached down towards his boots, searching for the knife, but again he came up empty. The Rothars were nothing if not thorough. To his right, a figure dashed forward. Black cloth ripped in the wind as Allia surged towards the Rothars. The riders had drawn close enough to no longer be silhouettes, now Billy could distinguish each and their rank. 

The group of three riders was helmed by a Devinar, his armour a work of art. An intricate array of smaller silver plates ringed around his arms, legs, and neck allowing for perfect articulation. The chest plate was a single piece,  the flowing curves lined with gold, the armour was inlaid with black symbols which ran across the chest plate like vines wrapping their way around his body.  Mounted atop was the helm. Angular, and pointed forward, it had a wolf like quality. On the trim a double helix ran across the angles and up towards the helmets two golden horns. The way every piece linked, working together was awe inspiring. In his hand he held a halberd over five feet long, with a head as elegant as the rest of his amour and a counter weight near the end.

*This is how men should be,* Billy thought. Compared to this Devinar, the common Rothars were like children playing dress up. The plain plate armour of the two Rothars was nothing in compassion to this work of art.

*The value doesn’t just come from the practical protection of the armour, son. It comes from the power people give it. The myth, the legends. I don’t care if it actually takes half a lifetime to forge, rather I perpetuate it because it makes it more valuable.* Billy remembered the way his father spoke of the armour fondly. 

A clanging of metal against metal came as Allia thrust her sword out, blocking a pike jab from one of the Rothars. In the moment that Billy had been lost in thought, the girl had engaged the three on horseback.  In between the three she danced between stabs, drawing attention from Damian. Slipping between even the smallest cracks the girl rushed forward like water.

“Damian, move your ass!” Billy called out. The leftmost Rothar stabbed down at Allia, and the girl made a quick motion to block. The shaft of the pike slid along her sword, leaving a faint opening. With her freehand, the girl grabbed the shaft and jerked it downwards. The Rothar faulted as his legs clamped around the horse for stability. In the blink of an eye, Allia slashed across his thigh and turned, facing the remaining Rothar. The other Rothar made a quick reaction, stabbing at Allia’s knees. The point of the halberd drew blood as it shot down her thigh. A low yell from Allia mixed with the sound of the previous Rothar falling from horse back. She batted back a second attack and the Rothar drew his horse away, positioning himself between the charging Devinar and Allia. 

In the face-off, Billy was able to properly observe Allia. The girl had on the flowing dress-like robes of an Istar, loose cuffs shrouding both hands. In her hands she held a strange make of sword. It had a thin, double-edged blade which tapered to a singular middle point. At around two and a half feet long, the blade resembled the common dueling sword. 

A sweeping motion of a halberd sent Allia back a step. Again the girl batted the tip away. She was trying to find an opening, but the Rothar was likely just buying time. The Devinar was barreling towards Billy, a heavily muscled black horse presenting death. Raising his hands, he prepared to fight, but instead the Devinar rode past him. The man drew his horse to a stop, blocking off the pier where their escape ship lay ready to launch. 

The man was almost lethargic as he dismounted. He didn’t drop to a battle stance, instead the man stood casually, grabbing a lantern-like box from the side of the horse. It had an iron frame with glass panes making up the sides. Save for one side, which was empty, revealing a roaring flame. 

An Elemental Herald. 

Based on the lantern strapped to his side, he had the power to command fire. Billy hoped that was all he could do. While some Elemental Heralds could command multiple elements, it was extremely rare. But one element was plenty enough to keep most occupied. 

“I am Toro ere Rosenda,” the man said. Behind, Billy could hear grunting as Allia tried her best to fight back towards Billy and Damian. Toro clipped the lantern against his weight, threading the top through a railing  in the back of his breastplate. 

“High Ather Okin has sentenced you to judgement at the hands of the Gods themselves. But I am not in the business of sentencing you to judgement, only sending you to judgment.” He twirled the halberd around before snapping down into a battle stance. One foot pointed out at Billy, while the other lay perpendicular. 

“Surrender now, and I may not have to harm you.” Toro took a step forward, his halberd testing towards Billy. Billy blinked, and time came to a slow. He quickly dodged a whack from Toro with the blunt end of the spear by leaning backwards, avoiding the sweep of the staff. He lurched backwards, putting a hand in front of Damian. The teen looked half dead, sweat stained his clothes and matted his hair. 

“Now’d be the time to use some of that magic shit you got,” Billy said. The Devinar tested forwards again. The spike rushed past him, drawing a faint line of blood along Billy’s skin. 

“I...I...I....” Damian stuttered, “I can’t.” 

“Why can’t you?” Billy yelled, pushing the pair away from Toro. “It’s dark enough outside.” 

The lad eyed the Devinar with a bitten lip, his arms shaking. Of course, Damian would continue to refuse the one thing he might be useful for. It was so infuriating, by refusing to use his Heraldry, Damian just made himself helpless, putting himself in further danger.

“The demon hides itself. I pray to the Gods that he is not controlling you, and that we are hunting down an innocent man,” Toro said, and Billy’s teeth grinded, his eyes shot daggers at the Devinar. 

*Forget what I said about this guy. He’s just another boot-licking cinker.*

Billy wanted to yank that spear out of his hands and ruin his face with it. However, he knew that could give the man an opportunity to strike at Damian, and it would be extremely foolish to attack an armoured *Herald* without a weapon.

Damian was silent as Billy continued to wheel them away. One of the Rothars turned his horse around, preparing to charge and hit them with his spear. Time slowed again, and Billy pushed Damian aside and dodged the rumbling legs of the horse, which now moved at the pace of a Gran, the crashes of its steps like a slow drumbeat. He blinked again after he had pushed himself and Damian out of the beast’s path, and it flew past, its hooves once again a rapid drumroll.

The Devinar snarled, that in itself causing Damian to jump back and cower behind Billy. Toro touched his hip where the lantern dangled, but frowned and shook his head, reconsidering.  He then put both hands on his spear, and lurched forward,  swinging the staff again at Billy and Damian, avoiding the sharp end.

Billy knew this was coming and slowed down time, easily avoiding the attack, and still leaving him time to push Damian farther backwards. Toro stabbed again with the dull end, and Billy leaned to the left, pushing away the staff to the right, forcing Toro to pause and regain his balance.

Metal crashed behind him as the Rothar’s steed collapsed, sending his rider down with him. Allia vaulted over the falling body of the horse, pouncing on the Rothar. The girl’s sword clattered to the ground as she grappled with the man. Billy made for the sword, turning it and facing down the Devinar. It was lighter than he expected, as if made of wood, not steel. 

On the ground the man groaned, trying to push Allia back. The girl locked her legs around his chest, and forced his legs down with hers. One hand to his helmet, the other reached for a dagger at her side. 

“Get off me, girl!” The Rothar growled. His voice shook as the dagger hovered into his view. He had one hand on Alllia’s face, the other did its best to stop the incoming dagger.

“Toro!” He yelled out. But his voice was lost under a primal growling from Allia. The girl yelled like a banshee as she forced the dagger through the eye slit of the armour, pressing it deep into the Rothar’s skull. Billy had seen his fair share of death, but mostly at the end of guns. The barbarity of the way Allia fought shocked him. Or was this how everyone fought? The spear was never something his father gave much weight, so he had never truly learned how to fight in any classical Wreathwardian style. Maybe here, this brutality was normal. 

A halberd stab broke Billy’s stunned expression. In his pause, Toro had lunged to stab at Allia. 

“I was supposed to bring the two back alive. Never did they say anything about a girl.” There was a sickening sound of pierced fleshed as the spike drove itself through skin. But it wasn’t Allia who screamed out, rather the response was a small whimper from Damian. 

The\[ Possible Change ---\>\] youth’s body slipped off the tip and landed with a smacking noise against the stone. While Allia looked at Damian in shock, Billy saw an opening. Awkwardly he hoisted the sword over his head before swinging down against the plated arm of the Devinar. A shockwave rocked his bones, causing him to drop the sword. His hands burned with pain from the shockwave.

Toro wheeled around the wooden shaft of the halberd, knocking Billy to the ground. “I believe I warned you not to test me.” Billy’s heard was spinning, his vision blurring as he did his best to get back to his feet. There was another sound of ripping metal from in impact at Toro’s back. Allia was on her feet, clutching the halberd of the fallen Rothar. She was awkward with the heafty weapon, her stab nearly missing the Devinar. Toro dogged back and shot out his arm towards Allia. From the lantern at his waist, a plume of fire shot out towards Allia. She dropped into a roll, and shot her hand out towards the fire. The light of the fire dimmed and a faint glow returned to Allia’s eyes. Toro whipped his arm across his body and the flame plume looped back around towards the girl. Without hesitation Allia charged Toro, her eyes glowing brighter by the second.

Toro stepped back and dropped back into his proper stance, both hands on his halberd. With that the chasing flame faded, but Allia’s glow held. The Devinar swung the halberd vertically down onto her, nearly splitting her in half. Allia spun about as parts of her robe caught on the axehead. She contained to spin, ripping the rest of the cloth free. Splaying her fingers out, palm facing Toro, a beam of light shot out. A solid, blinding, pure white light in the darkness of the night. The light rippled across the armour in weblike patterns as Toro was sent to the ground. 

Allia looked a mess, loose bun causing matted hair to hang over hair, and dried blood coating the side of her leg. The wound where she had been stabbed had been cauterized.

“Move, quickly! I did not have enough Light, so he will stir soon,” she shouted. In opposition to her frantic appearance and tone, she calmly grabbed her sword and sheathed it in a practiced motion.

Grabbing Damian by his torso, she quickly dragged the stunned teen along the pier and onto the gangway. From the ship, Benjamin leaned over and hoisted Damian onto the deck. 

“I don’t know about you, but personally, I would prefer to not meet my end here,” she said as she pushed Billy up onto the ship.

Armoured plates clicked together as the Devinar slowly pushed himself off the ground. Still stunned, he made a brief check on the lantern, which miraculously had yet to go out.

“It appears,” he said. “That taking you alive is no longer an option. I suppose, I will have to send you to the Gods for judgment myself.” 

Toro reached behind himself and whipped his arm forward. From the lantern, a gangly hand of fire shot towards Billy. He did his best to duck under the flames, but a scorching sear still ripped across his back. The pain flared over his lower back even after the fire had passed him. He writhed and gnawed down on his own cheek, trying to push himself up. 

“Fucking help us, won’t you?” He yelled out to some of the sailors who idled. 

“Helping you would be equivalent to going against Versalism itself. I suspect most of these men think themselves quite pious.” Allia touched a hand towards his lower back and the pain retreated. 

Most of the sailors continued to stand idle, scratching their heads and looking away as if nothing was happening. One however leaned over the side of the ship that was adjacent to the wider ocean,  as if he was trying to catch a fish in his bare hands.

From the edge of the, far off into the ocean, a little bit of sunlight peeked over the horizon. In tandem, something large and bulbous began to rise out of the water, on the side of the ship the lone sailor was leaning over.

“Sunrise,” she said softly. “I suppose we will live yet.” She withdrew her hand and the pain returned, but more muted. 

Another plume of fire shot over head, and Allia quickly whipped a bucket on the deck towards the flame. It fizzled to steam long enough for Allia to dodge clear of the attack. 

“Devinar Toro, like most men of this ship, I do not wish to attack you. But, I suppose I must,” Allia said. Toro nearly laughed as she stepped up towards the edge. She may have been a killer, but with her short stature and wide eyes it was hard to believe she could really take down a Devinar. 

“My name is Allia Su-Han, Kadonsong of The Order of Tsuman,” with the words Allia’s skin burst alight. Her veins glowed white, and small plumes of steam began to rise of her body.  Billy looked away from the bright glow, backing up onto the ship and covering his eyes. Even with his own Heraldry, this power made him feel so awkward, so small.

“And I hereby sentence you to judgement by your Gods,” the girl twisted the pommel of her sword, revealing a glowing light identical in colour to that which glowed in her veins. She drew the sword and pointed it at Toro. The energy within traveled from her chest towards her hands as the blade of the sword began to glow. The light pooled at the tip before bursting forth in a solid white beam. Light distorted around it as the beam raced towards Toro. The light screeched as it cut through the armour. Ripples of light waved across the armour and behind him, a hole was burned into the ground. Allia held the sword out until it shattered. White sparks dotted the deck and the sharp explosion sent her barrelling to the floor. Her body rolled and for a moment she was still, unconscious. 

Billy and the rest of the crew looked down to the girl, unsure of what to do, of whether she was unconscious, dead, or alive. Their question was answered as she flew up, gasping for air.

Allia pushed herself onto her knees as her hair--- now undone---fell around her face. 

“Captain,” she said between raged breathes. “I request that you return us to Hwasadon.” 

“Of course, Kadonsong, ” the captain said. He was the same man who had been leaning over the ship as if he was fishing something out of the water previously. His movements were lethargic as he did his best to shake away the shock which was apparent on his face. The crew did the same as they attended their stations. The gangway was drawn, and the sailors all piled into the middle of the deck, shouting commands, but the boat did not move forward. 

Billy, oblivious to the commotion around him, stared down at Allia with wide eyes.

“What are you?” He asked her. 

“A girl, according to yourself. Should you not be asking *who* I am instead?” The girl smiled a little as she stumbled to her feet. She crashed against a pole before walking with legs wobbling below deck. \[ 2021-03-09, 6:17 PM

I don’t really get this line\]

Billy cleared his head, finally looking away from the clumsy---yet surprisingly awesome in terms of battle prowess---girl. For the first time, he noticed the giant shadow that was looming over him. 

Above the ship, a massive, bubbly, translucent blob with a gaping hole on its bottom floated. Dozens of thin, stringy, loosely waving tendrils reached out to the sides of the ship, gluing the strange creature to every side.

Billy had heard of these creatures before. Ytthernus.

The captain did some strange pointing with his hand directed at the massive mouth-like hole of the Ytthernu, his mouth forming many *ohs* and *ahs* despite no sound coming out. Like many of the most valuable animals in the world, Ytthernus harnessed powers that almost mimicked Heraldry in a strange way. The strange mental bond made people suspect Dark Heraldry, which made them taboo in Wreathward, but debatable.

The other power which it definitely displayed was some form of Space Heraldry, allowing it to pull objects *thousands* of times its own weight, and---

Fly.

The ship set sail *over* the Sethenin Ocean.
