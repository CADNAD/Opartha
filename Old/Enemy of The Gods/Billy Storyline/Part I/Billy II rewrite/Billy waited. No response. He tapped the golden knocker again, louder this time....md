Billy waited. No response. He tapped the golden knocker again, louder this time.

Billy sighed and shook his head. He turned around and looked at the entire front of the property from the top of the steps. It didn’t make any sense; the bushes looked as if they had been trimmed at most a *week* ago, not ten years ago. And tulips probably died in a couple days if they weren’t watered, or so Billy guessed.

Someone was here, someone was home. The sun was *very* close to setting, and most pious Wreathwardians would have returned to their houses already.

Damian still stood outside the gate, and he looked even paler than usual. Seeing the boy, like that, in the dark--- it stirred up a feeling of guilt and fear inside of him.

Billy whipped around. He ripped off his glove and knocked with his hand, louder, until his fist hurt.

The knocking rung in his ears, and his vision faded away.
