** chapter
The Monastery was more comfortable than Billy had expected. Where he had expected stone beds and fasting diets, he had found plush beds and full dining halls.  Damin and himself had been assigned comfortable accommodations, a large living room and two bedrooms. Like all the rooms of the Monastery, they were carved into spines of the great Beast. A window had even been carved in the living room, a luxury according to Voshri.
The girl had come twice in the week since their arrival. Once on the first day, with her taller brother, to guide them on a tour of the spine. The second time to deliver a book for Damin to study. She had lingered. Longer than she should.
Everyday was the same. Training begun in the morning, and stretched well into the afternoon. When they did break for lunch, the food would always be over-spiced. A mess of spices that nearly made him wish for the bland gruel of the mines. After training, each Herald was given a set of tasks to attend to. Some helped with the farms on the Beast's back, others took a shift operating the elevators, and others maintaining the delicate environment of the Monastery. All duties Billy had been excused from so far. As a newcomer he'd been looked down upon, too incompetent to help with the tasks at hand. He wasn't sure he was more glad to finaly have a day off or angry at how they obviously thought of him as a stupid child.
Cold leached into him as Billy sat on the floor of the training ground. Around him, and on the various padded mats, Heralds of all types fought hand-to-hand. They were all supervised by the brown haired man from the Council, Torin. Torin watched the students closely, before bringing them to attention with a shout and a raised fist. Now was the most entertaining part of the day-- where the 'master' would spar a large group of students at once. The students formed a circle around him, with some of them dragging the padded mats to form a larger area that stretched from wall to wall, where the walls were also padded.
Billy scooched back to lean against the wall. Torin eyed Billy, but gave him no response. He turned to the circle of eight students who surrounded him, 

He was a Light Herald, like Billy, perhaps the most powerful one Billy had ever encountered. Billy could not deny that his abilities were anything short of /impressive/; blasts of white Light exploded from his arms and legs as he slammed back kicks and hits from several students at once, sending them flying and crashing down. These students each could fight several trained men at once-- one threw This was a Light power Billy had never seen before, which while unusual was not unexpected, there were probably few men in the world traveled enough to have witnessed every Light power.
A little voice in his head clamored with excitement-- maybe he could be one of those few men to witness them all here? Maybe he would even /himself/ be able to unlock a new Light power here?
/Nonsense./ Billy crossed his arms. These people may have had impressive skills, but ultimately they were hiding out on this big bird in the sky; it was just combat as a gimmick; they were like the circus he worked for in Apathasaw, but at least the circus /performed/ for actual people.
Still, it was undeniably amazing to watch. Billy tried to get a good look at Torin's face to see what emotion was being channeled for this power. The middle-aged man made a face that was somewhat terrifying with each deflecting hit, like a growling bear. Though he kept it obviously controlled it, it seemed like it there was an undercurrent of anger. Torin could obviously swat the students off like flies with this sole power if he desired, but this mastery was not one-note. He turned around to all the sweaty, out of breathe students pick themselves up from the floor, and looked at them all as a group. Then, he sighed, and the corners of his lips fell-- the ferocious snarling teeth were gone in a second. He was feeling something much more internal.
A bald, muscled student grit his teeth and charged at Torin. His fist and upper arm reflected a steel glare-- an existential threat to most men.
And when the fist was a few feet from Torin's face, the master /dissappeared/.
Billy lurched forward from the wall. Torin was nowhere to be seen.
The student swung wildly with his steel fist, at a speed that would crush the bones of the average man. But the only effect was the /woosh/ of the air, and the scream of the student. 
"YAH!" The student yelped, as his feet flew forward. /SLAM!/ He fell on his back. The other seven quickly closed in, as Torin reappeared, leaping up from the mat like a frog after successfully sweeping the student's legs.
A red-haired student was fast-- faster that even the most well-trained athlete could move. /Jerkwad Subject,/ Billy thought. Billy could already tell this guy didn't like him-- they had been having a stink-eye contest over the past week.
However, he was one of the best students at using his Heraldry. Before, he was the only one who was able to get off successful hits on Torin, though he was still slammed back by Torin's reflective power. He dodged to the side as Torin jumped and kicked two students down, one with each leg. Torin flipped back onto his feet, springing back up in an instant and jump-kicking a third-- but he flew farther that expected as the student vanished, immeadiately appearing on the other side of the matter where Torin had come from. The Subject Herald, being able to see this in slow motion, was able to react first and sent a push kick right for Torin's chest-- his feet tapped and slid, barely providing enough friction to prevent him from falling and losing.
Torin quickly reganined his fighting stance-- he swung to block just as the student who had teleported behind him tried to kick him in the back, and though his back was turned he was able to thrust a kick backwards just as the Subject Herald tried to grapple him. The Subject lowered into a grappling stance, as did the others who circled Torin. If they could all surround him at once, it wouldn't matter how many of them had to wrestle him down, the game would be theirs.
The others glanced at each other, subtly forming a plan of attack. Torin turned, an arm raised in each direction.
The students turned back to Torin. Now they circled, and he stopped in place, his head facing the wall that Billy was leaning against.
Billy thought he saw Torin wink in his direction, before the man's face turned into a totally neutral stare.
"NOW!"
The Subject screamed. Billy sat up-- the room went WHITE with blinding Light, Billy barely covering his eyes.
"FUCK!" Billy wasn't the only one who cursed. Bodies crashed into each other and plopped onto the mat.
By the time Billy had regained his vision, the students were untangling themselves from the pile of bodies on the floor. Torin stood with his hands clasped, giving a little cheeky smile before reaching out to help an olive-skinned student off the ground.
"Another loss," the Subject Herald sighed.
"On the contrary, that was a good reaction Draxuun, and good teamwork, Hafabi," Torin gave a nod to the red-headed Subject Herald and the round-faced Teleportation Herald. 
Billy's grasp of their language using Suspiscion had gotten a lot better; It was the only thing worth putting effort in so far. He had to get a better idea of who these people were, what they were trying to indoctrinate him, and more importantly Damin with. So far, he hadn't caught anything too strange in Torin's classes. The Light Herald seemed the most affable on the Council.
"Yeah, Draxuun, you're being too negative. Of course we would lose fighting master Torin. It's not something to worry about, focus on the lesson," the bald Solid Herald barked. 
"You never know, you might meet a more powerful Light master than me one day," Torin stepped back as the students gathered in a line. They bowed to him in unison, and he returned a much slower, lingering bow.
"The chances of that are so unlikely," a student with a nasally voice resumed speaking as they sat down criss-crossed on the mat. "We have the most powerful Heralds in the world, and you have ... the most Light powers here."
"You don't know who the most powerful Light Herald in the world is. Maybe it's that young man over there," Torin smiled and pointed his chin at Billy.
The student's all looked over their shoulders at Billy. For a second, he felt like one of the circus animals in Apathasaw being ogled by dumb kids after the show was over. He glared back at them.
"I don't think so," the nasally-voiced student replied.
"
/Is this really all they do? Get beat up by one guy way more powerful than they are, and then listen to a huge lecture by him afterward, even though they were screwed the whole time?/
"It doesn't matter if you're the most powerful. You're more powerful than they are, and they were fucking screwed. Now you're gonna tell them it was their fault they got screwed, when the game was rigged from the start. That's how it always works, whether Heraldry or not."


"Don't 
"I don't judge what emotions people channel. All are necessary. What is it? Powerlessness? Insecurity?"
Billy scoffed. "No. Just not everyone wants to join your gay little troop."
