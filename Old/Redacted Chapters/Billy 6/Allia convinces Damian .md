Billy held the bronze doorknob in his hand as he thought of what’d he say to the girl. He couldn’t very well go angering the girl. Not only was her power daunting, she had control of the ship as well. Pushing open the door, he prepared to argue with her nonetheless, but instead he found only Damian. 

Damian sat on a plush red reading chair, one of two in the room, arrayed to face the desk. Behind it a large window gave way to the lapping of the sea in the wake of the ship. The desk was empty save for three books, one of which lay open. To either side of the room two doors led to offshoot rooms. While one was closed, the other door was open and a faint crackling sound came from within. 

“Billy? You’re awake?” Damian asked. The teen looked better than Billy remembered. He had gotten a fresh set of clothes and was now dressed in one of those coats the sailors wore. Double breasted and waist length, Damian wore the dark blue coat unbuttoned, revealing a white undershirt. 

“What the fuck are you doing here?” Billy moved quickly across the room and leaned over the back of the reading chair. 

“I figured...” Damian played with his fingers as he fumbled the words. Cink, had he always been this meek?

“It’s not safe here, Damian. I don’t think we should be mingling with her too much,” Billy said. He tried to calm the hint of fury that he had accidentally let out on Damian.

“I just figured I should try and learn what’s going on. I know more about The Order of Tsuman so I thought maybe I could prod around till you came around.” Damian looked up, and Billy had to concede as he met the boy’s hopeful eyes.

“Yeah, it wasn’t a half bad idea.” 

From the open door, a female voice came. “I do apologize for the delay. I commandeered the captain’s supply, yet I fail to make use of them. It has been far too long since I had to be gracious. Forces forgive me.”

Allia stepped out of the side room carrying a small steel kettle. Like Damian, she had cleaned up significantly. Her hair was tied in a bun and she had on a long blue uniform coat, buttoned up at the sides. The uniform fit tightly around her body, and Billy was surprised by her relatively broad shoulders.

“Would you like a drink as well?” Allia set the tea set down on a small table between the two lounging chairs. The cups clinked together with the familiar sound of porcelain. 

“What is it?” Billy said

“Tea. The captain claims it comes from Beisan, yet judging by the smell I highly doubt that.” Allia poured the tea into a cup at Damian’s side. With a small nod the younger man took the tea and began to slowly sip it.

“Do you have anything stronger?” Billy asked. 

“I don’t doubt the captain keeps his stores well-stocked. Yet I am hesitant to hand you that particular deposit.” She poured herself a cup before setting the kettle down. 

Billy grunted a response, maybe Benjamin would pull through for him. He rounded the table and dropped into the reading chair. His body sunk into the velveteen surface,  

“So, where the fuck are we headed to?” Billy eyed Damian, seeing if he knew the answer. 

Damian set his cup down slowly, “Yahi, then to Meridaz island.”

“And what’s it gonna cost us?” Billy asked. 

“Nothing,” Allia replied curtly. 

“Ain’t nothing every truly free.”

“Then your time is your payment,” Allia settled into a large leather chair behind the desk. She ran he hands along the outline of the table, slowly creeping her body over it till she lay low atop the wooden surface.

“Our time? So you can peddle your bullshit to us?” Billy threw his legs ontop of the table between the two chairs. Allia turned slowly to face him, a long sigh escaping her lips.

“Tell me, honestly, have you considered where you’re going to go? You escaped prison, and in doing so killed four Rothars, well, perhaps only three. I think the one who fell was just unconscious, at least I hope so. *And* you also killed a Devinar,” Allia said.

“You killed, not me.”

“Okay then, let us say that you don’t get blamed for the killings, and they arrest me instead. Wonderous, now you are still on trial for murdering your father, or so the evidence claims. High Ather Okin is more devoted than any man I’ve ever seen. Not only is he devout, he holds some modicum of power. He will hunt you down. The blemish on his reputation would be too high otherwise. Even if he doesn’t punish you due to some strange sense of compassion, the Impalias who commands him most certainly will. You were prosecuted in a city under his control, and escaped from what should be his control. So where will you go?” 

Billy thought for a moment. Allia wasn’t wrong, and that irked him. They likely would be hunted, and that would mean they could never live even semi-normal lives anywhere in Wreathward. 

“We ran once, so we’ll run again.”

“But running where?” 

“How the Feixiang-Nihdian Commonwealth?” Damian said. 

“Yes, the Tzen empire does seem an attractive idea,” Allia said, rubbing her chin. “Yet, there you would be hunted still. They’ve been exersizing every channel they can in order to please The Citadel. That includes executions of Dark Heralds.” Allia turned to look Damian down. Instinctively, Billy reached a hand over the table towards Damian’s arm. He shot Allia a biting glare.

“Farsun then,” Billy said. “They love Dark Heralds there, and hate the rest of Wreathward.” 

Allia nodded slowly, seemingly satisfied at the answer. “The most logical choice, however, there appears to be a war brewing between them and The Citadel. Do you remembered what happened the last time they went too far?”\[ 2021-01-16, 1:50 PM

I don’t think this should be very common knowledge. If Allia knows this, which I don’t think she should, Damian should be very surprised.\]

“They lost...” Damian said quietly. The teen folded his hands over each other, and lacing his fingers in and out in a nervous motion.

Allia gave a solemn nod, “so your options are limited then.” 

Billy and Damian slowly nodded. 

“So, come with me then. I’ll provide to you safe passage, meals and hosing, and freedom.”

*What freedom was there to even be had?* All they would get was an illusion of freedom, that’s all anyone seemed to give out. 

“Alright, and what if we say yes? What’s in it for you?” Billy asked. He swung his legs off the low table and dragged the reading chair forward. It was unyieldingly heavy, maybe the heaviest chair Billy had ever had the displeasure of using. 

“Come on, ain’t no such thing as a free meal.”

Allia hesitated for a moment. The girl’s bottom lip curled in as she bit it lightly. “You speak to the Dakungs. I know Damian and your companion Benjamin are both Heralds, I suspect you may be as well?” 

*Don’t give her a tell, don’t let the bitch worm her way into your head.* Billy locked his eyes with her and counted the beats of his breathing, careful to keep his heart rate at a normal level. He doubted she could notice such intricacies, but one had to always account for even the smallest details. 

“It doesn’t really matter, two Heralds will be more than enough---“

“More than enough for what?” Billy interrupted.

Allia’s lip twitched at the interruption. Billy guessed it was a rare occurrence for the girl to be combated like that.

“More than enough to secure you all you could want,” she finally replied.

“And what do they want *us* for?” Billy pushed off from the chair and leaned over the desk. Leaning over the desk, his was only inches from her’s.

“The forces gift us all for enumerable reasons. It is not my job to say why you have been gifted so. The Dakungs will tell you, they will tell you what is required of you.” 

“What, are you too stupid to know?” Billy asked. 

“Billy...” Damian lightly grabbed at his arm, tugging him back. But Billy stayed in front of Allia, immovable . 

“Huh, too stupid aren’t you-”

A hand grabbed at Billy’s neck and slammed him down against the table. Pain pulsed through him as he blinked away his the darkness at the fringe of his vision. Allia’s face entered into his dazed view from above. The girl’s eyes had widened and Billy’s hair stood on end as a wave of fear washed through him. This was the real Allia, wasn’t it, the feral beast that had so brutally screamed as she murdered man after man in Metheno. 

In a moment, that monster quickly faded, and he was released. Something in Allia seemed to retreat as her eyes shifted. Her pupils seemed to widen, and her mouth hung slightly agape in shock. 

“I... I apologize for my sudden outburst,” Allia dusted her hands against the uniform coat. “Perhaps I can requisition some of the alcohol previously requested in apology?” 

“Cink  you,” Billy muttered. A sudden attack, only to apologize for it? What was wrong with this girl? But booze was booze, and Billy wasn’t a man to look a gift horse in the mouth. 

“Yeah, I guess that might work. Would make this whole kidnapping go over smoother for both of us.” 

Allia gave a stiff, practiced nod before settling back into her chair. She slumped against the padded wood, and tapped her fingers in a slow rhythm against the wood. 

“Accompany me home, talk to the Dakungs and listen to what they have to say. I’ll ensure your needs are provided for until then. If after all that you are not satisfied and *still* wish to flee, then I shall charter you a boat to wherever you wish. This is my final offer.” Allia folded her hands. Slowly the girl leaned over the table. The same motions as before, but with a different air. A pleading air? 

“I’ll go,” Damian said. 

Billy shot a glance back at the teen, sitting tall and confident. Of all the things to finally be assured of, this is what he had to pick?  

“You can’t be serious, can you?” Billy asked

“Billy, what other options do we have? Benjamin came with us, so he obviously can’t get himself, or us, back. Our money is gone so we can’t get back to Apathasaw any other way. Allia is right, our best option is going with her. Maybe we’ll come up with something better on the way, but right now... I don’t know Billy.” The boy ran a hand up the opposing arm as he shivered. *He was being serious. Aredal damn you girl, Damian was serious*. 

“Not maybe, we will come up with something better.” Billy said. The two looked back at Allia who seemed to have relaxed her shoulders at the news. They had power over her, power Damian had squandered by being so agreeable. Maybe it was finally time to teach Damian something about being his own man. 

“I’ll be down below, waiting for my apology,” Billy strode across the cabin and hastily jerked the door open, closing it behind him. On deck, several sailors looked over warily at the noise. Billy shot them back a deathly glare before disappearing below deck to suffer the rest of the joinery.
