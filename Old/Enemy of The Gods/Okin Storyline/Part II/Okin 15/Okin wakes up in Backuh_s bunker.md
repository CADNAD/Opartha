Okin rubbed his eyes and opened them.

It wasn’t much brighter than when they had been closed. His confusion faded when he remember he was in Ateon’s... underground bunker. He had been so tired that he didn’t remember falling asleep.

“Ateon?” Okin stood up and grabbed the lamp. The beaked mask was still on the ground next to him, and he picked it up as well.

“Okin,” a voice said from the darkness. Okin turned the lamp to it, and saw Ateon’s cloaked form.

“You’re awake. Good. You must stay here for your safety until I find where the conspirators will be meeting next. I will bring you food and things to study. For now you can start with---“

“No,” Okin interrupted. “I know where they may be meeting next.”

Ateon’s shadow leaned in closer. 

“Aldwin’s son--- my friend, Previa--- Aldwin is hosting a birthday party for him at his manor, to promote his run for Impalias. It’s--- it’s today, actually.”

“It is not safe, Okin,” Ateon’s voice boomed. “They will know that you are still here, and our cover will be blown.”

“Well how can I stop them by just *hiding* in this underground bunker?” Okin shouted. “It is dangerous, but--- I must--- I must be Brave. This is the only connection we have to this group, and I know that Aldwin is at the centre of this. There will be several dozen attendees, most of whom are clergy, and I will be able to blend in. An opportunity like this may not ever show itself again.”

Ateon sighed. “Fine. You must be careful not to blow your cover, though. Stay on the outside, and if it appears risky, return here. I will--- I will watch from nearby to ensure nothing goes wrong.”

A childish cheer exploded in Okin’s heart, and he smiled. He *would* do this. He *would* find something to damn these conspirators and reveal the word of the Gods.

“There is *no* way you are leaving this place looking like *that*, though.” Ateon pointed to Okin’s neck, and Okin raised his lamp and looked down.

He had somewhat forgotten that there was a giant bloody stain around the neck and chest of his formerly white robes. *That* would be a problem.

“I--- I will return to the visiting complex--- just to get one of my other robes. I will be---“

“That would be walking into a death trap,” Ateon said. “There is--- there is one solution, though. Just give me a minute.”

Ateon retreated back into the shadows, and Okin raised an eyebrow.

Less than ten seconds later, Ateon’s figure returned back into the aura of lamplight. He held some folded clothes in his arms---

The gold fabric reflected glittered under the fire. In his arms were an identical, folded white and gold Ather’s robe.

“These were my old robes. Don’t worry, they are clean,” Ateon handed them to Okin.

Okin took them in his arms. He looked back up to Ateon. The man didn’t appear to have his Ather’s satchel though maybe it was piled up somewhere else along the dark walls of the bunker. But he *had* kept his robes, despite abandoning the clergy. How long had it been since he wore these? 

“You can change here. Don’t worry, I’ll turn around,” Ateon chuckled.

Okin scowled, and took his lamp to the farther side of the room, where the ladder was. 

He removed his bloodied robe over his head. He didn’t realize how *sweaty* his undergarments had gotten. He felt a little gross again, but hygiene wasn’t a concern for desperate men. Pushing the feeling down, he covered his sweat with Ateon’s robes, and felt a little cleaner.

He dusted them off--- Ateon must’ve washed them occasionally or something, as they were actually quite clean.

“I’m done,” Okin raised the lamp toward the ladder of the bunker.

A few seconds passed, and Ateon stepped out of the shadows.

“Come on, then,” he said.

“Let us get prepared.”
