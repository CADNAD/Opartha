* Tregale Five
** Deionis
- his mental state and dark dimension represents a negative relationship with the symbolic orde (the Delmian social order). He hallucinates other significant figures from it, with aid from his Dark Heraldry.
** Parsalinah
- chemistry-interested Elemental Herald. True believer in Tregale's mission (though she doesn't know he wants to kill all the Gods).

* Ty-Shou
** Treat him more like he's Three!
