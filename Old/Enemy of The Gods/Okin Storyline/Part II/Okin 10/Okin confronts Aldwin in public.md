Okin peered through the window. It was difficult to see through the tessellated glass, but he was certain it was him; his body and head looked identical. 

If it was his time, then it was Okin’s, too.

The Ather marched right from the back window past one of the menacing stone pillars which upheld the Cathedral ere Rentar, the sixth largest Cathedral in The Citadel. It’s simplistic grey-white stone yet towering pillars and rooftops reflected how the God of Justice, and moreover the concept of holy Justice itself, was not so much about arrogance, showmanship, or wealth, but about upholding a fair and balanced rule of law.

There was no door, either, only two guards in front of the innermost pillars, who did not stand in the way of any who were not disturbing Justice. 

Okin strut in. He was not overly flamboyant, but he did stand up tall to ensure he was seen. Each step down the concrete brought a few more of those thirty-or-so eyes seated in the front few pews. 

And they caught Aldwin’s, too. He was right, the man was at the podium. His attention momentarily directed to Okin, but he did not pause his speech.

And so, Okin stopped in the middle of the aisle between two of the front pews and waited for Aldwin to finish.

“...here, in times when such holy trials present themselves to us, we must preach and practice unity. No man, no matter their rank or prestige can truly understand the Wisdom and will of the Gods. Only together do we have a hope at realizing the Gods’ vision of Opartha.”

There was a brief applause at that, and Aldwin paused and smiled. Okin waited for the applause to simmer, but struck before Aldwin could recommence his speech.

“But how can we possibly realize their vision,” the shocked crowd of clergy turned to him, “If we do not even know all that they have said to us?”

Okin searched for a break in Aldwin’s composure, there was none. However, many of the formerly attentive, calm Athers had started to rabble. One stood to his feet to speak to Okin. 

“High Ather, this is not an open forum for discussion at the---“

“It’s alright, Ather Demly. Well, Okin, I believe that yes, it would be impossible,” Aldwin’s voice boomed over the other Ather’s. “The Values of the Gods work in harmony, without Knowledge, we are but wandering sheep.” Aldwin maintained a calm, even friendly demeanor. Okin knew that he still had to be fairly aggressive to get anything out of Aldwin and to ensure this stuck in the mind of the crowd, but now he also had to stay cordial or else play in to Aldwi’s hand and risk looking a madman.

“How can you say that--- when you hide Knowledge from the Gods from the masses?” Okin retaliated.

“I am a bit confused by what you’re saying. Are you claiming that The Citadel, and myself, do not do enough to spread the word of the Gods to the lower classes? Because if you are, I believe that I *am* guilty---“

“No!” Okin bellowed. His nerves stung at Aldwin’s audacity. “You and I both know that that is not what I’m speaking of.” As soon as the words left his lips, he felt regret--- he shouldn't have interrupted, or sounded so offensive.

“Then what is it that you are speaking of, my friend?” Aldwin asked.

Okin clenched his jaw at that. Only days before\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-21 11:55 AM

Perhaps change due to Part time skip\] Aldwin was nothing *but* Okin’s friend, and mentor, and leader, and even like a father. But now, it was clear that Aldwin was just using these polite terms to get a rise out of him, as they both knew how infuriating it was to Okin that Aldwin was lying to his face.

The anger was too much to control in the moment, though. With a sharp finger, Okin shouted at the podium.

“There are words from the Gods that he is hiding! Doctrine that is the same as those we study every day, there is more! And he knows of it! He has it!”

Okin noticed his breath was growing wild, and calmed himself. Shocked, even fearful eyes were all around him, and Aldwin didn’t look any worse for wear.

Another High Ather stood up to reply to Okin.

“You are claiming that an Impalias of The Citadel--- an Impalias of *Aredal*, for that matter, has been lying to the masses, to his fellows? I have had the honour of knowing Aldwin for decades and he has never been even remotely dishonest with me. And your accusation--- the scripture of the Gods was all discovered a thousand years ago! Aldwin has been *alive* for a fraction of that time! Do you understand how *ridiculous,* furthermore *impossible* this accusation is?”

Okin’s breath grew thin, and he struggled to force out a response. Only rage brewed within as he took in the disbelieving, judgmental faces of his fellow Athers...

“Do not demonize him,” Aldwin chimed in. Okin’s neck jerked to focus on the Impalias again. “High Ather Okin, I do not believe that he has *ever* knowingly spoke anything that is not the most absolute Truth. Perhaps he is just misinformed, but I am *sure* that he only has the Values of Aredal in mind.”

Aldwin was so calming, so reasonable, that for a second Okin questioned whether maybe he *was* mistaken. But no, Aldwin had used the identical civil, reasonable manipulation on him earlier. A darker question brewed in Okin’s mind: how many times had Aldwin lied to him before, and he just didn’t know it?

“I am *not* misinformed, Aldwin! Do not make me look a fool. You!” Okin reached out his arms to the crowd. “I apologize that I have come in here, so brash, so flamboyant. But you must understand--- knowing Aldwin my whole life and realizing that he was hiding such a secret all this time---“

“Yes, perhaps we understand the pain you are feeling,” the standing Ather interjected. “But it is still clear that you are mad.”

“I’m sorry, Okin,” another elder Ather stood to his feet. Okin *knew* this man; High Ather Mulos was one of the Dedicants of Intillia he respected most in all of Opartha. 

“But you were not invited here, and I suggest you leave. I do not know and do not want to guess what has gone on between---,” Mulnos paused to motion to Aldwin, who was still at the podium, “your own Impalias, your own sponsor. Perhaps you have been misinformed, but if this is due to some feud between you two, I strongly urge you to pray to Theia and Intillia to give you the strength of forgiveness and reconciliation, so that both you great men may make Peace.”

Okin couldn’t even bare to look at Mulos or the rest of the crowd, lest he light up in a rage. 

Several seconds passed, and he could just imagine all the Athers staring at him, thinking he had gone mad.

“Okin, please,” Mulos said.

Okin looked up at Aldwin. He almost definitely *did* look like a madman now, with his neck shaking. But the Truth--- it had to be known. 

“Tell them Aldwin! It’s over now! Tell them the Truth!”

He heard Mulos’ pleading in the background, he even saw him out of the corner of his eye, but it was all unintelligible. His face grew red and his veins and his jaw trembled with every increasing shout.

“How can you call yourself a Dedicant of Aredal? Tell them, Aldwin! Tell them!”

Mulos shook his head in regret. He got the attention of the Rothars standing adjacent to the pillars at the far sides of the aisle and motioned with his neck to Okin.

“How can you just stand up there, talking normally, when you know you have never been honest to anyone?”

The metal clanging of the Rothars encroached him from both sides.

That you, who preach as perhaps the *leader* of Truth, Justice, and Bravery in this world, hide secrets in the shadows?”  
	 Okin stared down his former mentor. Aldwin’s expression was indistinguishable to the shocked crowd, and that boiled his veins.

“What would your *son* think?”

There, *there* was a flash--- ever so sudden and then gone--- of guilt.

The Rothars each grabbed Okin’s arms with heavy metal fists. He did not budge. He knew they would only use force with an Ather when *absolutely* neccesary.

And he needed to get all out to Aldwin, he needed to see the guilt on his face even for just a second more.

“How can you stand there, lying to everyone? Lying to him? Lying to *me*?”

With that, the Rothars started to drag him. Primal words, more like gusts of wind, continued to escape his lips. They left his mind as soon as they left his mouth. The fearful faces of the other Athers faded into pale peach lights; the rows of pews became a sea of brown, the engravings on the walls and even the stone pillars all blurred into a massive, grey canvas. 

He stared at the wide hall of the church, details disappearing as he was dragged farther, until it was only brown, grey, and the fog of his heavy breath.

He sat with that for what seemed like minutes.

“Ather!” There was a cold touch on his cheek, and he flinched back to reality.

It was the hand of the Rothar. His face was shielded by that circular helmet, only a thin V around his eye-line.

“Are you alright, High Ather? You’re not going to enter the Cathedral again until the ceremony is over, right?”

Okin shot the Rothar daggers; it was infuriating being talked down to like a child from someone younger and far less experienced. But his expression softened as he realized the man was only doing his job, and Okin probably did seem rather insane. 

“I will not. I apologize for any disturbance I may have caused you,” Okin said. He fully got back on his feet, and gave a meek smile.

The Rothar nodded to his fellow, and they both released their hands from his robe. They turned to walk back inside. 

Okin brushed off the wrinkles they had made at the shoulders. He glanced at the two other Rothars who stood in front of each pillar, fully unmoving. They actually appeared to be inhuman statues wearing those full face plates with only thin vertical slots.

That made it a little easier to release his rage in a childish stomp without feeling embarrassed.

He had taken the Arbiter of Truth’s advice, he had been upfront, he had been honest, and this was what was to gain? An embarrassment, a destruction of his reputation?

Ateon was right. Of course this way would just make him look a fool. And Aldwin’s dishonesty, his crystal clear Deception... even *Treachery*... it was unbelievable. The only thing that stopped Okin from marching back into that church and continuing his tirade was his conscience knowing that would be an action of Wrath, and against the wishes of all those inside.

But Aldwin had to come out eventually, and when he did, Okin would be ready. He would find the Truth.
