# Transportation

In both Manipulation and Force mode:
* The more surface area the easier it is to grip
* If something they grip is hit by another object, they lose grip
* The less mass, the faster you can move it
* Separating things that are fused is very difficult. It's mostly based on sight, and "the feel" of the invisible hand.
* They see the things the same and find the objects in
* The more parts a thing has the harder it is to move

- Manipulation mode: can move things accurately, at a set, not very fast maximum speed
- Force mode: push quickly at a constant force, in one direction

# Teleportation

Portals

Purple portal as an outline, circular, bridge between two points, you can see through the portal from one side to the other.

Portal cost is in the transportation of items, it scales linearly with mass, but exponentially with distance

Space realm is non-euclidian 4D-ish space that is made of the same material as the space artifact. When searching through the realm objects occur in order but no linearly, the user gets impressions of the area and uses them to place the portal in the real world. When someone enters a portal they are transported as data-ish entities to the poral exit.
