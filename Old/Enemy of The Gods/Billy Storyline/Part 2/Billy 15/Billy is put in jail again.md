*Ch-chkk.* The familiar iron click shook the bars, and Billy was in a cage again.

“Please, I’m telling you,” Billy slammed his hands against the bars. “I had no idea about---your customs!”

Beryl, the absolute coward, had been silent the whole walk back to the mountain, and then just dumped Billy off to some other sycophant, an ugly man with a red scar across his cheek that heavily contrasted from his pale skin. He didn’t wear the standard robes like the others, instead sporting a dark executioner’s unifor\[ Not sure if he’d know this\]m. The scarred man, completely ignoring Billy, shook the barred door back and forth, confirming it was locked. 

“How---you couldn’t have expected me to know how severe that crime was! I just got here!” 

Two other guards in the standard Monastery wear stood behind the jailer, following him as he turned to leave the room.

“Hey!” Billy tried to shake the bars, but they didn’t move. “It’s not fair! I never even asked to come to this cinking place!  I knew it! She lied! You all lied! You’re just like the rest of them snakes, just sprinkled with a whole bunch of crazy!"

Opening the double doors, the jailer turned back to the cell. His left eye, sclera larger than an orange, scrutinized Billy.

Then he and the two guards left, and the doors slammed shut.

Billy screamed his complaints some more before coming to the correct realization that no one was listening. Blood bursting in his head, he fell to the floor.

He tensed his jaw. That outburst probably cost him any chance at a reduced sentence. These kind of people would always find some slimy method to get their way, the only thing one could do was to stay polite, unnoticed, and out of their sight. Billy had squandered that again. He knew he should’ve never done the training, but Damian---

A violent rumble came from Billy’s throat, and the outlaw clawed at his cheek, squeezing until it reddened. He had promised himself that he would try for Damian. Did his brother know that he had hit another apprentice and cursed these people’s gods? 

*Maybe he doesn’t need you anymore,* Allia’s voice echoed within the bars. 

*Maybe, he’d even be better off without you,* a voice from within spoke back.

Billy slammed his fist on the concrete ground, digging a new scab into the side of his hand. A brutal shriek bounced around the small cage.
