The Aeroblaze is a giant radiation storm which destroyed a massive amount of the Vianaryan wildlife and landscape after the Versalist Gods destroyed an alien ship in the year 240 BA. The Aeroblaze was created due to the implosion of the ship’s engine.

It wiped out an amalgam of wildlife, terrain formations, and even tribes in the surrounding area. Much of Vianarya was left uninhabitable.

In the Age of Discovery (\~430 AA - 650AA), Terridian Imperialist Explorers discovered the continent of Vianarya, and though it was rather barren, marked it as a possible site for colonization. However, as more explorers and prospective set foot on the land, they found themselves bursting with dangerous diseases and mutations. Sometimes these would not show their effect until months after Vianaryan contact had actually been made, which actually further enhanced the negative image of the southern continents as explorers would return to their homelands in Wreathward and exhibit the effects of the deadly radiation instead of just dying in Vianarya for nobody to see. Quickly, word spread, and governments and The Citadel issued a decree for none to step foot onto the continents of Vianarya or Caspo, as they were cursed with an invisible disease. Scholars called this “Invisible Fire from the Air”, as those affected by the radiation would often display burnt-like skin. In most Trentanian-speaking circles, this eventually became known as the “Aeroblaze.”
