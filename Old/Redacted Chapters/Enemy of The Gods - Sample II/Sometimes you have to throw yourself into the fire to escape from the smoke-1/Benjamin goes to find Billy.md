Benjamin peered over the ship’s side, scanning for any sign of the two fools. He looked up and down the dock, his eyes weaving through crowds of sailors and noblemen. 

“Where the cink are they? Cannot follow simple instructions? Told them to be here at sunover, it’s almost night!”

Benjamin did a shoulder check as he heard steps from behind; it was the Captain. He turned his head back to the dock as if didn’t see him, tapping the side of the ship.

It was no use. The bearded man waddled over, giving him a big slap on the back. 

“Benjy, I know they’re your buddies, but we were supposed to disembark an hour ago. If they don’t show up soon, we may have to leave them behind,” the Captain said.

Pushing himself off the dock, Benjamin let out a huge exhale. The Captain looked up in shock as the towering, dark man stormed over to the platform that connected the ship and the dock. 

“Benjy, where are you going?” The Captain shouted, following the crewmate.

Not even turning to reply, Benjamin pushed through the large, blonde-bearded man as he left the ship and walked onto the platform. “Going to find Billy.”

“Benjamin, wait!” The Captain yelled, leaning over the side of the ship.  Benjamin shot a glare at the Captain, but softened his look to match the Captain’s surprisingly friendly eyes.

“I’m only doing this because you’re a good guy, Benjy, and so am I, or so I’d like to think. Any normal cap’n would leave ya here right now, or force his crew to pull ya on onboard, ’though I know we couldn’t do that one,” the Captain said, smiling. “You go find your friends, but Benjy. Be back before sundown, or I’m sorry, we’ll have to leave ya behind.”

Benjamin gave an affirmative nod, and then his eyes refocused, determined.  He turned away from the ship, speeding his march to a run, pushing past both sailors and noblemen.

He would find his friends, and he would do it in time.
