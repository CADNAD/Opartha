Allia stepped into the centre of the circular chamber, where she was observed from all sides. In front of her, a woman rose from her throne-like seat. She appeared to be Farsunian, with wrinkled brown skin and a regal face. The woman wore her hair in an intricate thatched braid, which lay over her right shoulder. As she stood, golden bracelets rattled against each other. The old woman wore a soft maroon dress which clung to her and gave a sense of regality., unmatched by any other. The rest of the Dakungs wore the same uniforms that Avador and Evelyn had both sported, save for one man who sat shirtless to the rightside of the room. 

“Ah, Allia. So you have returned,” she said. From atop her elevated stand, she peered down at Allia, who quickly dropped down to one knee.

“Dakungs, I present three candidates to you. I am... unsure of their power, but I do believe all two, if not all three, to be gifted.” 

“I trust that you would not bring them if they were not,” around her, the other four Dakungs nodded in agreement. 

The woman turned her eyes from Allia and to the wall where Billy, Damian, and Benjamin leaned. “Tell me, who has Allia brought to us this day?” 

“Why do you need to know?” Billy said. 

To his side Avador growled a whisper, “Just tell her your name, kid.” 

The woman held out a hand towards Avador silencing the man. “It’s okay, Chowondo. It’s rare to have one refuse simple formalities like this, but it is telling.”

Telling? All that was telling was the size of the stick she had up her ass.

“With all due respect ma’am, why not introduce yourself first?”  Billy asked.

The woman smiled, as she stifled a chuckle. “A reasonable enough request. I am Dakung Amadura. You are?”

“What about the rest of them?” Billy spun his finger in a circle around the room gesturing at the remaining four Dakungs. 

“If they feel so inclined to respond, they will so themselves. I command no authority over them.” Amadura looked around at her companions. 

The first to respond was the shirtless man to her right. His outfit seemed to be the standard uniform but torn in half at the waist. In his sixties with short grey hair and equally grey stubble, the man looked Delmian, based on his thin eyes and dark skin. 

“I am Dakung Taedon,” the man said in a voice which matched his gruff appearance. 

The next to speak was a wiry man with tan skin and wide brown eyes. The man had barely any hair on his ovular face, leaving it like freshly trimmed grass atop his head. 

“Dakung Herlo, it‘s nice to make your acquaintance.” His voice was clipped, and his movements stiff in his navy blue uniform. 

On the left, a young Beisanian--- identifiable sparkling white hair and thin, white eyes, spoke. “I am Dakung Zu-lou,” she said. Despite looking only a little older than twenty, she spoke with a commanding tone, steely conviction.

Finally, the last Dakung stood. His clothing more worn than the others, with faded blues and frayed embroidery. Billy placed his age around thirty, but it was hard to tell his exactly based on the gauntness in his face. Looking into his eyes Billy saw an all too familiar emptiness.

“I am Dakung Tanero. I am glad that you have agreed to come to us.” 

Amadura nodded thanks to her fellow Dakungs before gesturing to the three at the back of the room, “So, now that that is over, may we be graced with your names?” 

Damian glanced to Billy waiting his decision, “Yeah, the name’s Billy.” 

“And what of a...” The woman narrowed her eyes an eyebrow raised, “house name?” 

“Gruissem,” he said bluntly. 

She nodded and gestured to Damian, “ah, I’m Damian, Ma’am. Damian...” 

The teen searched for an answer before Billy interjected, “he’s a Gruissem.” 

“Billy?” Damian whispered. 

“He’s a Gruissem.” Billy said, more firmly. Damian’s face was shrouded in equals parts by embarrassment and comfort. But, he was Billy’s brother, no matter what he felt. 

“Benjamin,” the buff man lazily pointed a finger to himself, a gesture which amused Zu-lou and Taedon. 

“Just Benjamin?” Zu-lou leaned forwards in her seat.

“Just Benjamin.” 

“Well then, we welcome you to Banuro, and by extension Meridaz.” Amadura spread her arms apart, as if to give a hug. “Allia has brought you here as candidates, are you aware what that entails?” 

“Nah, Allia told us jack.” Amadura frowned at what Billy said. 

“Unfortunate, nonetheless, I shall explain. Are you aware of the Order of Tsuman, of what we are?” 

“You cultivate the strongest of all Heralds, training them.” Damian said. Billy hoped he was right, the last thing he wanted to do now was seem like an idiot. 

The old woman nodded slowly, “Indeed. However, we do not only count the strongest amongst our ranks, all Heralds are welcome.”

“And non-heralds?” Billy said

“They are welcome at Meridaz, and may serve us, but they the Order of Tsuman is created for Heralds specifically.”

“And what do we get for joining?” Billy took a step forwards off the wall. 

Amadura smiled and clasped her hands together. “If you did not want something, you would not have come with Allia, especially if she didn’t explain what our goals are. So Mr. Gruissem, what did she promise you? Power? Safety? Wealth? Well, whatever it is, we can provide, so long as you are gifted by the Forces.” 

“Well, that’s the problem. She didn’t promise us much of anything. Nothing specific at least,” Billy took another step forwards and he could see Allia glance back at him with a pleading expression. *Look who’s in control now*, he couldn’t help but think. 

“So tell me again, what is it you want?” Amadura brought her clasped hands to rest below her chin, leaning forward. 

“Well, what can you offer me?” Billy asked.

“Anything on Meridaz, anything from any corner of the world, nearly anything you want can be yours so long as you join us. Assuming you are worthy in the first place.” 

Billy took a few more steps forwards and found himself of the five pointed star shape imbedded into the floor. “Well, what does joining you mean?” 

“A better life, one with purpose and meaning.” Amadura said.

A life of people telling him what to think, and what to feel, and how to act.  Not exactly what he had wanted. It seemed Amadura was another old, out of touch woman. “What exactly does that mean?”

“At the Order of Tsuman we, as your friend said, cultivate the powers of Heralds. We train them to fully harness the gift  they have been bestowed by the Forces.”

“And why would I want that?” Billy took another step forward to stand recently aside  Allia.

“Why would you train to cultivate your gift?” Amadura raised an eyebrow, smirking. “For power in this life, and for service beyond. To serve a greater mission than your own life. To matter.” 

“I’ll join,” Damian said suddenly. Billy whipped around, watching as the teen scrambled towards the centre of the star. “I’ll join, I want to be part of your Order.” 

Billy grabbed his friend by the arm and jerked him out of the centre. “Damian, what the cink are you on!” 

Damian slouched, and his eyes darted to the floor. “I just... isn’t this what you wanted Billy? To be a part of something, to do good?” 

*Doing good*, something deep within Billy was grabbed by the idea. It seized a part of him he thought long buried, a part of him he thought died on that night alongside his father. 

“I do, but this isn’t the way to do that Damian,” Billy gripped his brother harder. “How do you know they’re right? How do you know helping them will even be doing any good?” 

“I...” Damian jerked his head away, “I don’t. I just, feel it.” 

“Will go,” Benjamin stepped off the wall and began towards the centre. “If train me, then I accept.” 

Amadura smiled, a soft, condescending smile. “Two of you is sufficient for now. Mr. Gruissem, you are permitted to stay with them at no extra expense as you appear to be a relative of some sort. I’m sure you will come around, eventually.” 

Allia breathed a sigh of relief. *You might not have lied, but you didn’t exactly promise this either.* Billy turned his annoyance from Allia to Amadura. The older woman was descending the steps in front of her seat. Her dress flowed artfully with each delicate step. 

“While it is all well and good that you would like to join us, I must ensure that you are all gifted by the Forces.” She took a final step onto the floor and strode towards the centre. She elegantly flipped her hand over, and proffered it to Billy. 

“Please, place your hand here. It’s just the simple request of an old woman,” Amadura cocked her head and gave him an unnervingly motherly smile. 

Billy was hesitant, but seeing the hope in his friend’s eyes eyes, he followed. Billy placed his hands lightly ontop of Amadura’s.  A low rumbling rippled across his body. He could hear Amadura’s voice in his mind, her thoughts mixing- overriding -his own. Her very essence smothered him in his own mind. Then it was over. All of that, in the blink of an eye. Billy jerked his hand away, cold sweat coalescing on his face. 

Amadura looked satisfied as she scanned Billy once over, “You have quite the potential. Shame you won’t join us.” 

She turned and offered her hands to Benjamin who took them without aversion. Billy lunged to stop him, but it was too late. Benjamin pulled his hand away and Billy could see the drops of sweat forming on his face. 

A satisfied smile formed on the old women’s face “how truly blessed you are.” Amadura looked down at Allia who was still bent over kneeling. “You should be proud, Allia. Of course, we could expect nothing less from you.” The woman smiled.

“Thank you Dakung, it is an honour the Forces gifted me with such a boon.” 

“Don’t be like that child, the Forces only provide for us so much. The rest we must take ourselves, you have done well in seizing the opportunities presented to you.” 

Allia nodded silently, and Amadura moved along the line, to Damian. Billy lunged again, but was pulled back by Benjamin. 

“*Cink* man, what are you doing?” Billy grunted forcefully. 

“He make decision, you stay.” Benjamin twisted his arm, pinning Billy to his body. Was he crazy? Why was he the only one in the *Cinking* place who could see that none of this was right. That this was all too easy, all too good. He had heard of these type of terrorists and extremist groups before. The nicer the outside, the more rotten its core. 

Damian, hovered his hand above Amadura’s palm. For a moment, Billy thought the boy might have reconsidered his choice before Amadura spoke, “It is ok child. I will not hurt you, that much I promise.” 

“What if I’m not worthy?” Damian said.

“We will still find you a place. Your friends alone have secured you a place within our ranks.” Damian seemed hesitant still, yet he took her palm. Damian flinched but the woman had no reaction. She held his hand for worlds longer then she did either of the other two. Around them, each Dakung leaned in slowly.

“Amadura?” Taedon, the gruff man inquired, “what is it?” 

Slowly she removed her hand from Damian, eyes blinking wide in confusion. “I feel nothing from him.” 

“Then he is simply not blessed, what is there to linger on?” Zu-lou slumped back relaxing in her seat, the matter seemingly resolved. But Amadura shook her head. 

“Even amongst humans I can feel something, but him...” A shudder ran down body jingling the golden bands and ornate jewelry. “A total blank slate.” 

Damian, wide eyed, snapped to Billy. The older man simply shrugged. If they didn’t see him as gifted, then maybe they’d leave him alone, leave his mind unaltered. 

“Strange indeed,” Taedon folded two heavy hands over each other. “No matter, the boy is earnest, and the other two seem quite gifted. I see no reason to turn them away. Avador, please escort them to suitable accommodations.” 

“Right away,” stepping away from the wall Avador gave each Dakung a deep bow with his eyes to the ground. That blind spot would get him killed one day. Rising from his final bow he gestured the three over, leaving Allia in the centre of the room. 

“You best be quick, I don’t got much time to waste today.”  Billy followed,  shooting a silent look over his shoulder at Allia as the antechambers door slammed shut behind him.
