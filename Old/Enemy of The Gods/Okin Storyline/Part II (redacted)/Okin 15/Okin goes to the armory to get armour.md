“Why do you need me to come?” Gendro whined.

Okin jammed the key into the hole and opened the large wooden door to the armoury.

“Because you know more about this than I do. And we both know it’s not like you wanted to do those drills anyway,” Okin replied.

“You’re right,” the Rothar smiled, stepping into the room and slamming the massive door shut behind them.

Gendro sat down on the floor, opening his leather knapsack while Okin darted over to the rows of armour stands, placing his own satchel down carefully on the floor.

Taking off one of the metallic helmets, his hands shook when he placed it on his head. There were lots of gaps and spots where his head jutted out uncomfortably, squeezing into the hard steel. He slid down the circular visor which radically narrowed his peripherals; it had only one thin slit for the eyes.

But it was the right one. This way, even from speaking distance, his face was imperceptible. He put on the rest of the armour.

“How do *you* wear this all day without complaining?” Okin asked.  

Gendro laughed, fiddling with the Light Crystal he had pulled out of his bag. “I don’t. Why do you think I volunteered to become a serving\[ 2021-02-26, 2:08 PM

May change this term later\] Rothar? So I don’t have to wear that annoying bulky thing all day, or ever.”

Okin struggled to turn around. With every step he had to heave his hips up and around in a strange motion. For once, Gendro wasn’t just being a hyperbolic bellyacher.

The Ather pulled up the hefty visor and stared his blue eyes down at his friend, who was now digging into the bag again like a child who was left with their father’s possessions.

“Surely there are more reasons than that, Gendro,” Okin said. “I bet you find Joy in finding an unsuspecting victim like myself who you can subject to your unrelenting guff but who doesn’t have the determination to punish you for it like a commanding Devinar would.” Gendro smiled.

“You have a knack for stating the obvious in unnecessarily complex ways,” the Rothar said. “But yes, you are right in one sense, I do have ulterior motives. I find on a battlefield, or worse, just mindlessly guarding a town and then tackling some drunkard every few weeks, there is no originality or experience. Nexon is the God of Joy and Gratitude, and there is little of either to be had from being a grain of sand battling against the ocean, or a drop of water sieging an endless beach. I prefer to make a stark difference in one man’s life then a marginal difference in something far beyond me.”

Okin’s thin lips curled into a warm smile. Days ago he would have denied this statement, but now it was technically true; Gendro had made an extremely stark difference in Okin’s life: without the Rothar it would be no more. Was Gendro really lacking in his duties and Dedication, or did he genuinely believe his thesis that he was expressing his Dedication in not only unique way, but in a way greater than the typical?

“And I thought *I* was the one who had a knack for stating the obvious  unnecessarily complex ways,” Okin said. 

Gendro chuckled. “Okin, you continue assure me that I have made the right decision\[ 2021-02-26, 2:55 PM

Connect this to when Gendro rejects OKin and is surprised by his lies\].”

The Rothar began digging again, pulling out a small black leather pouch from within the larger satchel.

“Are we ever going to use this strange Apathasawian currency? Is there some place we can go to exchange this? It must be worth something, the Apathasawians are supposed to be rich, are they not?” Gendro shook his head, smiling. “It’s so fascinating, how different people from different lands are from us, or moreover, how much a people change after a few hundred years. The Apathasawians--- many of them were originally Trentanians, right? Oh, but they are so different. And how it must have been for one to settle in a land, in a society so different.

“You told me, on the ride here, that you used to know Billy Gruissem, and that, uhm, Damian as well. Did you always know it would end up this way? That--- that they would become like this?”

Okin looked down, shaking his head. “They were just two normal kids, good kids even. I still remember watching over them as they played.” The Ather cracked a smile. “Or admittedly, often playing along with them.”

“Do you think--- there’s any possibility that what they said was true? About the Synodontis? That they’re innocent?” Gendro asked.

Okin sighed. Billy’s still surprising return had taken a backseat in his mind. “I---to be honest, I have no idea, Gendro. As you said--- it’s shocking how much people can change in time.”

Gendro nodded, placing the coins back in his pouch, fiddling around for whatever else was still left in there.
