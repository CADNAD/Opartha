Okin waited behind the massive wooden door of the garrison, peeking out onto the street every once in a while. After a couple hours, he stopped doing that, instead just opting to sit patiently against the door.

Previa said he would come. Okin told him to be there at the ninth hour, although he had started waiting hours before that. He should have known that Previa was more likely to be late than early, in fact part of him did well know, but he waited early anyway. He hadn’t even had time to settle down, and was still wearing the iron-clad metal suit of a Rothar, and had his satchel slung over his back.

Now it was several minutes past. But Okin would stay all night. This was his last hope in making the election Just, in destroying the corruption of The Citadel, and of finally discovering the Truth.

Every time the sound of thunder boomed, Okin would turn around, and check. Once again, there was no one.

The Ather sighed, shutting the door quickly to prevent the cold air from coming in again. He slumped down against the wood, his neck hanging down to the floor.

There was a creak, and his head popped up. But it wasn’t from outside, rather within.

On the stone staircase leading upwards to the dorms, Gendro was crouched, wearing his plain cloth pajamas.

Okin stood up, waving his hand dismissively. “Gendro, go back to sleep.”

“What are you doing Okin? Why aren’t you in bed?” The Rothar asked, continuing to sneak down the steps.

“Now is not the time to explain. Go back to sleep, please,” Okin said.

“We are supposed to be a team, but you always keep pushing me away. That day with those masked men---you still haven’t even told me what that was, and now you’re sneaking around at night. I’m concerned for your safety, Okin, and not just because it’s my job, we both know I don’t care about that!” The usual joking tone was absent from Gendro’s voice, and his eyes were red and watering. “Just tell me, just *actually* tell me, what is going on, Okin?”

Okin froze; there was a knock on the door behind him. Gendro kept coming down, his face breaking down further with every step.

“Gendro, please, go. I will tell you everything in the morning,” Okin said.  

Gendro shook his head, biting his lip, and continued to descend towards the Ather. There was another knock on the door.

“It’s always ‘tomorrow’, or ‘another step’, or ‘now is not a good time’ with you! Why can’t you just tell me? All I want to do is help!” 

“I-I can’t,” Okin said, placing his hand against the door. “This burden--- it’s not for you.”

“This burden--- is not for me?!” A deep red grew out from Gendro’s neck to his head. “Can’t you see how much all the secrets you keep is hurting me! This---this isn’t about me! This is about you!”

There was a final knock on the door, shaking it and Okin’s body, which further pressed against it, shying away from Gendro’s pointed finger. The High Ather’s hand slipped down onto the door’s lock, and the door swung open onto the street. Okin grabbed a hand onto Gendro’s shoulder to prevent himself from falling backwards onto the newcomer.

Okin looked to the entryway, releasing Gendro. Previa had come, as promised. 

But he was not alone.

On the blackened road, torches flickering in the rain, were a small squad of iron-fisted Rothars, led by a Devinar in glistening white and blue armour.  In between the Rothars, hands tied behind his back, Trenton, disposed of his purple cap and pelligrina, glared at Okin.

But the soul-crushing sight was a sweet chocolate compared to the slight, satisfied grin of Aldwin.

The Devinar stepped forward first, next to Previa, who stood emotionless in the doorway.

“High Ather Okin, Rothar Gendro. You are both under arrest for assault of an Ather of The Citadel, attempted coercion, and collusion in attempt to meddle in an election. Remove your armour and all your belongings, and then place your arms behind your back and step forward.”

The Rothars flooded into the room, and Gendro’s wrath turned into horror. 

“Okin,” Gendro said with wide eyes. “What have you done?”

Okin’s eyes didn’t meet Gendro’s, but instead focused on Previa, who stared back, still unmoving in the doorway, watching calmly as the Rothars moved in to surround Okin and Gendro,

“It wasn’t me,” Okin said to Gendro before turning to Previa. “Previa---why? Why?!”

“You---,” Previa started. “You’ve only ever seen me as two things. A child---and then a tool. You never really wanted to support me. I’ve never had a chance to do anything great. I didn’t *ask* for this, Okin, but I accepted it. But as soon as *you* found out I had even a chance of becoming an Impalias, you did everything you could to stop it, because you’re really just envious.  You *lied*, Okin. You lied to my face!

“Now do as you’ve been commanded and take off that armour.”

Okin shook, sliding off the metal boots and leggings. The Rothars surrounded and cuffed a squirming Gendro, and Okin unclipped his breastplate, his hands shaking as he threw his satchel on the ground.

As soon as he was just in his grey undergarments, the Rothars, wearing the same armour that he had just tossed to the ground, surrounded him, grabbing his arms forcefully and restraining them. A few of the others picked up his armour and satchel off the floor.

Okin’s body fell limp as the guards pushed him and Gendro out the door. 

“It’s not me that’s lying to you! “It’s him!” Okin shouted at Previa, throwing his chin toward Aldwin.

Previa spat on Okin’s face. 

“I didn’t think you’d sink so low \[ 2021-03-28, 2:00 PM

Expand on this\]to continue trying to separate me from my father,” Previa said. “You chastise me for speaking of the likes of Deionis and Tregale, yet you embody them.”

Okin sheepishly looked to Gendro, his Rothar’s face was red, and he looked like a raging bull being held back by several men.

“I’m glad to know you lie to all of your friends, not just me,” the Rothar said as their eyes met.

Okin just turned away from his friends, hanging his head low to the ground. His eyes filled with tears, and he tried to squeeze them out.

And finally, he spoke the Truth.

“Previa---it’s not that I don’t want you to succeed. There is something going on, something controlling The Citadel, but yes, you are right, it’s not just that. I just---I didn’t think you were ready.”

Okin closed his eyes, bracing himself for another fickle of spit or even a kick to the ribs. But Previa just stayed silent.
