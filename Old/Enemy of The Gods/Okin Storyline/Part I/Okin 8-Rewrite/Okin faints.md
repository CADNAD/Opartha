Okin moved the curtain aside to get a good peek at the street. Still empty. It seemed like hours since he last looked, but it was probably only a few minutes.

He checked his robes for any dandruff. He couldn’t see any, but he brushed his shoulders anyway. 

He looked back out to the grey streets. A small movement caught his attention.

Yes, finally. It was a baker unlocking his door and flipping the open sign. Life was back in the city!

Soon enough, more people came pouring out onto the streets. It was about time he’d join them.

Straightening his collar, Okin grabbed his Ather’s satchel and opened the door. His head wobbled a little as he made his way out into the hall. He forcefully straightened his back to quell the headache.

That got him about eight steps.
