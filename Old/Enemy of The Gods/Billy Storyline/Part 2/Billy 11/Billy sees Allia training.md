Billy scratched his head, watching people pass from just outside the training room. He didn’t really have anything to do besides go back to his room and keep, well... drinking. Part of him wanted to go see Damian train, although he had no idea where his brother was and didn’t want to ask one of those crazies in the hall.

Plus, he had plenty of time, and no one could see him just peeking through the curtains. He was also a *little* curious about seeing the other Heraldries. Although he was plenty experienced being a Control Herald, like most people, he hadn’t been able to witness many Heraldries, or at least anything remarkable. 

There was some pretty cool stuff, but Billy got the idea after a few minutes usually, and many of the rooms were empty\[ Unsure what this means\]. Still no sign of Damian, or any of the Dark Heraldries for that matter. Must’ve been at the other end of the corridor, or maybe he already passed them.

There was a brutish grunt sounding from inside the room before Billy peaked through. He sneaked in on his tiptoes, ducking underneath the curtains. His mouth hung open seeing who was inside. 

Allia’s hair was tied up in a messy bun, and she wore a fighting tunic, with the sleeves exposed, showing arms with deep red marks.  Standing across fromher, Taedon held a staff that was easily as long as he was tall. With a silent impassive face he lunged at the girl.

There was no space between attacks like during Benjamin’s training, and Allia’s master struck at her with intense force. The girl’s head came within inches of the swift attacks, and several times she let out a violent scream after blocking the staff with a hand or an arm.

Billy cringed. To his knowledge, the girl was just a Radiation Herald, not an Absorption Herald. Taking those attacks would hurt as much as it would for anyone, and it wouldn’t be easier to recover from.

The girl jumped back, avoiding Taedon’s wide sweeps.

Taedon paused, whipping the staff around his back so it stood atop his palm. \[ Confused about the actions here\]

“You do not strike me when there are openings, Allia. How else do you expect to take down an enemy?” \[ Confused about the actions here\]

Allia grunted, giving a quick nod and charging back towards her master, swiping past a strike directly at her stomach.\[ Confused about the actions here\]

Taedon spun around in a whirlwind of fury, his bare foot connecting with Allia’s chest and sending her flying backwards. She screamed in agony, and Billy had to look away.

After he lifted up his hands to peek back, she was already off the floor, panting, shaking fists guarding her face from Taedon, who stood at the other end of the room.

“Don’t be a *fool*, Allia! How do expect to charge in and face an Absorption Herald in close combat? That situation heavily favours him. Use your advantage.”

Allia’s chest rose up and down, brutal hacks escaping through her rapid breaths. Her hands continued to stay guarding her face.

“Hit me, Allia!” Taedon screamed.

Billy thought she was going to collapse, but instead, Allia flared her teeth, spinning around and crossing both arms. She threw out her hands after doing a full 180, and a beam of light grew out of both hand, creating a laser X. Billy’s heart pounded, his mouth opened in horror and his mind released a nostalgic flash of doom.\[ Nostalgic is weird here\]

He instinctively shut his eyes tight, suppressing the image. There was a shriek, Though if it were from his own mind, or from Taedon, Billy couldn’t tell. Opening his eyes, the quick flash of blinding light from Allia was gone. Both lines had blown into Taedon’s hips from opposite sides, burning through his tunic. Black char cut an X across his chest, and the smell of the burning flesh overwhelmed Billy’s sense. Taedon was had fallen onto the floor, clutching his sides.

Allia’s eyes widened and she ran over to her master’s side.

“Idiot girl! This is just training, you have *no* control!” Taedon winced, struggling to get up. “Let’s see if your other abilities are just as sloppy. Heal me.”

Allia’s eyes held back tears, and she raised her hands again, her lip wavering. She pressed them to the blackened patches, but not light flowed through her. 

“Bah, useless!” Taedon grabbed his staff of the floor and hit Allia in the face. The red marks on his sides disappeared as he stood up, and the girl rubbed the new mark on her face.

“You are rusty, Allia. It was all that time outside, squandered. Still, you do have great potential. I’m happy you finally saw the light.”

“Yes, master. I will continue to give my all to serve the Forces,” Allia bowed to her master, her face still flushed and wet.

Heart racing, Billy blew out of the room, creating a loud flap with the cloth draping. By the time Allia looked back, he was gone.
