Gendro ran towards Okin, lifting his lantern above the heads of the passerby’s.

“Okin, Okin!” he shouted.

Okin turned onto the road and waved his own lantern at Gendro. The Rothar increased his already nervous pace.

“Did you find anything of use?” Okin asked.

“No, nothing,” Gendro replied.

Okin nodded and continued his face-paced strut forward. “As expected from the perhaps the most curated and well-known library in Opartha. Of course a conspiracy of this magnitude wouldn’t be left out in the open.”

“It became clear that there was no such thing, so I started to look at titles even somewhat similar,” Gendro went on. “I must’ve opened and read the first page of a hundred books, but if even if this Fourth Book is among them under another name, we’ll be dead by the time we find it.”

Okin nodded. The Cathedral Ere Revictus might’ve had a million unique books.

“I couldn’t really get help, either, of course, without sounding like a complete heretic,” Gendro said. 

Gendro had taken to this crazy mission rather quickly. The Ather wasn’t exactly sure Gendro entirely even believed it, though. No matter. It was a Rothar’s duty to help his Ather at all cost, unless the actions required clearly betrayed his Dedication or The Citadel.  There wasn’t anything desiccating Nexon’s values of Selflessness, Gratitude, and Joy so far, but Treachery against The Citadel... well, that was at least debatable.

“How was it at the Cathedral?” Gendro asked.

“Aldwin... he lied to me again, and to dozens of Athers. And he admitted it to my face, and had the *audacity* to tell me to stop pursuing him,” Okin shook his head and sped up his strut.

“Well--- as crazy as all this is, I believe you, Okin.  But when are you going to tell me where you--- got on to this wild conspiracy?” Gendro asked. “And where are you taking us now, at this hour?”

Okin couldn’t help but smirk a little, though he kept up that determined stare.

“To show you where I got on to this wild conspiracy.”
