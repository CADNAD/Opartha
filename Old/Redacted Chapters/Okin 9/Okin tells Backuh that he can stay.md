The thin street was still deserted in the morning. Okin did a couple shoulder-checks to make sure he was not being followed, and then approached the gap in the two abandoned buildings.

The covered lump was now backed up much deeper into the gap, his body still covered by the shadow of one of the houses. Did the beggar ever get any sunlight at all?

“Hello,” Okin shouted into the space. Out from underneath the blanket, a wrinkled hand peeked out and motioned for him to move closer.

Okin checked the alley again; still no one. He then stepped into the crevice. 

The vagrant pulled the dirty blanket off his body, smiling. “Hello, High Ather Okin!”

Okin winced at the man’s yellow, chipped teeth. “Hello. I come with good news. I have found a way to keep myself here in The Citadel without any risk.”

The beggar raised an eyebrow. “And how might’ve you done that?”

Okin paused.\[ comma, 2021-05-17 7:22 PM

Change this stuff: Backuh already knows about how Okin got it done\] Coercing a high-ranking member of The Citadel, especially one as high as an Impalias, in order to avoid the orders of *another* Impalias, would be an act looked down upon by any religious man. Yet, Okin had the feeling it wouldn’t change anything in the eyes of the beggar. He had lied enough, why lie about something to a man this low, who kept so many a secret from him?

“I convinced Impalias Trenton to order me to stay here. By technicality, I should be taking orders from him anyway,” Okin said. “I’m just happy I won’t be having to do any more sneaking around.”

The homeless man cackled. “Oh, the sneaking is just getting started!”

Okin’s jaw dropped. “What do you mean? I purposefully did this so I wouldn’t have to watch my back, so I wouldn’t have to *lie* anymore!”

“Well, there are many more powerful than you and I that do not want us to get our hands on the secrets which you wish to find,” the man said. “You have already taken a great first step in befriending an Impalias. It would be a travesty to see you give up now, but if you are afraid of sneaking around, then I am afraid that there is no way forward.”

A sharp exhale escaped Okin’s nose. “What exactly do you mean by *sneaking around*?”

The man laughed, pointing a finger at Okin. “Ah, I love that. You put on a cautious face, but inside, you really have the desire for adventure, for excitement.”

Okin frowned. *Adventure? Excitement? I desire none of these shallow things! The only reason I am still talking to this strange vagrant is because he obviously holds the key to secrets I do not understand, and my wish to complete this knowledge has little to do with my own personal enjoyment, but with the fate of my faith and all religious men!*

Okin eyed the beggar, edging him to continue. The beggar’s impish smile returned.

“There is knowledge,” he said. “Hidden knowledge, that concerns the very origins of The Citadel. You might’ve went looking in Olitheon’s Cathedral, but why would they hide their secrets in a place available to every curious little creature like yourself? No, the only way you can find these secrets is by marching into the households of the men who hold them.”

Okin bit his lip, struggling to hide his surprise. How had the man known he’d gone to the library? It must’ve just been the obvious guess, he knew Okin was inquisitive, and he knew that Okin likely wouldn’t instantly trust anything given to him by a random street bum. But moreover, what did he mean by *marching into the households of the men who hold them*? Okin was no thief--- he was about the farthest thing from it. What did this strange beggar expect of him?

The old man continued. “The next time you come near a member of the clergy, one of your fellow Athers or even an Impalias, attempt to access his mind. Stay near him, get a hand on him, and think about what he might be hiding from you. Try to feel out any secrets which he might be keeping from the world. You will find much more than you expect.”

*What? So he wants me to just speak with random clergymen, and try to extract information from them? How is this going to be an effective strategy?*  There were hundreds of Athers in The Citadel alone, and who knew who had the information, and even worse, why would any of them ever let it slip?

Turning away from the vagabond, Okin shook his head. “What am I even looking for?”

“You are looking for an opening. A gap which you can hook onto, the small hole in the wall that will lead into a room full of the answers to all of your questions.”

The man’s vague talk was just getting annoying. The mission didn’t seem impossible--- for something to be considered impossible, you had to know what your goal *was.* No, this mission was worse than impossible--- it was completely hidden. 

But, what else did Okin have? He had already ruled out returning to Ariska--- he couldn’t continue his normal life knowing that there was more to his faith than that which was told to the world. He had to discover it some way or another--- and this mysterious, dirty beggar was the only one who had offered any sort of path forward.

“Alright. And who should I target to find this opening?”

The old man smiled. “You should target those closest to you first, those you know. They are the easiest to approach, and then you can rule them out first.”

*Those I know...* Of all the clergymen Okin knew, there were only three in The Citadel at the moment. Previa, Aldwin, and Trenton. Previa--- he was too naive and stupid to hide any secrets. Trenton--- he was high up, but it didn’t seem likely. But Aldwin... Aldwin was the one who had confirmed the existence of the Fourth Book of Nexon, he was the one who had uncharacteristically supported Previa in becoming an Impalias, he was the one who had recently been acting very strangely--- almost suspiciously.

“I know who I need to target,” Okin said, turning on a sharp heel away from the beggar. He heard the gust of wind as the man covered himself with the blanket again. The High Ather marched out of the thin opening, not even caring to look out for other Athers or Rothars. 

Yes, Okin would find out if, or more likely what, Aldwin was hiding. He couldn’t approach the Impalias directly--- Aldwin wouldn’t even want to talk after Okin had so obviously disobeyed his command. But Okin already *had* an opening when it came to Aldwin--- his childish, ignorant son. Through the crevice, Okin would find what he was looking for. Not just the secrets of The Citadel, but the true mystery that had led Okin here in the first place.

The mystery of Billy.
