Billy and Damian had descended from the upper deck. The crew looked to be tripping over each other. From all their shouting and running, it looked as if they were fighting against a violent storm, not mooring a ship in peaceful waters.

“Slow the engines!” The captain, a tall man with a black bushy beard, yelled. “Cut the sails, Silvio! How many damn times do we have to do this same *cinking* thing before you hogwheels get it right?”

Billy snorted; at least he wasn’t the only one who thought these guys were idiots.

“Move it! Why are you so slow?” The captain shouted at a large blonde man with skin whiter than the bone. “Is it because of all the booze y’all been drinking? Aredal, maybe that deal with Behousee does more harm than good. Then again, that’s probably the reason why half of you fatsos want to crew here!”

Billy raised an eyebrow. *A deal with Behousee Brews and* _Spirits? Perhaps_ that was why Benjamin had been so willing to pay Billy in beer. And of course, Billy played right into his hand.

Maneuvering in and out of the dock were a multitude of boats which contained wide variety among them. There was only one other vessel even close to the size of Benjamin’s crew’s frigate, and likewise it was well-maintained and likely a steam-sail hybrid.  There were many other ships that Billy vaguely recognized from his childhood, smaller and entirely powered by sail. 

A trio of ever-familiar identical ships, all with three central masts were departing from the dock just ahead of where theirs was entering. Billy hadn’t done any nautical research since arriving in Apathasaw, as they never really traveled by sea anymore, and it wasn’t required. But he *knew* that those the medium-sized ships with three masts were either barques or brigs. For some reason, the fact that he had forgotten itched at his skin. He closed his eyes and tried to remember.

Out of the darkness, a little white hand, *his* hand, followed a longer, calloused finger along several sketches that detailed an identical three-mast vessel being built over five steps. The larger hand pointed to giant letters printed at the top of the diagram, which read CONSTRUCTION OF A BARQUE --- FOUNDATION TO COMPLETION. The little boy tilted his head up from the man’s hand--- 

Billy shook his head and bulged his eyes open as wide as possible. The separated planks of the deck blurred into one mahogany square.

His neck jerked up when he heard the crash of the ship’s plank being propped onto the dock. Benjamin was there, arms extended, using his Heraldry to make the process easier and ensure the plank didn’t collapse into the waters below between the ship and the platform. Behind the descending plank was a long view into the town square with carriages, houses, and townsfolk along the way.

Billy turned away from the newfound view before his eyes could really grasp it. 

“Wow,” Damian said from behind. “I forgot how much more *vibrant* Metheno was.”

Billy’s jaw tensed, but he kept staring outwards at the southern ocean, away from the dock and the town.

“Ah, anyone can paint their house pink,” Billy heard Benjamin’s booming voice. “These people, they are all about show, but their ships are slow, and I hear they still don’t have trains or know how to make *real* guns.”

“There were guns in Metheno, right?” Damian’s voice was louder and directed at Billy. Billy scowled, and he blinked with force to shut off his mind. He reached for something in his pocket.

“Benjamin, here,” Billy turned, careful to avoid Damian, and held out a beige envelop. He hyper-focused his vision on Benjamin, as to ignore the bustling people in the background.“And thanks again.”

Benjamin smiled and took the envelope from Billy. He opened it, and ruffled through its contents. His look turned into one of concern. 

“Where’s the rest?” He asked. 

“It’s a two-way trip,” Billy replied. “I already put an extra ten percent in there for the finder’s fee. You’ll get the rest when we safely return to Apathasaw.”

Benjamin sighed and shook his head. But then he chuckled, and threw two muscular arms around Billy’s back.

“And you always call me a cheap bastard,” Benjamin smiled and gave Billy a hefty pat.

Billy let out a thrust of air; Benjamin was a friendly giant, but sometimes forgot how much stronger he was than everyone else. After catching his breath, Billy let out a laugh.

“Yes, because you are one. This isn’t cheap, it’s careful.” Billy smiled and pointed a relatively tiny finger at Benjy’s belly. “But *you* paying me for every single bet or challenge you’ve lost--- in booze that I now know is probably close to *free*--- that’s *cheap*.”

“But you like it, no? You would’ve just taken my money and bought it anyway for double the price!” Benjy chuckled, and Billy couldn’t help but give an admitting nod.

“See, this is what you Wreathwardians don’t get. All that matters is that we’re both better off,” Benjy said.

“Yep,” Billy smiled. “I guess even after all these years, I’ll still never be a true Apathasawian.”

“Hah!” Benjamin laughed. “That is ironic, because another thing Wreathwardians get wrong is they think men can’t change.”

The dark-skinned man placed a massive hand on Billy’s shoulder. 

“You do have Apathasaw spirit, Billy! You just--- you look *tight*. Maybe you have to let some things go, and then you can be free like us.”

Billy’s smile faded slightly, though he tried to keep it intact. Benjamin didn’t notice, though, as his eyes drifted to Damian. 

“Hey, the boy is waiting,” Benjy said. “Go on now, Billy, and do whatever *mysterious* thing  you don’t have balls to tell me.”

Billy rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t help but smile as Benjy gave him one last pat on the back. Damian also smiled and said a goodbye to Benjy. 

The two of them walked down the plank onto the dock. Billy gave Benjamin one last nod before stepping out into the crowd of sailors.

What he told Damian was still true--- no one could be trusted--- but at least with Benjy, he could loosen up a little bit.
