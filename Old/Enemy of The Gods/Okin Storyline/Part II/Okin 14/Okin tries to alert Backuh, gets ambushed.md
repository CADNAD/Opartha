He heard footsteps behind him. Had some of the beggars recognized him from the time Gendro had given them charity and followed him in hopes for more? Or was it just a diseased animal hoping for food?

He turned his head to check. He only caught the edge of a black blur slide behind one of the desolated houses.

Okin’s feet froze, and he steadied himself.

“Hello?” The Ather shouted towards the house.

No answer.

Okin tiptoed backwards, keeping his eyes fixed on the spot he swore he saw something flash by.

“Hello?"

His head jerked to the sound of another rustle, this one closer, coming from the houses on his side of the street.

“Ateon, is that you?” Okin whispered towards it. “It’s me, Okin.”

Okin hunched down, glancing around the block. 

Another rustle behind him. He jumped back and in fear. 

His breathing slowed and his chest fell. It was just wind blowing leaves behind him.

He barely had time to register the sound of footsteps behind him.

Okin swung around. His arm hit something hard.

He heard a grunt, and could only manage to scream as he tried to run. 

The attacker caught his arm. Okin *dashed* forward. His shoulder *yanked* back, and he shouted in pain. He spun around to try to get free. 

He came face-to-face with his assaulter, though it was just a tall, dark blur to him.

Okin whipped his arm around, and the attacker gave, but the force was too much. Okin’s back *slammed* against the pavement, and his teeth rattled within his skull. 

The dark figure lurched on top of him. Okin kicked, but his torso was caught between the man’s legs. The man held a long knife in his hands. He raised it above Okin’s chest.

*Plt!* Blood splattered all over Okin’s eyes. He screamed and closed them in fear. His heart emptied.

But--- he felt no pain. Metal clanged against the pavement and rung in his ears. His senses left him.

Okin felt his heart pounding. He opened an eye, and through a clouded veneer of blood saw a sight that made him scream in terror. 

A *knife* was inserted right through the attacker’s neck, just underneath the strange grey-beaked mask he wore. The attacker’s arm was still raised as if he was to strike, but his knife had fallen to the pavement. Blood continued squirting all over Okin’s once-white robes through the opening.

Kicking and screaming, Okin pushed the assassin off him. The man’s limp, dead body slumped onto the ground. 

Tears in Okin’s eyes streamed and mixed with the blood. He wiped them aside and flung his neck around. His shaky fists protected his chest, and with erratic jerks he checked the surroundings. 

“It’s okay,” Okin swung around and raised his fists. “It’s okay, it’s just me, Okin,” the ever-so calming voice said again.

Okin spun around with his fists guarding his face. His neck and herd twitched and his belly jumped up and down for breath. His eyes squeezed with tears, and he didn’t look at the speaker though he knew that Ateon was right in front of him.

“Now you see,” Ateon’s voice returned to a normal pitch. “Now you see that these men will stop at nothing to hide the Truth.”

Okin dropped his guard. He nodded like a child accepting a brutal punishment; tears kept welling in his eyes. He squeezed his eyelids shut in attempt to stop them, but they kept flowing. He let them fall into his hands.

Ateon placed an arm around Okin as the Ather cried into his hands. Even the beggar’s touch comforted him at the moment, and though the man probably smelt terrible, Okin’s nose didn’t notice. Ateon’s arm around his back just brought a much-needed sense of comfort.

“*Why*?” Okin shouted. “What *is* this, Ateon? They--- what could be at stake that someone would try to k-kill me?”

Ateon sighed. “I---”

“I know that there is something you are not telling me!” Okin pointed a finger right at Ateon’s chest. Blood and tears streamed down his face.

“Calm down, Okin!” Ateon shook Okin’s shoulders. The man’s voice, deeper than usual, ran through Okin’s ears and shook his whole body. “Now is *not* the time for panic.”

Okin stumbled backward. His chest fell and his breathing calmed. Okin wiped the mucus, blood and tears on his face with his sleeve. It was already so stained that he didn’t even care anymore.

He looked up at Ateon. The usually decrepit, unkempt man looked a little more lively and clean today, though it was his---

*Aredal*. Okin instinctively glanced at the dead assassin, though he couldn’t even get past a quick blur of black and red before having to look away.

“It had to be done, Okin,” Ateon said. “The Gods do not prohibit violence when an innocent man’s life is in danger.”

“What if I’m---,” Okin took a deep breath before looking back at the fallen attacker. 

“What if I’m not innocent?”

A strange tiny mark of relief washed over Okin; the sight wasn’t *quite* as ungodly as he imagined. The attacker had worn a black mask with a dull grey beak and small glass covers where the eyes would be; his likely mortified face was hidden. The blood had mostly been absorbed by the dark cloak and had mostly stopped pooling on the ground around his neck. 

*Was it really--- did* Aldwin *really send this man to kill me? Or did someone else discover what I am investigating and try to silence me?*

“You are *better* than innocent, Okin,” Ateon sighed. “You have made extreme Sacrifice in order to pursue Truth and Justice.”

“Or maybe I have just caused chaos and destruction,” Okin shook his head.

Ateon picked up the attacker’s knife from the floor. He pulled something out of one of the many pockets of his strange brown cloak, and leaned down next to the man’s neck.

He grabbed the handle of the throwing knife, and *yanked* it out of the man’s neck. 

Blood spilled, but only a few drops hit the ground before Ateon clasped his hand on the man’s neck. 

“Come on,” Ateon said, pressing down what Okin guessed to be a bandage of some sort. “We must hide the corpse, and we must do it now.”

Okin’s nose shrivelled. He didn’t want to *touch* the man again--- and this--- this felt of Tregale and Deionis. 

Ateon ran over and grabbed the man’s legs. He looked at Okin and pointed his chin towards the man’s arms.

Yes, this *was* of Tregale and Deionis. But--- they couldn’t just go and *tell* the courts what happened and expect them to believe them--- could they?

He didn’t have time to think about that now. If he didn’t move, someone *else* would find them with the body, and the courts would hear someone *else’s* story.

He leaned down and grabbed the man by the arms. The man’s dead body slumped in between them and his cloak dragged against the ground.

“Come on. It’s not far,” Ateon said. 

The blood all over his robes, that deadly feeling of somehow *guilty* adrenaline--- Okin didn’t feel like an *Ather* now.

Though it pained him, Okin scrutinized the assaulter. He had to widen his eyes to pierce through the darkness. His neck slumped to the side, showing the grey-beaked mask which encapsulated the whole face in blackness with only eyeholes. There were ruffled engravings and embossments that made the face resemble that of a raven.

“Did you see this man anywhere else before?” Ateon whispered. The disheveled vagrant checked his six as he continued to drag the corpse backwards.

“No. I don’t think so,” Okin replied.

“How long do you think he’s been following you?” Ateon asked with haste.

“I--- I have no---,”

“Where were you before this?” Ateon asked.

“Just--- just the printing shop. And before that, the visiting complex. And before that the Cathedral ere Olitheon\[ 2022-01-24, 3:32 PM

Check--- it isa library in ch12 and 13\],” Okin stuttered. Something rubbed under his wrists as he carried the man, and he adjusted his grip. 

Ateon nodded. “Well. You can’t show your face at any of those places again. We don’t know where they have men, and how many they have.”

Okin finally noticed how fast his breath was as he tried to calm himself. He just nodded like a disciplined child.

“Here,” Ateon whispered, and Okin recognized it as the usual mini-alleyway where he usually met the mysterious vagrant.

Ateon set the man’s legs down, and Okin followed suit. He heard a *squish*, but it was so dark that Okin couldn’t tell what it was.

“I thought we were going to--- to--- *get rid* of it somewhere!” Okin shouted.

“I will handle that. But for now, we must leave it here,” Ateon placed something--- Okin assumed it was a blanket--- over the corpse.

“You look--- *exhausted*. If you want, you can stay here.”

Okin blinked, and the adrenaline washed away. His eyelids drooped. His whole body slumped forward, and he had to force his head upright as not to faint.

How long had it been since he last slept? He’d lost track, but now he realized just how tired he actually was.

But--- he wasn’t sure if he wanted to stay *here*. Maybe it was a bit of a lack of Humility--- but also, he didn’t want to stay so close to a *dead body.* And The Citadel got pretty *cold* at night, *and* well--- Okin had been out at *Dark* more than enough in the past few weeks.

“Is there somewhere else you have to stay? I--- I fear for your safety, Okin,” Ateon said. “If these people could find you *here*---“

Okin’s eyes widened. He had *completely* forgotten about *that.* Now, the messiness--- even the *corpse*--- seemed secondary.

“Well--- yes. I--- I do not have anywhere else to stay,” Okin looked down to the ground. “But I--- I---“

Okin widened his eyes and scanned the ground. Thought the alley at first appeared *impossibly* Dark, his eyes had adjusted rapidly. He could just make out strange, brown clumps on he ground--- clumped-up leaves? Or...

Ateon burst into laughter. “Not right *here*. Well, yes, here, but not on the *ground.”*

Okin raised an eyebrow. What was the vagrant talking about?

“Here,” Ateon dragged the now-covered body out of the way. He kicked one of the other blankets on the floor aside--- uncovering a massive, pothole-like cover with a large iron handle in the middle.

With both hands, he grabbed the handle and lifted it up. The lid popped open and revealed some sort of tunnel downwards.

Okin peered over--- there was a rusty ladder descending downwards--- into pure darkness.

“Come on,” Ateon said. “Don’t worry, there bottom is only a few feet down, actually.”

Did Okin trust this man enough to descend into--- well--- *Darkness* with him?\[ 2021-11-28, 4:15 PM

Too on the nose? Lol\] 

Okin stepped down onto the ladder and began his descent. He didn’t dare look down at the blackness below. 

Now, the evening that seemed Dark was as bright as a cloudy afternoon. Though there didn’t appear to be a hint of sun through the rooftops of the houses, Okin could somehow make out the man’s hand sticking out underneath the blankets.

And--- something else. Strange metal rings, but they definitely weren’t *gold* or *silver.* They appeared to be the same dull grey as the beak of the mask the assassin wore.

“Uhm--- Ateon? Are we just going to leave the--- the body here?”

“We won’t be able to get it back up,” Ateon said from below. “Just leave it under there for the time being. This alley is very dark and people don’t walk by here that often, and if they do spot it, they will just assume it’s another beggar.”

*Yeah, getting it back up would be difficult. And if this was essentially his* house--- 

Yeah, Okin wouldn’t want to have a corpse in his house either.

“You *are* going to dispose of it soon though, correct?” Okin asked.

“It will be gone before you know it,” Ateon winked. 

Okin’s jaw dropped. Of all times, *this* wasn’t the time for--- jests.

“And close the lid,” Ateon said from below.

Okin reached up; there was an identical handle on the bottom. He slammed it shut.

Okin felt for each rung one foot at a time, and carefully descended down the ladder. Before long, both of his feet touched the ground. 

It--- it didn’t feel slimy or wet, as he expected. It felt like hard concrete.

*Did he--- did he* build *this--- this bunker?* 

He peered out-- there was nothing but Darkness in his wake. 

“Uhm, is there any---“

Ateon lit a lamp, which brightened the surroundings--- but just enough to *barely* see the vagrant’s beard and cloak. He handed the Ather the small circle of Light.

Okin raised the lamp and walked around--- it seemed there was nothing but plain concrete walls here. 

“There is a blanket on the ground just in front of my feet. It’s thick enough that you’ll only feel the rough ground slightly,” Ateon said from the far side of the room.

Okin shivered, but he lowered the light and stepped forward until he saw the blanket on the ground. 

He paused--- was he really going to sleep here, in nearly pure Darkness, with a man that--- in full honesty--- he didn’t really know?

Then again, what choice did he really have?

Okin laid down feet first, making sure that his hole body rested on the blanket. It had dried, but he still felt a hint of the dried ichor rub against his skin.

He shivered in the Darkness, and rolled onto his side. The lamp which he had placed down glowed just in front of him, and he stared into the fire.

“Ateon,” he whispered, though his voice echoed off the concrete walls and filled the room. “I know there is something that you are hiding from me.

“Your instinct is strong, Okin. But the information is dangerous for you or anyone to know,” Ateon spoke from behind him. The man’s voice was deeper than usual, and the raised, impish tone he usually carried was missing.

Okin whipped around. 

“*Dangerous*? I was just about to *die!* Clearly, someone believes that I already *have* this dangerous information!” He shouted into he darkness.

“You have but a piece of the puzzle. The more you have, the more dangerous it becomes,” Ateon’s voice echoed throughout the room.

“I have committed myself to this!” Okin shouted. “I have made Sacrifice and sinned against my God! And yet you do not tell me the full Truth of what I am fighting for!”

There was no response, and in the intense Darkness, Okin felt as if he were talking to himself. 

His rage mounted, and he stood up.

At that moment, a figure came out of the shadows. 

In shock, Okin stumbled backwards. His feet slipped on the blanket, and he fell back first onto the ground.

The dark figure leaned down, encroaching upon Okin’s fallen body.

Okin peered upwards, his arms shook. For the second time today, he felt like a helpless mouse being pounced on by a cat from above.

Ateon’s cloak shadowed over him, and through it a spindly arm extended.

Okin’s face trembled, and he scampered backwards on his palms. Ateon’s arm just stayed in place, just above Okin’s chest, hand extended.

Okin stared directly at it, and then up at Ateon, though he couldn’t make out the man’s features. His shaking stopped--- and in an instant, he felt like an idiot.

The man was offering him help to get up.

*Or?*

Okin looked back to Ateon’s hand. The man tilted his palm to the side so the tiny bit of flickering light hit it.

Okin’s eyes widened.

An ashen star in the centre, and two golden triangles ending at the bottom corners of the palm.

The mark of Justice. The mark of Bravery. The mark of Aredal.

The mark of an Ather.
