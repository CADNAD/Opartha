*Boom-Twawoh! Boom-Twawoh! Boom-Twawoh! Boom-Twawoh! Boom-Twawoh!* All five bottles shattered into a million pieces. *Whoop!* South and above them, the sail whipped backward. It stopped in its new place. The wind battered against it, pushing through five tiny, newfound holes.

The shards of the bottles fell across the deck; it was impossible to tell which came from which bottle anymore. Only the cracked bottoms still lay on the circular wooden table.

Still holding the steaming holster, a clean-shaven man wearing a matte leather jacket tipped his cowboy hat toward the small group of onlookers. With a spin, he shoved the revolver into his hip holster. His lips turned up into a smirk at their wide-eyed expressions.

“You sure you aren’t using Heraldry?” A hulking, dark-skinned man said. 

The man in the cowboy hat shook his head and the other side of his mouth curved up into an even smile.

“If Billy was using his Heraldry,” a softer voice, like that of a young teenager, spoke up from behind the group. From a circular wooden table across the deck, a youth not much older-looking then he sounded brushed away a dark mop of hair as he looked up from his book. “You could start him off backwards, gun still in the holster, throw those bottles up in the air n’ it still wouldn’t be a contest.”

The cowboy, Billy, proffered a leathered-gloved hand to the dark-skinned man, and his smiled widened. 

“C’mon, y’know I’m just gonna give right back to ya for some booze, anyhow,” he laughed, as did the rest of the crew, besides the dark-skinned man.

The giant black man shook his head with a sigh, and reached a meaty palm into his pocket.

“Matter of fact,” Billy said. “Forget it. Just get me and the kid two beers each.” He jabbed a thumb toward the dark-haired teenager who had dived back into his book.

“No,” the kid spoke up. “I don’t want any.”

“Aw, c’mon,” Billy made his way over to the table where the kid was reading and sat down on one of the drilled-in stools. “It’s been like--- five months we’ve been on this ship? You certainly don’t have the mouth of a sailor, but at least for a day you can pretend like you have the liver of one,” he chuckled.

The kid, still glued to his book, couldn’t help but show a slight smile. “First of all, you probably haven’t been checking that watch much,” he threw his chin toward a golden watch on Billy’s arm. “But it’s only been a few weeks. And we’re almost there, too, so I don’t want the first part of me that touches Wreathward to be a knocked-out skull.”

“Ah, you fucking smart ass,” Billy laughed. “You’re right though, probably ain’t safe for ya to be drinkin’ so much anyway,” Billy reached an arm over the table and patted the boy on the shoulder, before getting up with his arms outstretched towards the vast seas. “And hey, more for me.”

The cowboy tapped his tall boots against the deck to a rapid beat while whistling a tune. Damian smiled and shook his head.

Billy whistled to the skies, spinning around like he was *already* in a drunken stupor. The few other crew members gathered in hearty laughter and started snapping along.

He continued dancing. Gradually the gaggle’s laughter quieted, but their smiles grew as they looked upwards.

With his eyes closed, the cowboy spun around again and hit his heel on the deck in a strange outstretched dance move. His attention was attracted by the sound of clanking glass, and his expression brightened into excitement. Standing atop the hatch to the lower deck was the massive dark-skinned man, three bottles tucked underneath his right arm. Strangely, his arm was outstretched to the sky like he was trying to get Billy’s attention, though he had already captured it.

The man’s finger’s curled, and Billy‘s mouth formed a confused expression. The dark-skinned man smiled cheekily, and Billy looked up to where his hand was pointing---just in time to receive a splash of beer to the face from above.

“Damn it, Benjy!” Billy jumped away, but the dark-skinned man, Benjamin, turned his hand and the bottle followed Billy in the air, dripping beer onto his hat and jacket. 

The group of men and even the dark-haired kid’s eyes had been drawn away from the book, and he was giggling.

“Not the hat! Not the hat!” Billy crouched down and covered his hat with his hands as he still attempted to scamper away from the floating bottle. Finally the last drop settled on his finger tips, and he peeked up with one eye to make sure no more was coming.

Benjamin floated the now-empty bottle back into his hand like it was a magnet. The rest of the crew had trouble dissipating their laughter.

“So you’re still a sore loser,” Billy said to Benjamin with a smile as he shook the liquid out of his wet hat.

“Got to show off my Heraldry too,” Benjamin threw the empty bottle overboard, and took one of the full ones in his hand. He walked over to Billy, who was still drying off.

“I told you, I didn’t use any Heraldry!” Billy shouted. “I know it may be hard to believe, but some of us are actually good with a gun,” he laughed, taking the bottle from Benjamin’s hand. He popped it open, and chugged down a bitter gulp. Benjamin’s massive shadow towered over him, and he held out the remaining two.

“Oh,” Billy said, looking up. “Damian doesn’t want it. You can have one, on me,” he winked.

Benjamin grunted. “Well, it really is *mine,* anyway, but thanks.”
