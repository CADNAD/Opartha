The Rothar wrung his hands out of the satchel and pulled out the shiny, handheld weapon that they had plucked off of Billy back in Metheno. Okin fell back on his right leg, the large steel boots clunking against the ground.

“You---you never told me you took his weapon!” Okin shouted. “What--- what does that thing even do?”

“I’m not really sure,” The Rothar grinned, fumbling around with small iron pieces between his fingers. “Apparently it’s even more potent than our best muskets, though.”

Okin lumbered over to Gendro, who pulled open a strange circular centrepiece in the gun, putting the metal bits into perfectly fitting round holes.

“How does it work?” The Ather asked.

“Well apparently, these little things are kind of like musket balls, I think? Not sure how these little things could do more damage than a big steel ball, though.”

Gendro pointed the weapon at one of the armour that was against the stand, the same way Billy had aimed at the guards back in Metheno, closing one eye shut.

“Wait, no!” Okin shouted, holding out his arms. Gendro turned his head towards the Ather, dropping his aimed arm.

“If it’s anything like a musket,” Okin said. “It’ll be way too loud.”

Gendro snorted, then shrugged. “This little thing won’t be too loud. And if it is, well, these walls are very thick.”

He fired right at a standing steel breastplate.

A sharp bang exploded through the room, and Okin squeezed his eyes and covered his ears. The following deathly squeal was replaced by a persistent ringing that bounced within his skull. He had instinctively crouched down, but the armoured jutted into his thighs, so he just fell to the floor in discomfort.

After the ringing had faded, he opened his eyes. A smiling Gendro was knelt down, offering him a hand up.

Okin slapped the Rothar’s hand away. 

“Why did you fire? I told you not to. That was even louder than I expected!” Okin shouted, pushing himself off the floor.

Gendro shrugged. “I’d wanted to see what it’d do.”

The Rothar took a skip in the direction of the armour which had been blasted the shot, but Okin held out a gauntleted hand.

The Rothar raised an eyebrow, and the Ather narrowed his.

“It’s not just a *whatever*, Gendro. You are a serving Rothar, my serving Rothar. It is expected that you follow my orders when I make them,” Okin said.

Gendro nodded downwards, stepping back from his former trajectory. 

“I understand, Okin,” the Rothar said. 

“How can I trust you if you act like this?” Okin asked. “Whatever that is, it’s too dangerous in your hands. Give it to me.”

“I---I’m sorry, I got a little carried away,” Gendro replied, handing Okin the weapon, black handle first.

Okin snatched it away. The metal of the body was similar in colour and shine to his own armour.

He opened the cylindrical centre compartment, just as Gendro had done, and tried to pluck out the minute ammunition with his fingernails.

“Just tilt it up to dump it out,” Gendro said.

Okin glared at his Rothar, but then did as suggested. The iron pieces fell out into his hand.  

He picked up his satchel off the floor and stuffed both the bullets and the gun into it.

Gendro put his hands behind his back, blinking rapidly as Okin threw his bag over his shoulder.

“I---I’m sorry, Okin. I’m so used to hanging onto my contrariness, rebelling against the thoughts and beliefs that most just accept without question. But, here, I was just a fool, rebelling against a man who I am supposed to serve, a man who I do look up to.” 

Okin sighed, placing an arm on Gendro’s shoulder. “You saved my life, Gendro. I will never be able to repay you for that. And I know you are a good man, and a good Dedicant to Nexon. But--- what I am doing, what I have gotten myself into, is beyond baffling. You are now the only person I can confide in, and well, I don’t feel so confident if you do things that put further pressure on me.”

Gendro’s eyes looked up to meet Okin’s, the edges of his scleras becoming red filling with tears. 

“What is going on, Okin? Ever since that day---  you haven’t told me anything. Who were those men I killed, the men with the black bird masks? Why did we have to go to Trenton? Why are we hiding here? Why are you going out so much? What is going on?”\[ 2021-03-02, 5:14 PM

May be too dramatic for this scene, as it is asked later\]

Okin shook his head. It was clear that Gendro was having some sort of emotional shutdown, telling him the darkness that Okin had uncovered would do no good.

“It’s alright, Gendro. I didn’t mean to scare you,” Okin said, patting his friend on the back. “I understand we all make mistakes.”

The Rothar wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. 

“Let us get back. I need to go out, and you need to get back to the others,” Okin said. “I will carry this satchel until I think you are ready to have it back.”\[ 2021-03-02, 6:20 PM

Maybe keep this\]

Gendro nodded, and Okin helped him to the door. Closing it, in his rearview, he saw a dark crack in the chest plate which was dressed on the middle stand.

The Ather rushed over. He took the armour off, and then put it back on in reverse position so that the fracture was on the non visible side, facing another set of armour. 

Kneeling down, he picked up the crumpled shell of the former bullet off the floor. Had the small thing really caused that much damage to such thick armour?

Okin tucked the destroyed round into his pouch, pulled on his visor, and left the room.
