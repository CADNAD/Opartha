For a few seconds, there was only the sound of the splashing waves and the rabble of the other pirates.

*What a weirdo*, Billy thought to himself. It was probably best not to ever get on Kiatus’ bad side, if he had one.

“What we going do?” Benjamin whispered, leaning into the table.

“What do you mean?” Billy asked. 

“How we going to get out of here?” Benjamin asked.

“I don’t know, maybe staying is the best option right now. If we run---that guy’s gonna catch us, there’s no doubt, and maybe we can convince them to go back to safer waters, it sounds like they’ve been there before,” Billy replied.

Allia slammed her bowl on the table, and she shot daggers at Billy. “You complained about Krinosas being too dangerous, and now you want to hang out with a bunch of crazy pirates on the Strait?”

Benjamin waved his hand in a quieting motion. “Calm, Allia. Billy’s right---\[ Not sure if this is the right rythm\] t’is strange situation. The Captain, don’t think he wants hurt us. But---he so weird, I don’t know.”

“Kiatus---he ain’t gonna lay a finger on ya, as long as ya don’t get in the way of him and his...fun,” a boisterous, deep voice spoke from the table next to them. The man wiped off stains of ale from his bushy red beard\[ So many redhads lol\], slamming down his mug.

“And what about the rest of you?” Billy asked.

“The rest of us?” The ginger man laughed. “We all do whatever he says. He wants to keep ya as *pets*, we’ll brush ya and feed ya. He wants throw ya overboard, we’ll get out the plank.”

“Why?” Benjy asked. “Why relinquish your freedom?”

The bearded man stared at Benjy and snorted. “We’re still more free than the rest of those bastards that gave up the sea to bend the knee\[ I like this detail a lot\],” he sang, before returning to his regular gruff tone. “That’s what us pirates say. But I guess maybe Kiatus is just a little emperor himself---giving that he could kill us all in the blink of an eye. Of course we’re gonna do what he says.”

It was logical. This man understood the very real fact of life: don’t swim against the tide if you want to survive. Hah, that was probably another rhyme of theirs. Billy remembered these type of rhymes--- except they were usually told to children to create a false, bubbly reality. These sounded the same, but they were much more honest. It boiled his heart, but the world really *was* just full of the puppeteers and the sycophants. Benjy and Damian would never accept the way things were, and while they were still fools, he understood why. He’d wanted to fight back for more than survival, but that was years ago, before he saw what it was all really like.

“Why does he really stay in the Strait, though? There aren’t even any ships to raid,” Damian turned to face the pirate.

“Some say he’s scared, but I know he’s anything but scared. It’s a calculated move, actually. This is the only place the Empire and the privateers won’t dare hunt us, and it’s only a short sail to the northern trade routes, where we’re heading right now. We all know that gold and booze ain’t worth nothing when ya dead.”

“And is it true? Do you really all stay pirates because of the thrill?” Billy asked.

“I guess, maybe. It’s not nearly as profitable as it was before the Empire. Maybe it’s a weird sense of honour, I don’t know, depends who you ask. I just know I’m not gonna bend the knee and become the bitch of some empire. Especially those stiffs,” the red-bearded man took another swig of ale.

Billy nodded, bile brewing within him at the mention of the Empire, and those like it. He hated them, he hated all of them in his heart, and the venomous blood burst out sometimes, like back at the courtroom in Metheno, and back on the beast. Maybe it *was* time he did something more than just survive.
