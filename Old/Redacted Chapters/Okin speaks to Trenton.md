The Impalias came out of the Cathedral, led by the Devinar. He wore white robes similar to Okin’s, but instead the accenting was a dark violet, matching his pellegrina and cap. He was short of stature, and had a wrinkled face but a plump body.

The old man’s scowl turned into a kind smile as Okin walked forward.

“High Ather Okin! I did not know you were here in The Citadel!” 

Okin smiled, and greeted the Impalias with a warm hug. Gendro let out a short snort, but was silenced by Okin’s glare behind the Impalias’ back. Okin ushered the Impalias away from the Devinars who guarded the entrance, and the two men began to walk along the main road, away from the Cathedral.

“Impalias Trenton. I have come to warn you that there will be a surprise candidate running against you in the upcoming election. I am sorry that you had to hear it from me, and so late,” Okin said.

Trenton raised what little of a grey eyebrow he had. “Who might it be?”

“Impalias Aldwin is pushing his son Previa to run for the region of central Whenran,” Okin replied. 

Trenton scoffed. “I had met Aldwin’s boy before. He knows about as much of our scripture as an Apathasawian trader. I am happy to see you Okin, but please, we both know that this is not even remotely a threat.”

Okin shook his head. “Aldwin is pushing the boy hard, and the other Athers in the central Whenranish region don’t know the extent of his incompetence. Remember, Ariska and the surrounding region were only recently added to the central region, and Previa has always served in the southern area. Most of the Athers that will be voting have never met Previa. Aldwin will ensure that his image is that of a pious, thoughtful new leader. And part of me suspects he will pull more strings than just that.”

Trenton took some time to think, and then looked back to the High Ather. “Aren’t you a good friend of the boy and his father? Why come to me with this?”

Okin sighed. “Yes, I have known both Impalias Aldwin and Previa since I was a boy, and it pains me to stand against them. But I must. We both know it would be worse for The Citadel and Versalism as a whole if someone like Previa became a leader.”

Trenton nodded, and Okin assumed he believed his explanation. It was the Truth, after all. 

“Aldwin is trying to drive me out of the city, but I have other duties which I must perform here, and information I must seek. We both know only an Impalias can give direct orders to a High Ather, and by default the command goes to the Impalias who presides over the region where the Ather is stationed. The delegation of Ariska is largely undecided, but the majority view is that it is now under your jurisdiction. If you order me to stay in this city, there is little that Aldwin can say.  Please Trenton, I need you to allow me to stay in The Citadel. It is for the future of The Citadel.”

Trenton stood still, staring downwards, his eyes unblinking. The wrinkles on his forehead creased even further in thought.

“Please Trenton, if you let me stay, I *promise* that Previa will not be elected.”

A flash of cringe flooded Okin’s face, unnoticed by the Impalias, who continued to think.

“Alright. I will have it be known that I order you to stay here in The Citadel until further instructed,” the old man said.

Okin smiled, and held an arm around Trenton’s back as he led him back towards the Cathedral. 

“Thank you, Impalias Trenton. I promise you will not regret it.”

The Impalias smiled back. 

“I suppose I will alert Aldwin that you now report directly to me? Trenton asked, a playful smile forming on his lips.

“I guess so. He will not be happy about that,” Okin said, smiling back.

Trenton shook his head. “Aldwin is never happy nowadays.”

Okin frowned. Had the man who had acted as a kind uncle to him all his life really changed that much? Aldwin had always been stern to his son, but Okin always suspected it was entirely due to Previa’s *lack* of wisdom, and knowledge surrounding their faith. But now Aldwin had placed a forcing hand upon Okin in an effort to raise his son to a position which was way over his head. Perhaps Aldwin just wanted to give Previa new motivation to ensconce himself in The Citadel?

Okin turned, ignoring the comment. He thanked Trenton with a smile and a wave as the Impalias went back inside the Cathedral, the guards stepping aside to clear the way for the old man.

“You look happy, I assume it was a success?” Gendro said.

Okin nodded. “We can now safely stay in The Citadel, and there is nothing Aldwin can do about it.”

The Rothar laughed. “I guess we will head back to the visiting complex, then?”

“You may go, Gendro. There is some business I need to attend to first.”
