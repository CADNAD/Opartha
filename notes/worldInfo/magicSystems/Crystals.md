# Crystal Generals
- Crystals come inside of geodes. The outer geode is an extremely durable material which is also the only material which can block Heraldry and also not be controlled or affected by any Heraldic properties. It is deemed simply "Heraldshell" by The Citadel, and many other slang terms by different cultures. It is often used as armor for extremely well trained soldiers who are tasked with eliminating the most powerful Heralds in an army. A crystal can be divided by a skilled welder for differing effects depending on its type. All Crystals are brittle if hit in certain ways. All Crystals cannot be controlled or affected by other Heraldries.

Crystals come in five different types. Their sizes inside the geodes, shapes, and durability remain the same, but their colors differ as do their Heraldic properties.

## Crystals in the Economy
Crystals are very rare. Thus they are usually extremely valuable, but as they are only utilisable by Heralds, possibly worthless in some less developed areas.

## Crystal Attunment
A Crystal is attuned to a Herald upon use, but if a Crystal is already attuned, it must be detuned by its previous user to be able to be used by another user, besides some exceptions. Crystals detune automatically upon death.

# Light
A Light Crystal appears as a clear color when it is empty, but it grows to a bright white as it stores extra Light. If Light has been stored up passively, it glows in the dark, emitting a constant amount of light for Light Heralds to absorb, but that dims. Light Heralds can also store particular types of energy inside for later use. 

# Space
A Space Crystal appears as a pale indigo color, but it flashes to a glowing amethyst when in use by a Herald.
## Teleportation
### Blink
A Teleportation Herald can attatch its Crystal to another object, including a living one, and blink that object to another location, moving it and the Crystal together.
The viable size of the object and its location accuracy depends on the Herald's skill, and many cannot teleport another person. On the other end, many skilled Heralds throw a crystal at an opponent and then blink them into a nearby dangerous area, though this manuever is very difficult to execute.
### Portal
A Teleportation Herald can use a Crystal as a waypoint to create Portals to quickly and reliably, without having direct line of sight to the area, after attuning to the Crystal. 
## Transportation
A Transportation Herald can use a Crystal as a very powerful pushing object, to exert a force of its own instead of physical force. An attuned Space Crystal is also the easiest object for a Transportation Herald to move, and thus many simple weapons are often made out of or partially with Space Crystals. A Transportation Herald can detect, move and redirect a Space Crystal about three times as fast as an Object of the same dimensions.

# Time
A Time Crystal appears as a forest green color, but it becomes a brighter yellowish-green as it gets fuller. A Time Herald can choose to store its Time inside a Time Crystal instead of using it, essentially creating "Time in a bottle." 

# Elemental
An Elemental Crystal appears as a dark maroon color, but it flashes to a glowing scarlet when in use by a Herald.

- Can funnel form of matter through and change it, which degrades the crystal, the more similar the form of matter (by proton count), the less the crystal degrades. It is possible to fail a transmutation if the forms are too dissimilar. Also, a Herald needs to know of the form beforehand.

# Dark
A Dark Crystal appears as a black opal, but its inside swirls with the same Dark smoke as the contents of a Creation Herald when in use by a Herald. Dark Crystals do not necessarily require detuning to be used by another user.
## Creation
Creation Heralds get "extra memory" from a Dark Crystal, which they can store either Modules or Creations in. Dark Crystals can also be used to transfer Modules and Creations between two Dark Heralds.
## Consciousness
Consciousness Heralds can use Dark Crystals to store memories and thoughts, which can later be read by another Consciousness Herald, though each Crystal has a maximum amount of data they can store within a Crystal. Consciousness Heralds can also use two Crystals cut from the same geode as a communication device, transmitting thoughts between themselves and another Consciousness Herald holding the other Crystal. The complexity and understandability of sending these messages depends on the Heralds' strength and skill, so even though it is a potent communication device, it is an inferior substitute to meeting in person.
## Illusion
Illusion Heralds can project illusions from where Crystals are if the area is dark, even if they are not present in the area. 
## Duals and Tris
Illusion and Consciousness Heralds can project what they are currently seeing to a Crystal they are attuned to. However, dual of either illusion or consciousness with Creation must decide the function of the Crystal upon attunement: if used for another purpose, the data will be erased.
