It wasn’t long until Benjamin was snoring, and the piercing light that spilled in under the door had faded. Billy leaned up slowly, wincing at the squeak of the wood under him. 

He tiptoed out of bed, but soon gave up on the act after Benjamin’s heavy droning continued.

Billy craned his neck to the roof, forcing out a throaty exhale. “Benjamin---I hate to do this to you. And it’s not because of you, or even because of her,” he sighed again, standing up and finally facing his friend. “I just can’t take my little brother to the most dangerous place in the world.”

Billy spun on his heel, bursting out of the door. 

Only the stars and moon warded off the encompassing darkness now. Damian was wrapped up in blankets on the floor, a mass of tendrils reaching down from the blob above them. His eyes were closed, and he slumped back against the side of the ship.

“Damian!” Billy knelt down, whispering, shaking his brother awake. “We can’t go to Krinosas. Please, you have to turn this ship around.”

“What---,”  Damian peeked open an eye. “Billy, I thought you talked to Benjamin. I thought---“

Billy placed his hands gently on Damian’s shoulders, which were wrapped up in those strange, translucent tentacles. He pulled his brother closer to the centre of the ship.

“It’s not safe, Damian. I’m not sure if you *remember* the few things that---that father told us about Krinosas, but maybe you remember all the legends the sailors on *his* ship told,” Billy pointed at the cabin where Benjamin lay asleep. “The monsters, the savages!” 

“Those---those are just myths, Billy,” Damian huffed, his eyelids fluttering closed again.

“Even if they are, it is a freezing jungle, full of who knows what!” Billy shouted, shaking his brother again. “Please, we have to go back.”

“I’m not going to, Billy,” Damian muttered.

Billy groaned and grasped at the his brother’s arm. 

“Fine. If you won’t, I will.”

He yanked Damian’s blanket off, then proceeded to tug on the tentacles looping around his arms. 

“Billy, stop!” Damian shouted, pulling away.

A ghastly shrill blew through the air, and Billy could’ve sworn his eardrums were blown out. Grimacing, he kept pulling, Damian shuttering both ears with his hands. He was so close to getting them off---

The monster shrieked again, even louder than before. Billy fell on his knees and shut his ears. The world around him shook, and he rolled over on the deck, the slimy blob loitering over him.\[ More action here

He took a relieved breath and unclasped his ears. Damian was still sprawled over the deck, groaning. There were hurried footsteps coming from the cabin below, where Allia slept, and knocking on the door from his own cabin. He reached for the tentacles---\[ More action here
\]
There was a thundering boom, followed by the return of an even harsher, deafening schreech. Slimy, wet goo exploded through the air, sticking to his face and covering his eyes.

Then, the ship fell from the sky. 

Billy screamed, though he couldn’t hear it. He tucked his hands into his sides, feeling as though the ground beneath him would lose him. He tried to look for Damian, but there was nothing but a blur.

The ship crashed down, paining Billy’s side from the brute force. Water blasted high in the air from all sides of the ship, and waves crashed onto the deck---as did the giant Ytternu, its corpse leaking gooey guts across the ship.

A latch from underneath the deck clicked open, displacing the creature’s innards, and a frazzled Allia stepped out of the trapdoor from below.

“What--- what happened?!” She coughed. “The bottom of the boat, it’s leaking! We’re lucky we landed on water, but we’re going to sink---“

The door to the cabin slammed open, and Benjamin stood in the doorway. His chest rose in heavy breaths, his nose fuming. Billy’d never seen his friend look so aggressive---with that massive frame, it was downright scary. With every stomp, the ship seemed to sink further, and there was rumbling and creaking from below.

“Billy! What did you---“

A violent gust zoomed by, and Billy’s vision blurred. It was bizarre; a streak of dark browns and navies, which could only be assumed to be the sky and the ship at this time, but cutting through the blur, at the end of the rush, were streaks of bright fire. He couldn’t even tell if he slowed Time instinctively, but he probably did, as the whirlwind seemed to last seconds.  

The obscurity ended, and his brain ricocheted with in his head. His vision criss-crossed figures and lights blurring over themselves. After a few-seconds, the scene became clear. 

Standing above him, Damian, Benjamin, and Allia was a smiling man, dressed in a dark leather coat with a multitude of buttoned vests, which colours and embroideries were unclear in the flickering torchlight. Youthful, handsome, yet disordered, his pearly teeth shone against the grimy ruggedness of his fellows like a lighthouse on a rocky cove. His smile was not sick or twisted like those of the lawmen of Billy’s past, no, his lips and cheeks curled up to form a whole unit with eyes that sparkled like emeralds set ablaze. 

He stood in the middle of them, the only one not carrying some sort of large-barreled gun or torch. A flag of equal darkness whipped in the wind above them, high up on a tower of flapping sails. \[ Unclear what is happening here\]

“I apologize for the disturbance,” the smiling man said. “You were causing one of your own, though, and we had to shoot down the poor beast\[ What beast\]. When I looked up in the sky and saw *that---*well, it was quite magnificent. I want to sail one of those one day,” the man flipped away his long, wavy hair by swinging his neck, before squatting down closer to the four captured, who were all knelt down on the ship’s deck. “It is a shame we had to shoot down such a nice ship, but I did manage to save everything from sinking. Wasn’t much though, you were traveling *awfully* light. Perhaps with our extra storage, we can assist in giving you lot a nicer fare.”

“Are---,” Billy met the man’s eyes. “Are we your prisoners?”

“Well---,” the man pursed his lips. “For now, I hate to use *that* word, but yes. But hey!” He stepped back and raised out open arms toward the other men. “A lot of ‘prisoners’ become part of *us*, eventually.”

“And who are *you*?” Billy asked.

“Well, isn’t it obvious?” The green-eyed man laughed, a chuckle echoing among his fellows. “We’re pirates!”\[ Chapter break here\]
