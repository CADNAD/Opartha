Damian sighed, and his hand twitched. Whether he liked it or not, whether he believed it was in him or not, he needed to do this. Billy would---Billy *had*---done the same for him. 

He stepped out onto the balcony, the rush of cool air giving him a boost of life. The beast’s gargantuan, beautiful wing flapped in the distance, showing off its almost embroidery-like patterns of veins. 

He would miss this. A little spark inside him flared, wanting to set Billy aflame for ruining the few good weeks of excitement, of learning, he’d had in years. He quenched it. Without Billy, he would’ve never gotten to see this place, even if it was Billy who had protested so much about coming here. 

He had to do something about it. He enjoyed these people, he liked being here--- but he couldn’t let them harm his brother. The only person who had always cared for him, and whether he liked it or not, the person that was his rock, his guardian.

Wheels of a plan started to turn in his head, along with estimations of how high in the air they were. Those numbers terrified him, along with every time he remembered he was standing not inside a rock face, but within the spike of a massive beast.

Damian turned from the red wings, the blue sky, the golden sun. He blew out the light from his room before stepping out into the cavern of the mountain.
