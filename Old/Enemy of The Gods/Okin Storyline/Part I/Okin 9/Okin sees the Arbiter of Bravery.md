“Hey asshole, get---“ 

The carriage driver, a man with a thin gray mustache had his head stuck out the window, but he paused as he saw Okin’s robes.

“I--- I sincerly apologize, High Ather. I was careless and likely driving much too fast. You see, I have---“

Okin gave a curt nod, and the driver returned a more guilty one before leaning back down into his seat.

There was a brutal scraping, and Okin winced. Closing his ears, he spun around. It was those two iron gates that separated The Citadel from the rest of the world, being pulled open by several Rothars at a time.

Those closer to the gates began to gather around the entrance. Okin wandered closer with a curious expression.

“It’s him, it’s him!” A young boy shouted at his mother, pointing towards the massive, opening doors. A packed caravan of robed men, many riding animals, was entering.

The lady leaned down to her child, taking his hand. “It is?” 

The boy continued to point at the approaching mass, his finger raising to a large animal which towered over the rest of the oncoming group.

In the centre of all the robed men was the largest Bortog Okin had ever seen. The black, furry creature was so tall and wide that most men would need a ladder to get atop it, and its legs were almost as thick as the pillars which held up the Cathedrals. It’s nose, surrounded by an oval of paler, yellow fur, could probably fill an entire bucket with just the snot and saliva covering it. It was beyond an abnormal, it was a complete outlier. Had a hunter or a herdsmen seen the backside of this brute in the wilderness of Wreathward, they wouldn’t have recognized the domesticated creature, but instead thought it to be a new, rare monstrosity.

But nonetheless, there was a rider atop the creature. In fact, the boy’s finger shot directly into the slashed, bare, bony chest of the relatively tiny man atop the beast.

*It can’t be.* 

“Yes, it is the Arbiter of Bravery! Uncle claimed he saw him, and said he always showed the scars he got from the battle!” The boy shouted.

The scraping sound stopped as the, gatekeepers did a u-turn and resumed again as the iron doors slowly moved back inwards.

The Bortog came to a halt, and the other men around the bare-chested rider slowed down in unison. A large crowd was already gathering around the strange visitor.

“People of The Citadel,” the bare-chested man shouted down. “I have returned from the heart of Marthia, after speaking to the Synodontis, heir of the Gods.”

*Seeing two Arbiters in two days? Is this a message from Aredal of some sort? And furthermore... one returning from the Synodontis, of all people?*

There was a queasiness in Okin’s stomach; not only because of Billy’s allegations, but Okin always felt that way when someone spoke of the Synodontis as... another God. Something just... felt a little off about that statement. Not only that, but it stirred within him feelings that he hadn’t done his part in--- well, assisting in making this grandiose decision, really. But, who was he to decide? Who was anyone? In his eyes, only the Mouth of the Gods himself could make such a claim.

The giant Bortog plopped its furry chest onto the ground below, blowing a wave of dust through the air and allowing the rider to slide off the beast. The growing horde moved in closer, and Okin stepped in with them.

The rider had a scruffy brown beard and messy hair, and his chest bore several long scars that were either bulged outwards or were deeply etched in his chest. He took bounding leaps through the crowd, creating an invisible divide. The people scurried away from him as if they were unworthy. He stood on the tips of his toes, and reached his hands up to the sky.

“It is true, not only is the Synodontis the son of Aredal, but he is his rightful heir, and he will bring a united Opartha with our help. He will finally truly fulfill the will of the *Gods*.”

A thin, older gentleman spoke up from the front of the crowd. “But, the Synodontis... he rules an Empire in Marthia, not Wreathward! All of our kingdoms, even Farsun, are sovereign, only swearing fealty to The Citadel. Are we expected to just *surrender* and join this Empire of his?”

If he was truly the heir of the Gods, as many were starting to say, he would unquestionably be the guiding Light for everyone. The unsolvable question that no one had dared to answer was simply--- was he?

He understood why many older people like this man thought the answer was a firm no. He also felt that *offness* himself, when even respected individuals like the Arbiter of Bravery equated Synodontis with his... alleged father?\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-20 3:47 PM

The Arbiter whipped around, shuffling over until he was face-to-face with the man. The golden triangle pointing down and to the right shone in the sunlight on his forehead. 

“Ah, great question, my friend. I do not mean we will all unite under his Empire, per se, though even that would not be such a bad idea. The Tzen Empire... oh, it’s not like the brutal Empires of old, like the hordes of Delmia, or the pirates and devils of GaoLei that we hear so much about, or even the relatively moderate Trentanian Empire whose reach spread to even the lands we stand on today! No no, my friend, Synodontis Ty-Shou defeated the mongrels that cheated, and stole, and used their people. In silencing the old, he established a new way of rule. The kind of rule that the Gods intended.”

Okin nudged through the ogling crowd until he was in the front row, just a few feet from the Arbiter.

But it was not his intention to attract the fiery tongue of the flamboyant Arbiter. However, like a feline noticing a cowering mouse, the Arbiter of Bravery jerked his neck and jumped his attention to the Ather.

“You!” His finger froze Okin’s movement through the crowd. 

Okin gestured to himself, though he knew it was him being pointed out. Those around him even drifted away to allow him to step towards the Arbiter.

“Yes, you!” The Arbiter smiled and motioned for Okin to come forward. Okin obliged.

“Tell me, High Ather. You are rather young for a High Ather, yes, but I can see through your trembling and the way you walk that you are troubled,” the Arbiter said.

Okin glanced down to his hand, and forced himself to stand straight and stop all trembling. Aredal, he could even feel his face warm. The Arbiter saw through him like glass.

“I--- I---,” Okin stuttered.

“Go on,” the Arbiter shouted. “Do not be afraid! Do not feel shame!”

“My---,” Okin felt the eyes of the crowd burn into the back of his head. He stepped closer to the Arbiter in an attempt to whisper into his ear.

“My current issues, they are of a very complex, and private---“

“Do you not know who I am?” The Arbiter of Bravery stepped back from Okin and raised his arms out to him. “I am the Arbiter of *Bravery*, son! I do not speak in the shadows! And you---you show yourself to be a High Ather in service of Aredal, he who demands both Truth and Bravery! Are you not Brave enough to even speak what you mean to the world?”

“I-I---,” Okin’s face swelled like a poker set in the hottest of fireplaces.

“Speak, speak!” The Arbiter shouted, raising his hands to the air, his face only inches from Okin’s, who looked to the ground.

“I-I am at a crossroads. For once in my life I do not know the way forwards. There---there is something new to be discovered, something---extraordinary, but possibly mind-shifting. B-but to discover it---I feel I must Sacrifice everything---everything I have built,” Okin finally looked back upwards, his vision covered by the Arbiter’s face, feeling the bearded man’s breath against his neck. A school of blurred eyes tracked him in his peripherals.

The Arbiter sprung away from Okin, hand shot out to the crowd as he shouted his answer.

“Whenever one is at a *crossroads*, as you called it--- one must always take the path the unbeaten path! Do---do what you have not done before!”

The scarred man pointed a long finger at the Ather’s face. “The path that takes twice the courage to follow will end in twice the treasures.”

Okin shook under the line of the man’s finger. Arbiter Dabria, a man he looked up to and loved, had told him to move slowly, and continue to always keep *his* Truth as the highest priority. But this Arbiter... his advice was screaming to chase the path where the hidden Truths lay, to stay in The Citadel, to learn more about the mysterious hidden texts, and to unravel this elusive mystery that kept poking him.

*It would cement my Bravery, and I would make sure that Billy--- and everyone else involved in this oddities--- are brought to Justice. In fact, if I am to believe this crazy vagrant--- I may even reveal the most crucial Truths for my people.*

But could he really do this? Dabria was right, he had all the time in the world to pursue his Dedication, and he would never stop, he would never give up. Was this uncertain direction---this path not traveled---worth following *now*?

He couldn’t be sure.  He looked down the barrel of the outstretched finger and into the glowing green eyes of the Arbiter.

“What do you say, Ather? Will you follow the road less traveled, the road of Bravery?” 

Okin shivered again. 

“I... I don’t know,” the words finally escaped his lips.

The bearded man shook his head, wagging his fingers as he paced along the faux stage the audience had created, drawing all of their eyes.

“You lack conviction! And without conviction, you *cannot* be Brave. How can you call yourself an Ather of The Citadel, an Dedicant of Aredal if you are unsure of yourself? It is impossible!”

Okin turned away from the ranting Arbiter, his shoulders almost raised enough to cover his ears while his head tucked into his neck. A few bystanders, even children, stared at him as he drilled through the crowd and he shielded his face further with his hands.

“Without Bravery there is no action, and without action, how can you pursue the other tenants of the Gods? How can you enforce Justice if you are too scared to go out and prosecute the villainous? How can you collect Knowledge if you are afraid of the traversing the world? How can you find the Truth if you aren’t Brave enough to see it?”

The booming voice of the Arbiter didn’t fade from Okin’s ears until he had gotten far past the square where the crowd had gathered. He wiped his eyes, and finally looked up from his burrowed position. 

Maybe the Arbiter of Bravery was right. Maybe he needed to be Brave and pursue something different. The anger he felt towards Aldwin... that burning curiosity... it all moved him to want to stay here, and find the Truth behind it all.

But it just cost too much. There was no way he could keep going down this rabbit hole while being fully honest. He would have to sneak behind the backs of those he respected, and hide in the shadows. It just...it just didn’t seem worth it.
