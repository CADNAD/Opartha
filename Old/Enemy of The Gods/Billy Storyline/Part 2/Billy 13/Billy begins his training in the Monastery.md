Billy\[ I would add stuff to this chapter explaining how the idea of saving and spending time works.\] trudged down the hall, hands in his pockets. He passed robed men and women in small groups, chatting amongst each other, and seemed to be the only one walking these tunneled halls alone. He hadn’t been here since seeing Allia being brutalized by her Dakung, or whatever they were called.

Speaking of Dakungs, his had given him directions on how to get to the training room through Jerel,\[ Might be better as a scene as opposed to narration\] the smiling bastard, but *Tregale*, were these tunnels impossible to navigate. Unlike the other mountains, the training mountain hadn’t been completely cleared out in the middle for platforms and staircases; instead, there were tunnels and stairs that led around the outside from the hanger.  Not being able to see all the rooms from everywhere made finding yours much trickier.

He sighed to himself, crossing his arms and continuing his plow forward. Part of him had already regretted agreeing to do this. \[ Second part should be a “but,” and not a self thought\]

*Remember, this is about being happy for Damian. Just try to get the most out of it.*\[ Second part should be a “but,” and not a self thought\]

“You Billy?”

Billy perked up, stopping in his tracks. A thin, middle-aged man pointed at him, standing in front of one of those cloth drapes which served as a door to one of the training rooms.

“Yeah, that’s me,” Billy nodded. 

“Ah, nice to meet you. I am Chowondo Beryl. Jerel told me about you,” the man extended his palm out to Billy, who shook it. Never had he met someone with such a pale, bony hand, yet also such a firm grip.

“I understand you’re brand new,” Breslo said, ducking a greying head through the painted cover and into the training room, motioning for Billy to follow. “How’d you find us?”

“That crazy girl, Allia, well---to be fair, she did break us out of prison. And then kinda coerced us to come here. Didn’t really know what this would be till I got here,” Billy scratched his chin. “To be honest, I still don’t really know what this is.”

Beryl laughed, stepping up to the stage, which was a decent-sized area of hardwood flooring. \[ More Descriptions of stuff, I think.\]“Ah, yes, Allia. Jerel’s been talking about her a lot lately.”

*Yep, she always seems to find a way to make herself the centre of attention.* 

“Well,” Beryl said, clasping his hands together. “I hope this will be the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship. As long as I’ll be around, at least. And, most importantly, I hope to assist you as best I can in developing your abilities as a Control Herald, so that you may serve the Forces to the best of your ability.”

Billy scrunched his lips, hiding a wince. He had forgotten about these people’s strange religion. Would he really have to adopt it to survive here?

Remembering how Allia had acted with her Dakung, Billy bowed, eyeing Beryl throughout the motion. The elder man didn’t seem confused by it, so it was probably customary.

“Yes, Dak-young,” Billy said.

“It’s *Dakung*, no *yuh*,” Beryl said, walking over to one of the naturally rocky walls and grabbing two curved wooden swords that were hanging from a strap attached to the handle. They were just two of the many blades, axes, and throwables neatly plastered around the room. “Have you had any type of training before, Billy?”

“No formal experience, but I do know how to shoot,” Billy replied, glancing around. The only guns were some outdated muskets, like the ones used back in Metheno. Those were even more unwieldy then Allia’s gift, which was back in Billy’s room.

Beryl handed him the curved sword. “Ah yes. I heard that you were from Apathasaw. Don’t worry, we do have more modern weapons, but those will only come in handy after more experience. In fact, Jerel was one of the ones who truly pushed for the Monastery to pick up some Apathasawian guns.”

After more experience? All Billy really cared about was training with *real* guns again. If only to get that familiar feeling of drawing his old revolver, or frankly, any modern Apathasawian gun. Truth be told, if Beryl was talking about true one-on-one training, Control Heraldry would do little when it came to dodging\[ Feel disjointed from previous line\]. True, it did help you see incoming projectiles, but when it came to those high-velocity firearms, it was only a small advantage over an average man’s reflexes. You still had to plan and avoid shots, or else it would  be the equivalent of having more time to observe your demise.

“Although all you young guys are all focused on using Control Heraldry in these firefights, Control Heralds have specialized in close-quarters combat since the dawn of time. S,o we’re gonna work on that first,” Beryl said.

Billy nodded, dropping  into a ready position, the wooden blade in one hand, guarding his chest. “Never really used one of these before, though.”

In truth, the practice blade didn’t feel all too dissimilar to the ones he had played with as a child. Though the design was completely different, he had spent more than his fair share of nights fighting Previa with wooden play swords. 

“Good. Your fighting stance is better than most beginners,” Beryl said, taking one leg back and holding out the tip of his sword towards Billy’s chest. “I find that we can best utilize our gifts when we witness what it is like without them. First, let’s start off sparring without any Heraldry.”

Billy nodded. The elder man got into his own stance---one arm forward, pointing the tip of the sword in an upward angle toward Billy. \[ Should probably ask someone whos done martial arts stuff like this for how to write stances etc.\]

An image scrambled the scene in his mind’s eye. The man in front of him was identical in shape and posture, still holding a wooden sword, and maintained a warm smile, complemented by the lush grass and chirping wildlife. 

Billy jerked his head away, shutting his eyes. He staggered back into position, and once again it was Beryl in front of him.

He started off attacking, swinging his weapon in wide sweeps, which were blocked by Beryl. Advancing forward onto his deflecting opponent, Billy swung the sword in an overhead arc. Beryl evaded to the side, simultaneously lunging down and forward, the tip of his sword hitting Billy’s chest.

“I admire your aggression, and it’s good to keep it up. Many students don’t follow up their strikes. The problem is that with a slow, overhead swing, you leave your entire body open for a counter-attack.”

Billy grunted, giving a nod before resuming his attack. He had to resist the urge to slow time, it had  become an instinct whenever he recognized any sort of threat. The two spared for some time, and Billy’s heart would rise every time it looked like his quick combos would break through Beryl’s guard, but it every time Beryl would find some ‘opening’ or another. It was obvious what Beryl was doing at this point: he would mostly defend and evade and wait for his opponent to make mistakes. 

So Billy opted to do the same. As soon as he stepped back, trying to mirror Beryl’s defensive stance, the thin man smiled. His master prodded his arm forward, attempting to stab at Billy’s chest, and Billy blocked it, pushing his body in the opposite direction, making the sword a better barrier.

Beryl was a man of his word, and quickly followed up his stab with a flurry of fury. Billy blocked a cut at his right-hand shoulder, but Beryl instantly turned and struck again at Billy’s leg. However, Billy saw that Beryl’s entire body was open, and lunged forward to stab. Unfortunately, if it was a real fight, he would’ve already had a sword through the chest. At best, maybe he’d leave his opponent with a scar in the torso.

“He who as already started moving to his destination will get there first,” Beryl said. Billy nodded, sighing. 

“Don’t be down. I’ve already seen lots of improvements just in that short little  sparring session, you adapt very quickly. For a fresh Hwasojin, it is more than I should expect. Plus, you’ve already got some valuable lessons to take home. I do not mean to bore you, though, we will only start off each session with a quick skirmish free of Heraldry, as it allows us to recognized the greatest opportunities to use our gift..

“Now think: what advantages does Control Heraldry give you? It allows you to make the most out of your time. Distance and angles are the difference between scoring a hit on your opponent and being trapped in a situation that can only end in your doom. Using your Heraldry gives you the advantage of perception---you can observe your opponent’s movements far before he realizes yours.”

Beryl got back into a fighting stance. “Now, I will remain without it for now, but be free to use your Heraldry.”

Billy nodded, getting back into en garde. The two circled each other the end of their swords tingling against each other.

Beryl’s sword arm jerked, and Billy slowed Time. The ball of Beryl’s back foot had lifted off the ground, and his knees were ever-so-slowly sliding forward. His elbow slowly unbent, hinging his wrist. He was readying to take a stab at Billy’s chest.

Billy could try to evade and do an identical strike at Beryl’s chest. While his Heraldry might’ve granted him a few extra moments, Beryl *had* started his attack first, and he was more swift than Billy. However, Beryl’s attack would leave his entire torso open, and was heavily weighted to his right side.

Billy forcefully swung his sword at Beryl’s, causing the straight-on point to be directed outwards, missing Billy’s chest and even causing Beryl’s arm and shoulder to wobble away from his own body. Billy then flung his sword at Beryl’s unguarded torso.

Beryl laughed, and Billy couldn’t hide his own smile. “Good job, Billy. Now you see how easy it is to be a sword fighter as a Control Herald.

“But what if you are against another, you may ask. Then it becomes a different art, a control of the most minute movements, a battle of *fractions* of seconds. Come at me again, Billy.”

Billy slowed Time, looking for the weakest spot in Beryl’s position. His front leg seemed relatively unguarded, and was closer in distance than the rest of his body. So he released Time, and then closed in, striking.

Before he even started his swing, he felt a dull poke in his chest. 

With a foxy smirk, Beryl tugged back his sword, returning to ready position. Billy prepared in Time Slow before striking again.

And was met by another hit to the torso, that once again he never saw coming. 

Billy jumped back, stunned, and Beryl flipped his sword up being his back, legs together. 

“And before you ask, I’m not a Speed Herald,” the older man said, smirking. “Just a lot of Control.”

Billy growled, clutching his own wood blade, and thrust at Beryl.

The older man spun around, dodging Billy’s shot and hitting him square in the shoulder. Hit after hit after hit, Billy kept trying to score just one more poke at Beryl. but a few minutes in and he would’ve been dead several times over had the swords been sharp, and all he had to show for it was a pile of sweat.

Still, panting, narrowly blocking hits, he smiled. Sure, he wasn’t winning the fight, but he was winning the training. What was before a blur of confusion became something he could understand and start replicating. It was a dance of death, full of calculated faux steps and swings, each a balance of believability and efficiency. A battle of will and mind engaged between the two men, each carefully preserving their energy and precisely selecting when to slow and release Time.

Beryl was nothing short of magnificent; defensively, he was controlled and steady, yet would strike faster than a rattlesnake’s fangs whenever he saw an opening, always scoring an undefendable, often nearly invisible hit on Billy, though the cowboy felt each the weight of each blow. Every time Billy attacked, Beryl would have his sword in the perfect position as an easy barrier. It seemed whenever Billy had enough energy built up to slow Time, he would be in a tough spot and have to expend his valuable resource just to escape Beryl’s blade, or pivot to a different position to get a proper angle, or there would simply be too much distance between them.

Skin red, chest heaving, Billy crouched down into his own ready position. While Beryl’s thin form wasn’t necessary intimidating, the man had a poise which hadn’t faltered despite the long skirmish. He held out his sword, predicting Billy’s approach.

Instead of lunging in, Billy kept a good distance, using the end of his sword and allowing Beryl to expend more energy with pokes and prods. He would need a surplus of Time to have a chance at getting a hit.

The last three times, he had evaded by pushing back on his strong leg, and had been punished for it every time. His instincts told him to slow Time, but he would need every ounce to get the attack through. He had to gamble.

He jumped back on his weak leg to Beryl’s unguarded back, his sword arm narrowly slipping under Beryls’s thrust. Yes, Beryl had struck where Billy would have been had he pushed back on his strong leg, intending to punish.

Billy slowed Time. He could already see Beryl’s neck turning. His plan had worked; Beryl hadn’t slowed Time to read Billy’s footwork as he thought he had caught on to Billy’s habits. 

Billy thrust his sword in an arcing motion to Beryl’s ribs, and released Time.

He beamed, a flood of joy flowing through his body, bringing him out from the formerly cramped panting. The tip of his sword poked Beryl’s ribs.

And just as it did, he felt a dull whack in his left hip.

Billy looked down. In his excitement, he had forgotten to maintain proper stance, leaving his entire hip completely exposed. It had been easy for Beryl to rapidly redirect his prod into a swift cut across to Billy’s exposed body.

But, he still *had* hit. 

“I think I got you first, Beryl,” Billy dropped his sword, resting his hands on his knees. 

“We would’ve both been dead. You, about twenty five times, and I, roughly once,” Beryl chuckled. “But you fought very well, Billy. You understood what I was taking advantage of, a perceived weakness on your part, and you turned it into a strength. Your footwork, understanding of distance and blocking has already improved.” The elder man gave Billy a hefty pat on the back, which caused the outlaw to cough.

Billy picked his sword off the floor, stood up straight, and spun it around in his hand. 

“Well,” he said, smiling. “I’m ready for more whenever you are.”
