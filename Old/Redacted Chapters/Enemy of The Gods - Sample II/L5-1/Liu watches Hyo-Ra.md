Khan and the Herald jogged across the field towards an identical circular stone fort, as Liu climbed up the ladder to the top of the first fortress. 

Liu looked out to the field alongside the rest of the boys, leaning against one of the short stone wall that guarded the roof of the fort. Directly below him was a large pile of stones, and a pile of wooden planks in front of the fort, and in front of him a half-circle was drawn with chalk on the ground, which perfectly encapsulated Hao’s fort. Facing forward were two stone walls which only left a small gap to enter the circle. Further into the field were several other walls, these ones were less put-together and made with wood, surrounding the four dome-like tents that occupied the field, seemingly randomly placed.

A short while later, Liu squinted as he saw what looked like a bird flying across the field; It was a bird, one of the Herald’s parrots. 

*Has the game started?*

The bird flew around Hao’s base, passing Liu and the other spectators. Liu ran to the back side of the roof, and saw it descend into the backdoor entrance. From inside the fort, he heard the parrot squak, “Begin!”

Liu walked back towards the front side of the roof and retook his spot next to Peng. Less than a minute later, Liu saw a what looked like a large turtle waddling out of Hao’s base. It plopped itself down perfectly in front of the gap in the walls, inside of the chalk line.

Without prompt, Peng leaned into Liu’s ear to inform. “That’s a Domesnapper. The opponent wins if he ever gets more ground troops inside your circle than you have, and Domesnappers are strong defensive units, but aren’t too costly. It’s the most common initial summon.”

Liu nodded. For a few more minutes, it appeared as nothing was happening. Then, four grey humanoids came marching out of Hao’s circle. They were only three feet tall at most, with little to no features.  The leader held a rectangular shield that covered even his entire body, even his face. Behind him, in a horizontal formation, marched three identical men that held sharp sticks. 

“Spear-Men and Shield-Men.  Basic backbone of an army, good at controlling space,” Peng said.

The four mini-soldiers continued their march towards the centre of the field. But as they approached, Liu saw a large bird flying towards them, holding something in each of its talons, which were abnormally large.

Two to the left of Liu, Iri perked up. “Wow, Khan must’ve knew Hao was going to play Domesnapper and then a group of Men. Drophawk just dominates here.”

The group of doll-sized men continued their march, oblivious to the hawk above. The hawk stopped over them, releasing its talons, and Liu saw two stones fall upon the heads of the Shield-Men and one of the Spear-Men, who disappeared into a violet mist upon contact. The hawk then flew back towards Khan’s fort, quickly outpacing the two remaining grey soldiers.

Liu leaned in, trying to see the grey men as they came closer to Khan’s tent. He saw the fade of purple mist as the Drophawk killed the two remaining men with two new stones from its talons.

“Drophawks can’t be attacked by most troops, and are also faster than most. However, they have to return to base to reload their talons with rocks every time.”

Iri seemed, for once, interested, and he addressed the group of boys with a wide smile. “Hao has to either get lucky and buy Leechcrows or Sniper Snake, which are both kind of unconventional buys right now. Or, he has to get parrot before Khan gets Parrot and realizes how in trouble Hao is.”

Leechcrows? Sniper Snake? Liu looked to Peng for information.

Peng smiled. “Leechcrows counter Drophawks as they’re air swarms, and Sniper Snake is one of the only long-ranged units that can attack air. But, since both players don’t have parrots, Khan doesn’t actually know how up he is, and neither does Hao.”

I don’t understand all of the jargon yet, but this game does seem quite interesting, Liu thought. 

Quickly after, a parrot came flying out of Hao’s encampment, and Iri’s eyes lit up. “Okay, Hao sends out a parrot. He may still be in the game.”

The parrot glided towards Khan’s fort, where the Drophawk was re-approaching from. The parrot then made a u-turn as it came within range of the Drophawk, but was faster than its predator and flew back into Hao’s base as the hawk was still crossing the center line. 

The hawk continued to advance towards Hao’s base, once again carrying a stone in each huge talon. The hawk came close enough that Liu could see the glowing purple mist coming off if its wings. The hawk stopped just past the chalk line, and dropped one of its stone down onto the Domesnapper below. Liu heard the tortoises’ shell snap as the rock crushed it, but unlike the grey men before, it didn’t disappear. That is, until the hawk dropped the second rock.

From below and behind, Liu heard a strange rattling sound, as if a man shook a cup full of beads. Both Peng and Iri rushed to the side wall eagerly, and Liu saw what they were looking at--- a serpent slithering around the fort, towards the now retreating hawk.

So Khan would have won right there if he had sent out a ground troop along with the hawk.

“Watch, he’s gonna get it,” Peng said with a smile as the snake curled itself upwards. The hawk was now a good dozen feet from Hao’s chalk line, where the snake lay.

A thin, straight blast of venom came shooting from the snake’s mouth, its colour identical to that of the haze which surrounded all the creatures. The blast hit the hawk in the back, and the hawk faded away into nothing. The snake laid back down on the ground, slithering towards the center of the field.

“Well, now Hao should be fine if he keeps the Sniper Snake on defence, but it depends on what Khan has,” Iri said. 

Flying out of Khan’s fort, the parrot quickly caught up with the serpent. 

“Defend home base!” The parrot squaked at the snake. The snake turned around, slithering back towards the chalk semi-circle.

Iri smiled, “It’s almost like he read my---“

The commander looked shocked as he leaned forward over the roof wall, his eyes drawn towards Khan’s side of the field. 

“By Tsuh. Khan saved up for a Bullhog already.”

Liu and the other boys looked towards Iri’s focus, and saw a large, lumbering boar-like creature.  It had large tusks and was the only summon so far that was possibly larger than its real-world counterpart.

Getting closer to the Hao’s encampment, the boar began to charge. The snake spit out a thin shot of venom, and the boar wailed in agony as it stung his front leg. 

But the boar did not fall, and continued to charge.  The snake’s tail started to rattle as it built up more venom in its mouth, but not before the boar swung its massive head, driving a sharp tusk through the snake’s thin body. The snake faded into nothingness upon impact, and the parrot which hovered above the two also disappeared.

After defeating the snake, the formerly enraged boar stood still and calm, before quickly disappearing into the wind. Liu saw Hao leave the confines of the fort along with the Dark Herald, his shoulders slumped.  

“That was a pretty quick one, but a good game nonetheless,” Iri said as he climbed the ladder down from the roof. “It seemed like Khan countered Hao perfectly, despite the fact that I saw no parrots.”

“How’d Hao know he lost, he can’t see the field,” Liu said.

“Ah, the chalk circle marks a Dark Herald’s summoning range. They the sense number of summons, both their own and foreign, in that range. Khan’s herald can also feel when his troops go idle, meaning he’s won the game. They should also be coming out now.”

Some time later, Khan and the other herald rejoined Liu and the group of boys next to the original fort. From the east, two other men also approached the group, receiving a nod from Iri. They wore identical robes to the two Dark Heralds, except theirs were brown.

The two Dark Heralds each handed Iri a handful of coins, and Iri handed each pile to one of the two brown-robed men. To the second man, he pointed towards the far castle, and the man nodded.

Brown...so they must be the Solid Heralds, going to re-bury the coins.

Iri turned to a smug Khan. “That was a very well played game, Khan. “How’d you find out the perfect units to buy, I didn’t even see any parrots?”

Khan smirked. “I knew Hao would open with Mole-Dome, like he always does. So I went double Mole, allowing me to grow faster then him, knowing there was no risk of an early attack or Ravhound rush. Then I got a pretty early gold, and was able to send out the Drophawk, knowing that Hao would probably send out a standard Shield-Stick attack to take center control, and my hawk could attack them and then put pressure on his Domesnapper. I’m not sure if that’s what he did, but it must’ve been, considering the fact he lost this early,” Khan looked smugly towards Hao, who just folded his arms and turned away. “Then I got another two golds, and just went with my guts that Hao had done as I expected, and bought a Bulldog with the extra money I had saved up. And now here we are.”

“So you took a gamble on your opponent’s play style, and it worked out. I like it,” Iri said.

“It sure did,” Khan gave one last self-satisfied look at a pouting Hao.

“Well, now that they’ve seen a game, why don’t we get two of the newbies to play one. The Dark Heralds are impartial, but they’ll help you out with anything you don’t get,” Iri said. “Why don’t you go, Jin... and the real new recruit.”

Iri smiled as he pointed a finger at Liu. 

“Good luck,” Peng smiled at Liu.
