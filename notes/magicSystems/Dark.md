Branches

All branches have access to and utilise the dark dimension in order to create their powers. But Mind herald's power do not allow them to enter the dark dimension.

They are mostly auxiliary jobs to the upper class. Lots of them are tutors, or do mind wiping as therapy.

## School of Creation (Summons)

- Store both Summons/Creations, which are made up of different Modules in the Dark Dimension, which also resides in their memory.
- Modules are created by Creation Heralds, and are a modular 'piece' which can then applied to any Summons a Creation Herald stores in their memory.
- All Summons are made up of different Modules, and are 'compilied' in the Dark Herald's memory beforehand. The Summon takes up 30% of the amount of storage all their Modules use.
- Modules are created and Summons are compilied by experimenting with Dark Matter in the Dark Dimension. A Creation Herald will enter the Dark Dimension by entering a meditative state in which they cannot interact with reality. 

### Modules
Every conceivable property is a Module. While Modules end up taking defined forms, how they are created is somewhat arcane and the experience can only really be known by a Dark Herald, and many Modules that are functionally the same were created in vastly different ways; there are also more efficient ways, or more modular ways, to create the same Modules.

Examples of Common Modules:
- Floating
- Hard

### Storage
- A hypothetical storage unit called Doltars (abbreviated D) exists, which describes how much memory capacity a Dark Herald has, but the numerical exacts of this unit are not currently known, and Dark Heralds do not know exactly how many Doltars their Modules and Creations take up, though many develop the intuition over time, and it is correlated with how difficult a Module is to create. If a Creation Herald is over capacity, they will not be able to Summon their most recently created Summon.
- The compilied Summon takes up 30% of the amount of storage that all their Modules uses. A small module will take about 10 Doltars, while a large can take up to 100.

# School of the Consciousness (Mind)

Consciousness Heralds can read, "write", and at the upper end, control the conscious thoughts and memories of any living being. There is an art to Consciousness Heraldry, and many Consciousness Heralds are very powerful at reading while some are not, and the same for 'writing' (putting memories or thoughts into others' brains), and controlling. Humans are the hardest beings to control, and humans' wild conscious can be very draining on the mental state of a weak Consciousness Herald, even causing them to collapse or die if they attempt to control one who does not wished to be controlled for too long. Every being varies in how hard it is to control, read, and write, though the actual information a Consciousness Herald gains from an animal are only vague feelings, as opposed to humans.

Memories that are "written" are experienced as if they were the person's own memory. But discrepncies in experience, like height, skin colour, voice, can indicate a false memory.

Consciousness Heralds require a path of darkness to enact their powers, or a crystal transmission. The less light intercepting the path, the better: though the best is always by touch, where a there is just direct shadow from person to person. Touch can even work in plain sunlight. 

# School of Illusion 
Illusion Heralds create "bubbles" in Dark areas. The bubbles can be of any shape, and have an inside and outside which projects a certain image of the Illusion Herald's choice. Illusion Heralds have an easier time displaying things they have seen before, but can craft a good illusion, where their memory will fill in logical gaps without them needing to go over every detail. Illusions are impossible to maintain in high light levels, but strong Heralds can maintain illusions for some time in medium light levels, however, a bright flash of Light will interrupt that area of the illusion.

Illusion Heralds have the easiest time affecting the natural bubble around their own body.

Illusions can be visual, sound, or even taste, touch and smell for very well-trained ones, though Illusions do NOT actually affect physical reality, only perception: for example, an illusory knife cannot actually cut someone, nor an illusory hand actually push someone. However, illusions CAN conceal real objects which can affect physical reality: a skilled Illusion Herald can make it appear that they are not really there, and even deafen sounds outside a bubble of their Creation, and then attack a person.
