add Okin visit to synodontis

Concerns:
-Plot is too boring/not compelling, Okin is not a good character for this plot
-Considering:
  - Add more beats between Okin and the Mouth of the Gods (main antagonist)
    - Backuh and/or Revictus use the mind-wiping powers on Okin after Okin discovers a big secret (if Backuh, that Okin is a Dark Herald)
      -

* ACT III
** Midpoint



** Second Pinch Point
*** !  Okin's allies are found and murdered. Okin's life is barely saved by his own accidental activation of Illusion Heraldry.
- [ ] The meeting is attacked.
*** - Okin
- [ ] Okin is in denial about himself being an Illusion Herald.
- [ ] Okin is insecure and still in denial about whether he should tell the truth about being an Illusion Herald and gets guidance from Gendro at a Dark Herald execution without getting into details. Gendro stands by his Versalist values.
  - This time, Okin looks away.
- [ ] Having given up, Okin attends the council, and agrees to vote for Synodontis, which moves the vote to the "next stage".
- [ ] Okin finally can't take it and tests his Illusion Heraldry.
- [ ] Okin is about to kill himself, but Backuh presents Okin with someone who has testimonies of Synodontis' non-godliness (who knows him from Marthia.) Okin is convinced by Backuh's "greater truth" narrative.
- [ ] Okin confronts the most cowardly Impalias directly about why all the other Impaliases are so gung-ho about Synodontis, and also about who attacked the meet. The cowardly Impalias reveals that this was all planned out ahead of time.
- [ ] Okin agrees to go with Backuh on a secret portal trip to meet Synodontis in person again.
- [ ] Aldwin has awoken, but Okin thinks he is the only one who is aware.
** Second Act Turn

** Post 2A
- [ ] Okin kidnaps Aldwin with Backuh's help.

- [ ] Previa tries to visit his father, but finds he is missing. He goes to the Council with the medical professionals to report Aldwin's missing status as the top priority.
- [ ]
** Break Into 3

** Final Confrontation
- Revictus knows Aldwin's been murdered and in desperation meets Okin. Okin meets Revictus, then you hear information in Billy's plot from Architor, then cut back to Okin from high-tension information.
- Deionis frames
- Okin lies in court about Previa's testimony that Okin is a Dark Herald, and that it was Okin that killed Aldwin. Previa is sentenced to death. (B plot close).
** Denouement
- Previa is broken out of prison by Deionis
- Okin acts as a McCarthy-esque demagogue, making false promises to the people to gain power, saying that he has been ordained by Aredal/Olitheon to fight against the modern Citadel.
