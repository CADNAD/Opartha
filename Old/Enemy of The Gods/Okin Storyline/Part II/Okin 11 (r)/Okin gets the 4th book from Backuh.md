The night sky consumed the last few strands of Light.

Okin couldn’t even see the edges of Gendro’s body now, though they both held lamps. He was mostly relying on feel now, more than sight. 

“Are you sure this is the right way?” Gendro asked. “I didn’t even know there were streets this dark and empty in all of The Citadel.”

Neither did Okin, until a couple days ago. Neither did the rest of The Citadel, it seemed.

“It’s here,” Okin replied.

The pure barrenness of this one alleyway didn’t help Okin’s nerves. *This* was what some even theorized the Realm of Darkness to be like--- a silent, motionless void.

The flickering fire inside the metal cage was ever so comforting, and with every additional drop of sweat from his palm, Okin gripped the cage tighter. 

His neck swivelled around from Gendro behind him, to the path in front of him, to the houses so close on his left. 

He stopped, and so did Gendro. He held his lamp up to the side of the house. 

That chipped wood on the outer edge of the house--- it looked familiar. Yes, this was it.

He tiptoed past the edge of the house, and held his lamp out towards the gap. Yes, he could see the light reach farther past the corner of the house. There was a decent gap between this and the next one.

“Hello? Ateon? It’s High Ather Okin,” Okin whispered into the night. He held his lamp forward to the gap, but there was no form or shadow, and not even a blanket.

He waved his lamp around. There was nothing. 

Okin sighed. Had he come out all this way, shrouded in the Darkness, just to embarrass himself in front of his Rothar?

“Who...,” Okin heard a whisper. He snapped around. “...is... the... other?” Okin held out his lamp in all directions, even checking to make sure this wasn’t one of Gendro’s weird pranks. The Rothar, surprisingly, didn’t flinch. He just looked a little confused at Okin’s sudden movements.

“My Rothar, Gendro. He is most trustworthy and Loyal,” Okin said.

“Who are you talking to?” Gendro asked, but he was soon cut off by the whisper. 

“And you have... told him... of this... conspiracy?” 

The voice sounded so close, Ateon must’ve been close enough where Gendro couldn’t even hear. Okin turned around, expecting his lamp to even touch Ateon’s face. But there was nothing.

“Yes!” Okin hissed. “He has agreed to help us, but he wants to meet you.”

“Well then, hello,” a voice of normal volume and tone spoke behind them. Both Gendro and Okin spun around, fists at the ready. 

Wrapped up in his cloak, shorter than both men, Ateon waved a mangled but friendly hand.

“This?” Gendro motioned the bearded vagrant. “This is who introduced you to the conspiracy?”

“Well yes,” Ateon’s voice had that usual hint of mischief. In fact, Ateon’s tone often reminded Okin of Gendro, without the occasional borderline improper remarks. “You may call me Ateon, as Okin has opted to.”

“You met him at the records centre? Really?” Gendro asked.

“Yes, I did,” Okin said. “While investigating the Synodontis.”

“And he just...*told* you about this conspiracy?” Gendro raised an eyebrow.

“Well, he actually phrased it a little like one of your jests,” Okin said. 

“Enough about how we met,” Ateon said with a smile. “That has already happened. We must focus on the ever-important, life-changing future.”

“Well, Okin told me about Aldwin’s deception, and I believe him. But what are we going to do now? Okin has already confronted Aldwin, and though Aldwin has admitted his crimes to Okin, he’d never speak a word of them to anyone else,” Gendro said. “If he is our only lead, and he will not budge, how will we extract more information?”

Ateon laughed. “There are more options than just walking up to Aldwin and asking him. I also know for certain that Aldwin is not the *only* man who is fuelling this cabal.”

Okin had a million questions running through his mind, but he didn’t even have time to actually formulate any of them. As soon as something left Ateon’s lips, something else left Gendro’s and back and forth.

“Who else, then? If you truly know for certain,” Gendro said with a mix of interrogation and slyness.

Ateon just chuckled again, like a father receiving a curious but juvenile question from his son. “I do not know them by name, but I am sure of their existence. A scheme such as this one could not be supported by one man alone.”

Gendro opened his mouth to rebut again, but he was instantly cut off by Ateon.

“But enough speculating about their logistics, we must instead disrupt them. I propose you follow Aldwin, perhaps into his residence or wherever he meets with his fellow conspirators, so that we may find out more about them.”

“If not just an outright crime, that would surely be Deception,” Gendro said.

Okin looked out of the corner of his eye into the infinite darkness, pondering what he could do next. Ateon was right about the last plan; it did little but make Okin angry.

“It is not so much Deception,” Okin held out a lecturing finger to Gendro. “I have told Aldwin I will pursue him, and if he continues to keep this hidden, it is my *duty* as an Ather of Justice to be Brave and stand against him, whatever it takes. I have not falsely pretended to be on Aldwin’s side on this matter, so it is not Deception, and although he is my superior, my duty comes first and foremost to the people of The Citadel and Versalism, so it is not Treachery.”

Gendro let out an audacious laugh. 

“You are to break into his home without his knowledge? I do not see how that could be construed to be anything *but* Deception.”

Okin sighed. Yes, yes, he was getting ahead of himself, and perhaps letting his anger cloud his judgment.

“Yes, you are right,” Okin said. “I will not use espionage to win. But perhaps we can get Aldwin’s closest allies to pull the Truth from him--- starting with his son.”

The vagrant also gave an enthusiastic nod. “Good, good,” he said. “But we should keep our options open. It will take more than one tactic to win this war.”

Okin nodded. He stared into the dim lamplight and began conjuring up possible scenarios. Perhaps he would find another Ather linked to this conspiracy, and they wouldn’t be as strong-willed as Aldwin. Perhaps he could turn the mass of the crowd against his former mentor, and get them to fight for their own right of Knowledge.

Gendro narrowed his eyes at the vagrant. “There is no *war*. Even if---”

“Figure of speech,” Ateon chuckled as he raised his hand to calm Gendro.

Okin towered over the hunched vagrant. “I’ve had enough running around preaching about something which I have not even laid eyes upon. There are other texts, I know, but this started with the Fourth Book of Nexon.”

He held out an upturned palm.

“So let me see it.”

Ateon laughed. “Alright, alright, Okin,” he started to pull out something from behind his back. “But this is for your eyes only.”

Okin nodded and shoved his hand forward. The vagrant obliged and lowered a dry leather-case book into his palms.

The cover was covered in dust which tracked onto Okin’s hands. He tried to beat it off onto the ground, but it was no use. 

“How long have you had this on you?” He asked with a hint of disgust.

“It is one of my favourites. I carry it everywhere,” Ateon replied. 

Okin nodded. He opened the book, and dust jumped out at his face. He closed it with a heavy cough, and turned it to the ground to shake the particles out of its pages.

He turned the book back over and held his lantern close. Gendro scooted closer over his shoulder, more silent and attentive then Okin had ever seen him before.

The paper was crumpled and had a strange orange hue. It was also thicker than any Okin had ever felt, and felt like unpleasant sand against his fingers.

And the text--- it was *Terridian,* not Trentanian. 

Thankfully, Okin’s Terridian was probably better than most of his peers. Though of course some holy Terridian phrases were used during congregations and worship, even few clergymen were fluent in the holy ancient language. And the passages here appeared to be an even older, more foreign dialect.

Okin doubted Gendro’s ability to read, and the words didn’t really mean anything to him in their original form, so he attempted to translate. 

“The... planet?” Okin squinted. The ink was a little rubbed off. “The planet...no interest?” 

Okin shook his head and scowled. It made little sense, but there was nothing he could do except maybe study ancient Terridian more another time.

“Planet rose... sun to sun period, same. All time,” Okin continued. “I... stayed... only tiny one... contrast... no, *compared,* to planet... I did too much. Planet... thinks what?”

Okin looked to Ateon for confirmation. The vagrant just smiled.

“I think he’s trying to ask what the world is thinking? And why they’re losing interest?” Gendro leaned over. 

Okin shook his head. “I don’t think *planet* is a synonym of *world* in ancient Terridian. But... a planet can’t *think,* or... have interest.”

Ateon chuckled. Okin shot him a glare... he didn’t have any more patience for these games.

He stepped toward him and waved the book in the vagrant’s face.

“Are there missing pages at the start? Or perhaps a version in *Trentanian*?” He asked.

“No, just what you have in hand,” Ateon replied. 

“Then how did you understand it? Only clergymen and scholars even learn a modicum of Terridian,” Okin said.

“Who says I understand it?” Ateon smiled.

“You quoted it,” Okin snapped dryly.

Ateon smiled and shook his head. “You got me there.”

“Well?” Okin raised an eyebrow. “How am I going to read this, when I can barely get past the first few sentences?”

“Well, you’re the one that wanted it. It’s not my fault that you can’t understand it,” Ateon replied.

Okin’s fists tightened. He instinctively let out a sharp exhale; he would not let thoughts of Wrath consume him. 

“Okay,” the High Ather shut the book and tucked it under his arm. “Thank you for this, Ateon. I will attempt to decode it on my own time.”

Ateon’s beard perked up in a smile. “You’re welcome, Okin. And it was very nice to meet you, Rothar Gendro.”

The vagrant stuck out a fleshy hand. Gendro paused, but finally, with a slight grimace, he took it.

Okin looked out into the sky. The magical walls of The Citadel were invisible in the night;   all that shone were distant torches upon the watchtowers, like dim fireflies. 

He held his own lantern as close as possible without burning his robe. This was likely the latest he had ever been out in the streets for years, and never in a destitute neighbourhood. The thrill of uncovering the conspiracy had shot through the bleak of night, but now it was no more.

“Come on, Gendro, we should be going now,” the High Ather said.

Gendro’s chin nodded over the illumination of his own lantern, and the two men set off into the silent street.

“Continue your diligence through the Darkness, Okin,” Ateon shouted from behind them. “And the Gods will reward you and the world for your faith.”

The sentiment actually warmed Okin’s heart, and he puffed his chest against the night. He held his lamp up high to ward off the demonic Darkness.
