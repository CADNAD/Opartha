## Background
### Early Life
Billy was born as in Metheno, Trenta, as Cynin ere Gruissem, to Lionen ere Gruissem and Malo ere Gruissem. Lionen was a middle class port trader who was a kind, almost naive man, and good friends with the very religious Ather Aldwin, and Billy was good friends with Aldwin's son, Previa, at a young age. Billy grew up having a happy childhood, mostly helping his mother with house work and his father on the dock and playing with neighborhood children. Lionen and Malo were very loyal themselves to Moden Versalism, until Lionen realized that his youngest son, Damin, was a Dark Herald. 

After the discovery Lionen became extremely closed and distrustful, paranoid that even his wife would drown the boy if she knew. He made Damin stay inside all day or made excuses to take the young child to his workplace, despite Billy's protests. Lionen grew distant from his wife and son, and Billy resented helping his father on the docks.

Unfortuntely, Lionen was not able to stop Billy from secretly taking Damin playing with other boys, one of whom was Okin ere Cantas, an extremely religious teenager who was in Rothar training. ! After Damin accidentally triggered his Dark Heraldry in front of Okin, Okin and Previa told Ather Aldwin. Billy and Damin ran home and told their father, while Ather Aldwin summoned the local Rothars to execute the boy. Lionen managed to secretly place Billy and Damin on a ship heading for the Kainen Republic, and then ultimately Apathasaw, before being interrogated and ultimately murdered by Aldwin's men.
### Apathasaw - Servant Days
Billy was twelve years old and Damin only five when the two arrived in Apathasaw. With no skills and no family, Billy began doing a combination of chore work for wealthy families and stealing to feed him and the young Damin. Around a year later, he got to know an older fellow servant, Harry, who discovered the young boy's developing Time Heraldry, and told him of a travelling circus that utilized many Heralds, even weaker ones, in shooting competitions. 

Billy adopted his father's same closed, protective parenting style, compounded from the guilt he felt from his indirect part in his father's death. He knew that Damin was much brighter than he was, and stole books for his brother to study from his master's house, but would never let him leave the shed where the servants slept, and would do extra work so the master would let Damian only do small house chores where he did not interact with other servants and stayed inside. Billy would often practice tricks with his Time Heraldry in his free time, and at sixteen, he left the house with Damin and found the circus that Harry had told him about.
### Apathasaw - Circus Days
Billy was accepted into the circus as an apprentice trickster and part-time servant, and the circus kept him and Damin fed. Despite not being the strongest Herald, Billy was extremely talented with muskets, which became his main acts in the circus. Here, Billy met Benjamin, who he nicknamed "Black Hole", on account of his skin color and role as a Space Herald in the circus, and the two became best friends. Finally sick and tired of being in the shadows all the time, Damin, against Billy's wishes, convinced the circusmaster to let him take part as a Dark Herald. 

However, Damin had a massive freakout during his first show upon using Dark Heraldry, which both screwed up the act and freaked out the audience. After the show, the circusmaster threatened and beat Damin, and Billy, enraged, shot the circusmaster's hand off. Billy and Damian escaped with Benjamin's help and planned to meet up later along the ! Western Coast of Apathasaw. Billy was twenty-one when they escaped the circus, but was not able to leave with any of the funds he saved up to settle down, and also return to Wreathward.
### Apathasaw - On the Run
Billy and Damin moved to the Western Coast, a more urban and chaotic region. Billy made a living for them mostly by petty theft, and they often moved town to town. Finally, Damin was fed up and Billy found him a more stable job as a cleaner at a unique tinkering shop, working for the Versalist god Giatro, while Billy did odd mining jobs.

Billy became addicted to alcohol, and his rage and outlook on life got worse as he was left with no friends, little prospects, hidden rage for what he saw as failing Damin, as well as not on track towards his goal of buying a ship ticket back to Wreathward to avenge his father.
