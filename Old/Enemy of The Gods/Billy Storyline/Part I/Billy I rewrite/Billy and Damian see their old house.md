*This* was the part of town that Billy remembered. Metheno had built up the outer sector, towards the coast and marina, in this modern, artsy style, but of course ten years wasn’t nearly enough time to renovate or rebuild the houses that had been there for generations. A few minutes’ walk inland revealed the cobblestone, moss-covered buildings that Billy had grown up around.  The butcher, the baker, the town guard and everyone else all resided and traded in buildings that looked ever-so-similar: stone foundations, wooden roofs, few windows. 

What *Billy* was looking for wasn’t here, though, and he kept his face even more covered by his hat now. He also swept Damian’s mop of hair over his eyes, and tightened his grip on the boy’s shirt.

He purposefully took the outer, gravel paths. His memory still served when it came to the geography of the town, and thankfully nobody walked this way. 

Finally, they reached the main road that led to the innards of Whenran and all that lay beyond. There was little but ample farmland and warehouses on either sides, with the occasional mansion or chateaus sitting centrefold.  They were one of the few who weren’t atop a horse or a carriage, and to his annoyance, Billy voluntarily stepped far aside as one passed, though the road was wide enough where it wasn’t necessary. 

Billy’s eyes rested aimlessly on the horizon, which was not far as the path was slightly hilly. In a way, he wished he never reached the end of this road just kept heading straight forever. 

And so he continued walking like a mindless zombie with Damian at his side. No matter how boring or repetitive the views were, Damian was always looking around, as he was now.\[ 2021-10-31, 12:08 PM

Possibly add Damian asking about how they will find a place to sleep and such, sun setting, and Billy getting frustrated because he doesn’t really have a plan for this part to tell Damian\]

So of course, he spotted it first.

“Hey!” Damian shouted, and tugged on Billy’s shirt. Deep down, Billy knew what Damian had found, but he continued to pretend like he didn’t hear the boy. Damian pulled and shouted again.

“Billy, look!” 

Billy jerked his head. Surrounded by a beautiful garden was a huge, rectangular creme chateau with several floors, denoted by the symmetrical pillars and windows. A tall iron fence separated the property from the road, and even inside a maze of short green hedges sat between them and the mansion, it wasn’t hidden at all, due to its massive size and height. 

Billy’s dead eyes peaked. The garden--- it was still maintained, in fact, it was *identical,* if Billy’s memory served. Not a single rose wilted in the flower bed, and it shot out like a rainbow. Damian also ogled at the mansion with wide eyes, though he didn’t hide his glee. 

From the right angle, Billy could peer through the gaps between the iron bars and the bushes, and he could see the two twin white doors that led into the manor. Into his old home. 

Walking along that old road with nothing to drink, Billy had felt like his mind had been pushed out of his body. And so, with no idea of consequences, he pushed on the iron gate. 

To his surprise, it wasn’t locked. There was a loud screech, and Billy stepped onto the property.

“Billy!” Damian shouted. “What are you doing?”

Billy didn’t even answer. He just stepped up the stone path, passed the green hedges, and stormed right up to the two creme doors underneath the marble pillars.

*Knock, knock.*
