Though it was Gendro who asked to come along, Okin still felt like he had to *push* him into the church.

“

Yes, Gendro’s attitude and nature seemed obvious at first glance, but Okin had the feeling there was something deeper. Okin had already seen how the Rothar presented himself around his Ather; despite what he said, he was actually quite Loyal. It was how Gendro interacted with others that would reveal his true character.

He could hear chatter coming from within the main hall. This room was colossal in height--- the stone pillars so tall it looked as though they were pencils holding up the roof although they were several metres in diameter. Atop the walls were beautiful tessellated glass mosaics, the ones on the outer walls depicting the lesser Gods, and the ones toward the back of the church depicting The Four--- Aredal, Intillia, Olitheon, and Nexon. \[ Add Descriptions? Short ones maybe\]

There were several dozen rows of pews, and several of the Athers already gathered up near the front of the church. It was one of the largest in the city, next only to the Four Cathedrals, and most likely the largest beside them in all of Wreathward. 

Okin walked down the main aisle with Gendro in tow. The gathering’s discussion grew louder as they approached. 

A middle-aged man, slightly older than Okin, wearing identical robes reached out a hand.

“I don’t believe we’ve met. My name is High Ather Breslo, I’m stationed here in The Citadel.”

Okin shook the Ather’s hand.

“Nice to meet you. I am High Ather Okin, and this is Rothar Gendro,” Okin smiled.

Before releasing his grip, Okin remembered what the strange beggar had told him the day before. *The next time you come near a member of the clergy, one of your fellow Athers or even an Impalias, attempt to access his mind. Stay near him, get a hand on him, and think about what he might be hiding from you.* 

Okin closed his eyes and focused on Breslo. What, if anything, was this man hiding from the world?

Absolutely nothing came to Okin’s mind.

Okin opened his eyes, and Breslo smiled awkwardly as he released his grip.

*Why did I think something stupid like that would work?* It was completely idiotic. The beggar, if he even meant *anything* by his ramblings, almost definitely meant that as an expression.

It didn’t matter much. Okin didn’t expect it to work in the first place, and he wouldn’t have come to this gathering if his only plan was to get close to random Athers and roll the dice on whether they were hiding something. No, he would follow the direct lead he already had.

Okin looked among the group of white robes for his young friend. Maneuvering around the aisles and through the pews, he finally found Previa. 

Before approaching, Okin leaned back and gave Gendro a stern eye.

“Don’t speak. If you have anything important to say, whisper it into my ear. Understand?”

Smirking, Gendro nodded.

The men around Previa looked befuddled, almost taken aback as the young Ather talked with a bright red flush.  Okin approached, interrupting him, and the other men regrouped into their own separate conversations.

“Hello, Previa,” Okin said.

Previa’s face cleared up a bit when Okin approached. A loud gasp escaped his lips.

“Okin!  Father’s been ranting about you all day yesterday. I understand it has something to do with Impalias Trenton and you staying in The Citadel?”

Okin nodded.

“Well, I’m just happy that you can stay,” Previa said. “I’m still a confused about why father is so angry, though.”

“Did your father say anything else?” 

Previa shook his head. “Not really, he just went on about how Trenton is too old and conservative, and how he’ll be happy to see me take his place, if I just learn a little more common sense.”

*‘A little’ is an understatement.*

“Previa, did your father mention anything else about the Fourth Book of Nexon?” Okin asked.

Previa looked up in thought. “No, I do not believe so.”

Okin lowered his voice, encroaching on the younger Ather. “Does Aldwin--- do you suspect your father is hiding anything from you?”

Previa scratched his chin. “No, I don’t see why he would.”

“Beside going to the Seat for meetings, does Aldwin ever leave the house?” Okin asked.

“Oh yes, all the time. He’s very busy, you know,” Previa replied.

Okin nodded. Despite his obviously ignorant statements, Previa was right: Aldwin was very busy. 

“If this kind of thing is what Impaliases spend all their time doing, I’m not so sure I want to become one anymore. I just wish that father stopped berating me so much, it wasn’t even my idea in the first place,” Previa said. They young Ather sat down on the pew and rested his cheek against his hand. Standing with crossed arms, Gendro raised an eyebrow to Okin, tapping his foot impatiently. Okin ignored him.

“Tell me,” Okin said. “What do you and your father--- squabble about?”

Previa sighed. “He always says that I need to take more initiative, to show more interest in the teachings of Moden Versalism and the religious texts. I do have interest! I want to *fight* for Truth and Justice, not just read and talk and judge. If only--- if only I was a Rothar, yes, like Gendro. And you told me to be Brave! If I was a Rothar, then I could fight for Truth and Justice all while showing my Bravery at the same time. If only I had been a bit older, that I would have the opportunity to become a Rothar during the Farsuniun conflict. If only--- if only I was a Herald, so that I would be the best of Rothars, so that I would be fighting for it all on the front lines.”

Okin took a seat next to his friend, who stared into oblivion, chin still resting on one hand. He had never heard this kind of talk from Previa before, in fact, Okin couldn’t remember the last time Previa had expressed displeasure besides some mild complaint about his father’s strictness or another small insignificance. 

“And it’s not true that I don’t show interest, that I don’t spend time reading or researching! I have read more about the Gods then many of the other Athers, or even him! It’s just, he reads the same mellow books over and over again, and I read about what truly made them *legendary*.”

Okin raised an eyebrow, leaning towards his hunched-over friend. “And what might that be, Previa?”

Previa looked up to Okin, confusion on his face. “Well the fact that they were Gods, Okin! They could do *anything*, they could live forever! They were *one* with the universe, they *were* the Forces!” Previa’s growing shouting drew eyes from the surrounding pews. “They could control the sun, the sea, the sky, the land, the shadows, the---“

“No, No!” Okin stood, his face red with fury, his hands flying through the air has yelled. “Power alone does not make one a God, does not make one legendary. Tregale, Deionis, they were immortal, they were powerful, but they were *not* Gods. They were *monsters*!” 

Previa’s face reddened as Okin’s cooled, but not from rage, instead embarrassment. Silence struck the room as all eyes fell on Okin and Previa. 

“I-I did not mean that,” Previa said. “I lost my mind for a second.”

Okin nodded, recoiling his arms back to his side as he realized how much attention he had attracted. From behind, he heard a snicker--- Gendro. He didn’t come here to stand up for the tenants of his religion and his beliefs or to humiliate his friend. In fact, he needed Previa’s trust and support now more than ever. Luckily, the young Ather was quick to forgive, and forget.

“I am sorry as well, for being so aggressive,” Okin replied. “It is just so easy to turn down many dangerous paths, and I do not wish for you to go down any, Previa.”

Previa nodded, smiling. “Thank you, Okin.”

The flock of eyes now turned back to their own smaller packs.  Okin sat back down, and both Athers relaxed their posture. “Previa, I need something from you. Actually--- I have a way that you can help me *fight* for Truth and Justice.”

Previa’s eyes perked up. “Yes, Okin?”

“Your father is hiding something, something related t0 this supposed Fourth Book of Nexon, an important truth that is being shielded away from the people of Wreathward. I need your help in order to reveal it.”

Previa’s glimmer faded slightly. 

“I need you to--- I need you to track your father. Find out where he goes during the day, during the night,” Okin said.

“So, I am like a spy?”

Okin scratched his chin. “I guess so.”

Previa nodded, a thin smile forming on his face. “A spy.”

“So I can trust you with this?” Okin asked.

“Yes, I will do it.”

Okin smiled, patting his friend on the back.  “Thank you, Previa. I am still staying in the visitors complex, I want you to come visit to report the findings every three days. Can you do that?”

“I will,” Previa said. 

Okin nodded, getting up from his seat. Gendro smiled as the two began their walk down the aisle. But as he started, an Ather stepped out of another pew, blocking his path. It was the man he had met earlier, Breslo.

The middle-aged High Ather smiled. “I heard what you said when you were talking to that younger Ather. You are right, there are much too many young radicals spreading dangerous ideals. There is a group of Athers, which I am a part of, that stand for the same sort of values as you, for the *greater* good. We need more members to support our cause, especially during this upcoming election. I think you would be a great fit.”

Okin was about to politely decline, but bit his lip as he realized how great of an opportunity this was. He needed more contacts in The Citadel, he needed to start to understand the hidden politics that he had been blind to for so long. 

He returned Breslo’s friendly smile. “That sounds great. When and where is this gathering?”

“Our next one is in three days. I will come by to your residence and pick you up,” Breslo smiled.

Okin nodded. *A bit strange, why doesn’t he just tell me where it is?* 

“I am staying at the visiting complex, in Unit 2,” Okin said. 

Breslo smiled. “Thank you, Okin. You are truly a man to look up to.”

They shook hands again, and once again Okin tried to focus on Breslo’s thoughts, on anything he was hiding.

As expected, nothing.
