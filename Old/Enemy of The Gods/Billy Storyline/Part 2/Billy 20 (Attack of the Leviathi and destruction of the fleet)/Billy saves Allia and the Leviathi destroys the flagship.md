Billy crashed back-first against the rail, his head hitting the wood. His neck wobbled, and his eyes grew from blurry to black.

Freezing water splashed over him, his shoulders lurched, and he jolted back to reality. His hands convulsed--- on the other side of the ship was a carved-out tear in the railing and the deck.

He stood up sharply. He *had* to find his brother. Nothing else mattered. Nothing else---

“Help!” 

Billy turned. Next to the gap in the banisters, Allia was clutching a wooden rail, her hands whitening with Light.

Billy looked past the masts to the other side of the ship. The population of pirates seemed sparse compared to before, and most of them clung to the masts. Where was Damian?

“Help, someone!”

Billy bit his lip and slowed Time. White-tipped crests froze around all sides of the ship. He’d never been able to make Time nearly stop like this, perhaps there was still some he borrowed from Kiatus through the crystal. Off in the distance, spikes flew in the air and he cold barely make out the dark outline of a segment of the Leviathi. He forced his eyes to scan the ship, but still found no sign of Damian. Finally, his sight landed on the glowing hands that reached just above the ship, still squeezing the rail.

No, she didn’t deserve to die.\[ comma, 2021-05-16 11:08 AM

Add more before this I think\]

Billy released Time and ran over to the rail, placing one hand firmly on the top of the banister. He leaned his body against it, inching one hand around the gap. The force of the wind slammed against his cheek, flaying more water into his eyes.

“Allia!” he shouted to the mass of hair below. “Grab my arm!”

The girl looked up, a ghastly fear in her piercing glowing eyes. A sharp gasp escaped from Billy’s lips, and his hand jerked back. Time came to a halt again.

*It’s not him. There’s nothing to fear.*

He pressed up against Time, and shoved his hand forward again. He forced himself ignore the burn of Time’s wrath. Her glowing palms clasped his and he finally released Time. He heaved her over the gap, clasping her shoulders to stabilize her once she landed on her feet.

The golden glow faded, and she stared at him with wide eyes.

“C’mon,” he released his grip. “We have to get the others.”

Billy felt at his pocket; the strange sensation of the Crystal filling him was gone, and he was left near barren again.

He tried to pull on Time, to see what he had left, and it reluctantly responded, awkwardly lagging to a halt. 

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the shadow of that massive tail. 

“Run!” he turned, his side grinding against the air, and wrapped his hand around Allia’s back to push her around. He leaped, still in Time Slow, his legs felt on fire, but the scaly end of the Leviathi’s tail was on track to slash them down lest he move with speed and precision that was only allowed in Time Slow. His mind was fogging away, the edges of his vision faded with the explosion of the deck crashing around him, and he heard the deep, drawn-out sound of the Beast’s tail demolishing the deck behind them. It was all background noise to the ever-growing buzz.

Time consumed him and he fell unconscious before hitting the ground.
