Okin crouched down behind the bushes. He could just make out the figures loading up on the street adjacent to the front yard. The armoured Devinar opened the carriage for Aldwin, and after the Impalias had gotten comfortable, the man stepped into the driver’s seat.

Aldwin’s yard was rather quiet, as usual, and there were other no guards in front of the manor, it was probably unnecessary with so many garrisons of Rothars nearby and on call. Plus, The Citadel had the lowest crime rates of any city in all of Wreathward, maybe all of Opartha.

After the enclosed cart had driven off in the opposite direction, Okin scampered around the grove then clumsily sprinted to latch onto the side of Aldwin’s house. Back to the wall, he slowly sneaked over to peer through the large window.

Previa was inside, sitting at the kitchen table, where a tall pile of books were perfectly stacked, identical in length and width. Okin recognized them instantly from the covers---they were religious texts. Previa had a book open in his hands, but this one was unfamiliar. The lad was alone, smiling.

Okin knocked his fist on the window.

Previa’s body lurched upward, and his eyes popped up from the book. The boy slumped back down as Okin waved through the window, motioning for him to come around the side of the house. The young Ather placed the book down and made his way toward the front door of the house. Okin left the window to meet him there.

The door swung open, and Previa had on his usual confused, childish look.

“Okin? What are you doing here?” 

“Speaking to you,” Okin whispered, inching into the house. “There’s no one else here, correct?” 

Previa nodded, biting his lip. 

Okin wrapped his arm around his friend’s back and gently pushed him into the dining room. His eyes scanned over the whole space, there was nothing out of the ordinary. 

He turned over the book Previa had been reading on the table. 

“*History and Battles of the War of the Gods,”* Okin said with ire in his voice. *“*Your father is having you read *this* as training to become an Impalias?”

“Uhm, well, no, he wants me to be reading those,” Previa scratched the back of his neck before pointing to the stack of books on the table. “I just find it interesting.”

Okin placed the text back down. “Your father is right. How do you expect to become an Impalias when you haven’t even read a hint of real doctrine?”

Previa shrugged. “Well, the War of the Gods is the most important event in Versalist history, is it not?”

“There is no *most important event*,” Okin said, shaking his head. “And don’t call it that.”

“Okay, okay. Shouldn’t I be researching the Betrayal, the Wrath of the Betrayer, and the Vanquishment of the Betrayer so I can learn how Aredal brought Justice against the Wrath of Tregale?” the young Ather asked.

Okin took the book that was on the top of the pile and flipped through it. It was just an ordinary copy of *Aredal I*, a text he had obviously read countless times. 

“Well, yes,” Okin said. “But *that---,”* he motioned to Previa’s book, “it isn’t about what’s actually important, and it wasn’t written by Versalist scholars. A lot of it is probably flat-out wrong.”

Previa clutched the book in his arms, and a small sputter escaped his lips.

“W-well--- what if the Versalist texts that are wrong?”

Okin dropped the book of Aredal from his hands. There was the mark of instantaneous regret in Previa’s eyes, and his arms folded inwards as if he was preparing for a physical blow.

“Previa! How could you even say such a thing?”  Okin shouted. 

The young Ather shook, scrambling to pick up the copy of *Aredal I* off the ground. His face turned a bright pink.

“I’m not saying that Versalism itself is wrong--- just some of the details of the texts. Like--- they don’t give a very accurate description of Tregale’s abilities, and why he was so destructive. Like, if the Four and the rest of the Gods were so powerful, why did it take them so long to beat him and Deionis?” Previa asked.

What was Previa’s strange obsession with this aspect of the Gods? It was *like* holy worship, but for the wrong reasons.

Okin’s eyebrows narrowed. “Tregale, Deionis, they are the *embodiment* of the Force of Darkness! Of course it would take time to defeat such a powerful evil!”

“And the Four are the embodiment of the other Four Forces. It seems like a four on one would be pretty easy,” Previa replied.

Okin buried his face in his hands and rubbed his eyes. “Previa, you are running to become an *Impalias!* What if your father heard this heresy?”

Previa slumped back into the chair, sighing. “I don’t know, Okin. I am just asking questions. I guess I don’t really mean what I am saying.”

*You better not be,* Okin thought. Okin knew that Previa was less conscientious when it came to doctrine and faith than the average Impalias, but he this--- this *heretical talk*--- it was *new*. Why was Aldwin pushing this uneducated, almost *blasphemous* boy for Impalias? Was it all for familial status? Okin still couldn’t wrap his head around it.

Okin shook his head, refocusing. He had come here to *learn* from Previa, not argue with him. He shivered at the possibility of Aldwin returning sooner than expected. Though he was furious at his former mentor, he didn’t know if he had the courage to confront him again, in his own house.

“Previa, has your father told you anything else about the Fourth Book of Nexon since we last spoke?” 

Previa shook his head. “Since that day, father and I have only talked about the campaign and my newfound duties. He acts like we never even discussed it.”

Okin scratched his chin. An acidic twitch poked underneath his skin; he felt a little deceptive relaying this conversation without telling his friend the whole Truth.

“Previa, I have it. I have the Fourth Book of Nexon,” he blurted out, and felt that uplifting feeling that one always feels when a difficult test of faith is passed.

Previa’s eyes widened.

“How did you get it?”  He asked.

“I... I met a very strange man, and he gave it to me,” Okin said. “But--- I’m not so sure about its accuracy. It is not like the rest of the *Versalist Onorun*\[ 2021-10-16, 12:41 PM

Replace later\]*.* For one--- it is all in Terridian. And--- even more ancient than the one we know.”

Previa looked from Okin to the ground. 

“Gendro and I are working hard to decode it. But--- from what I’ve read so far--- it is very--- odd. Perhaps I have not understood all it has to offer yet, as I can barely grasp the little context that I can understand.”

Previa nodded, but his eyes were troubled. Okin moved closer to get a better view of the boy’s emotions.

“Previa? Is there... is there something you wish to tell me?”

Previa gradually looked up, and his head trembled.

“Y-yes. I have an *idea.* But--- I am not sure that you will want to hear it,” Previa looked to Okin like a child uncomfortable with discussing an adult subject with his father.

“Well, sometimes the Truth is uncomfortable, for both the speaker and the listener. But, it is always enlightening,” Okin put a hand around his friend’s shoulder.

“There is a difference between Truth and opinion, though,” Previa said.

“Ah, yes. *Aredal II, XII, XLIII,”* Okin smiled, though he knew that there was a chance Previa wasn’t even likely quoting the passage. The young Ather had little motivation for his religious studies; he needed all the motivation he could get, and Okin would do his best to give it to him. 

“Uhm, yes,” Previa smiled back weakly. “Well, what I am about to say, I am saying it as my opinion.”

The young Ather took a deep sigh.

“You saying that the *Fourth Book of Nexon* was so unfamiliar--- as I was thinking about the differences and similarities between the *Versalist Onorun* and say,” Previa pointed to the book on the table, “*History and Battles of the War of the Gods,* for example. And, well---,” a look of mischievous inquiry appeared on the boy’s face. “Say--- what are the--- the--- *incongruities* you’ve noticed between the Fourth Book and the rest of the *Onorun*?”

Okin sputtered. He didn’t really know what this had to with Previa’s book.

“Well--- there are a lot. To be honest, I would not have guessed that the author was Nexon had I not been told. The writing style is--- different, more different than any of the Gods. Yes, I know that the Gods elected Revictus to record their Wisdom and Knowledge for the *Onorun*, and that is why the writing style has some similarities throughout--- and there is *no way* that this was transcribed by Revictus. But I would not think that Nexon would be such a--- *different* writer! And it is not in the way you would expect, Previa! His voice... sorry, *what is written in the book*, sometimes it is... *devoid* of Joy! And it is even more strange, because the times that it is *not* devoid of Joy, than he *does* sound truly blissful! I---“

“Okin, Okin,” Previa smirked, and Okin stopped himself, a mild blush on his cheeks.

“*Besides* the writing style--- what has he actually written about that is--- that isn’t in the *Onorun?*”

Okin nodded. “Well, there is a *lot* of meandering, and I’m only at the start. But--- for one, Nexon does *not* seem to have a great relationship with Olitheon. F-from what I can tell by the text, I mean. In fact, there is some...some...”

Previa stood up from his seat. 

“Some, *what*, Okin?” 

Okin let out a light gasp.

“I-If this Fourth Book really is real, then how can *I*, a mere mortal... *Judge* the *Gods?* But--- I cannot say it is definitively false, either, if I am being truly honest! I do not Know! But--- it is clear. By the text given to me, it is clear---“

“*What* is clear, Okin?” Previa asked with a hint of annoyance.

“Nexon--- from his writings--- he is *Envious* of his brother!” 

Okin huffed and puffed, like he had forced a rogue Ytternu\[ 2021-11-10, 1:49 AM

Possibly change for Soskatoo: Ytternus are heretical, and Okin wouldn’t mention them\] out of his mouth instead of just a couple of words. Though Previa didn’t even smirk, Okin could imagine how much Gendro would’ve laughed, and he calmed himself.

“Okay. But--- what of any--- are the any events*---* or--- just--- *things* that are *different*?” Previa asked.

“Yes! A lot is entered around these four--- I’m not sure what to call them, but it best translates to world-makers. It has not been yet described what they are, just that--- they have immense power, and there are Four of them. And--- and the Gods---“

“They use them,” Previa finished Okin’s sentence. “To enhance their power and aid in their miracles.”

“It is...” Okin’s voice quieted. “It is implied.”

Yes, now Okin’s mind was *screaming* it. He had done a lot of work to get it, and even a lot of work just to *read* it, but there was no way in Opartha the Fourth Book of Nexon wasn’t just some heretical nonsense. He should’ve done away--- 

“Aha!” Previa’s face was the most enthusiastic Okin had seen it in... well, *years.* 

“It makes perfect sense.”

*What?* Was Previa reading his mind? Did the boy finally agree with the obvious conclusion that their had to be something false or heretical about this Fourth Book?

Previa turned to Okin and gave an open-mouth smile as he stared him directly in the eye.

“There are records that of the Gods appearing individually,” Previa said, “all the way back to \[ iceisnice, 2021-11-13 7:48 PM

Check and confirm dates\]300 BA--- but strangely, all the *real*, history-changing miracles--- the ones that can be corresponded with similar events in the *Onorun---* didn’t really start turning up until around 170 BA.”

Previa’s gaze met Okin’s and his smile faded. He scratched the back of his neck. 

“Uhm--- from the *bits* of secular history I have read. I-I’m not entirely sure---”

“Previa,” Okin’s eyes narrowed and his voice deepened. “I have already expressed my opinion on you reading those texts--- but I hold no more Judgement for that. However--- especially as an Ather of Aredal--- do not present me with a false image of how things are.”

Previa’s lips quivered as Okin’s interruption ended. The young Ather lowered his head and sighed.

“I-I am sorry, High Ather Okin. Yes, I have read *quite* a bit of secular texts--- but it is *truly* because I only wish to increase my Knowledge of the Gods! They--- they are very informative--- and *diverse* in information.”

Okin nodded, and he sighed as well. He used his fingers to lightly raise the young Ather;s chin so they were at eye level once more.

“Do not be ashamed,” Okin smiled in an attempt to wipe Previa’s guilty look away. “I know that you are doing your best, and yes, the Path of Dedication always has its difficulties, but we must not falter.”

“I--- yes, I understand, Okin,” Previa looked down and nodded, and Okin let his hand drop. 

“I am beginning to accept my place in this world--- and it is an important one,” the boy said softly. A moment passed, and he looked up to Okin with a warm but determined smile. “I know that you and father have done all you can to prepare me for it--- and I finally feel that I am ready to get started. I know that he has deemed my mentor--- as have always been, and I know always will be. I hope to aid you in whatever important mission surrounds this Fourth Book of Nexon in return.”

Okin forced his head to stay put and not shake in anxiety. He had almost forgotten how he was playing this double front with Aldwin and Previa--- and both of them were *somewhat* in the Dark about each other. 

“I--- Of course, Previa. I apologize,” Okin gave a faux smile. “I do not have much time to mentor you at the moment.”

Previa’s smile faded, but he nodded in acceptance. “I understand, Okin.” 

Okin looked away, part of him couldn’t bear to see that childish moping of Previa’s. He shook his head wildly while Previa’s eyes were glued to the floor--- and remembered what he was *here* to do.

“Previa---“

“I will still give you my honest advice, though Okin, as you are right: not only is it my recompense for all your years of mentorship, but it is my duty. I believe--- I believe that you should see if what is written in that Fourth Book of Nexon is similar to anything in *secular* texts, if it does not resemble anything in the *Onorun.”*

Okin looked away in thought. Previa’s suggestion--- it was actually a pretty good idea. If these... *history* texts did corroborate the events in the Fourth Book... well, it wouldn’t *confirm* anything,  but it would be *something.* And right now Okin would do anything for *something*.

“Thank you for that, Previa. I--- I will likely do that.”

Previa smiled, and Okin did as well, though there was a heavy feeling in his gut. He thought about asking Previa more about Aldwin--- which was his initial plan--- but know, that was just to get a lead, and Previa had already given him one. 

He turned away from Previa; there were a nasty mixture of thoughts and feelings brewing from his gut. Tests of faith, feelings of *doubt.* Even though his faith in the Fourth Book hadn’t been strengthened--- strangely, now, there was a hint of doubt in the *Onorun* itself.

*No!* Okin pushed the terrible thoughts away. At once, he remembered a very passage from the sacred text warning him of this very phenomenon--- while doubt itself wasn’t one of the *Twelve Vosins*, Architor had preached it was often a cause of Treachery. 

“O--Okin?” Previa said.

It just--- it just didn’t make any sense! Was there a larger picture that Okin wasn’t seeing, only conceivable by beings as Wise as the Gods? But why would the Gods knowingly *confuse* a loyal worshiper like himself with such--- *contradictory* information?

“Okin?” Previa raised his voice, and Okin finally turned to the young Ather.

“Uhm, father is having a celebration for... well, for my birthday, but also to promote my run for Impalias,” Previa said. “It’s here, in two days, in the evening.”

Okin froze. He wanted to celebrate his friend’s birthday, but couldn’t honestly support his run for Impalias.

“I apologize, Previa,” Okin replied. “I am very busy, and I don’t think I will be able to make it. But--- happy birthday, my old friend.”

Previa looked down and gave a slow nod.

Okin reached over and patted his friend on the shoulder, and Previa gave a soft smile. It made him feel a little dirty--- a little *Deceptive.* 

But--- it was not a *lie.* Okin was *extremely* busy.

Okin returned to his pondering on the Fourth Book and the *Onorun*. Maybe--- maybe it was Okin *himself* that was the problem. After all, the *Onorun* had no contradictions, and Okin was the only one that had been exposed to this supposed Fourth Book of Nexon.

And while there was something *strange* about this Fourth Book of Nexon, it was Previa’s own father--- the strongest opponent of this book reaching the public sphere--- who had *confirmed* its existence. So it--- it had to be *real.*

But whether it was the legitimacy of the Fourth Book or the legitimacy of the entire *Onorun* in question, that seed of doubt within his gut had spread thin roots over everything. Now there were contradictions. Now somebody was *lying*, and Okin had to choose.\[ 2021-11-10, 1:43 AM
