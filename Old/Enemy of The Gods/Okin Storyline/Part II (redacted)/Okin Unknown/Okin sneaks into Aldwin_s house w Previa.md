Okin crouched down behind the bushes, only peeking his eyes over. It was hard to see through the steel faceplate, but he could just make out the figures loading up on the street adjacent to the front yard. The armoured Devinar opened the carriage for Aldwin, and after the Impalias had gotten comfortable, the man stepped into the driver’s seat.

Aldwin’s yard was rather quiet, as usual, and there were other no guards in front of the manor, it was probably unnecessary with so many garrisons of Rothars nearby that were on call. Plus, The Citadel had the lowest crime rates of any city in all of Wreathward, maybe all of the world.

After the enclosed cart had driven off in the opposite direction, Okin scampered around the grove then clumsily sprinted to latch onto the side of Aldwin’s house. Back to the wall, he slowly sneaked to peer through the large window.

Previa was inside, sitting at the kitchen table, where a tall pile of books were perfectly stacked, identical in length and width. Okin recognized them instantly from the covers---they were religious texts. Previa had a book open in his hands, but this one was unfamiliar. The lad was alone, smiling.

Okin knocked his fist on the window.

Previa’s eyes popped up from the book, his body lurching forward and upward. He slumped back down as Okin waved through the window, motioning for him to come around the side of the house.

The young Ather placed the book down, and made his way toward the front door of the house. Okin left the window to meet him there.

The door swung open, and Previa had on his usual confused, childish look. Some of the bruising on his face was still visible, although barely.

“What are you doing here, Okin? And why are you wearing one of those?” He asked, pointing to Okin’s gambeson.

“That does not matter,” Okin whispered, inching into the house. “There’s no one else here, correct?” 

Previa nodded, biting his lip. Okin closed the door behind them.

“I’ve been meaning to reach you, Okin. There was some commotion over at the visiting complex, I heard? Father was speaking to some men about it, and I asked him if anything happened to you, and he said nothing,” Previa went on.

Okin wrapped his arm around his friend’s back and gently pushed him along into the dining room. His eyes scanned over the whole space, there was nothing out of the ordinary. He turned over the book Previa had been reading on the table. 

“*History and Battles of the War of the Gods.* Your father is having you read *this* as training to become an Impalias?” Okin asked.

“Uhm, well, no, he wants me to be reading those,” Previa scratched the back of his neck before pointing to the stack of books on the table. “I just find it interesting.”

Okin placed the text back down.“Your father is right. How do you expect to become an Impalias when you haven’t even read a hint of real doctrine?”

Previa shrugged. “Well, the War of the Gods is the most important event in Versalist history, is it not?”

“There is no *most important event*,” Okin said, shaking his head. “And don’t call it that.”

“Okay, okay. Shouldn’t I be researching the Betrayal, the Wrath of the Betrayer, and the Vanquishment of the Betrayer so I can learn Aredal brought Justice by defeating Tregale?” the young Ather asked.

Okin took the book that was on the top of the pile, flipping through it. It was just an ordinary copy of *Aredal I*, a text he had obviously read countless times. 

“Well, yes,” Okin said. “But *that---,”* he motioned to Previa’s book, “it isn’t about what’s actually important, and it wasn’t written by Versalist scholars. A lot of it is probably flat-out wrong.”

Previa clutched the book in his arms, and a small sputter escaped his lips.

“W-well--- what if the Versalist texts that are wrong?”

Okin dropped the book of Aredal from his hands.

“Previa! You’re an Ather of The Citadel! How could you say such a thing?”  He shouted. 

The young Ather shook, scrambling to pick up the copy of *Aredal I* off the ground. His face turned a bright pink.

“I’m not saying that Versalism itself is wrong, just some of the details of the texts. Like---they don’t give a very accurate description of Tregale’s abilities, and why he was so destructive. Like, if the Four and the rest of the Gods were so powerful, why did it take them so long to beat him and Deionis?” Previa asked.

What was Previa’s strange obsession with this aspect of the Gods? It was the same as back at the church just a week before, when Previa’s eyes had lit up during his strange monologue. It was *like* holy worship, but for the wrong reasons 

Okin’s eyebrows narrowed. “Tregale, Deionis, they are the *embodiment* of the Force of Darkness! Of course it would take time to defeat such a powerful evil!”

“And the Four are the embodiment of the other Four Forces. It seems like a four on one would be pretty easy,” Previa replied.

Okin buried his face in his hands and rubbed his eyes. “Previa, you are running to become an *Impalias!* What if your father heard this?”

Previa slumped back into the chair, sighing. “I don’t know, Okin. I am just asking questions. I guess I don’t really mean what I am saying.”

Why was Aldwin pushing this uneducated, almost *blasphemous* boy for Impalias? Was it all for familial status? Okin still couldn’t wrap his head around it.

Okin shook his head, refocusing. He had come here to investigate something, not argue with Previa. He shivered at the possibility of Aldwin returning sooner than expected. The fact that Okin’s former mentor---Previa’s own father---was probably implicated in this cult, and most likely its leader, was still disturbing.

“Previa---have you found anything while investigating your father recently?” 

Previa shook his head, batting his bruised eye. 

“He’s just really been doing normal meetings, and spending most of his time at the Seat. And to be honest, I’m a little scared going out after---you know, what happened last time,” he replied, scratching the back of his head.

Okin nodded. He didn’t blame Previa for being afraid, although of course this further went to show that Previa was at a very low level in all aspects of his Dedication. Although, Okin himself had been terrified after being surprised by those strange beak-masked men, he was very much in the same position as Previa when it came to Bravery. He shivered instinctively, but quickly straightened himself. They were likely the same figures that Previa had encountered, and in a way, Okin was still responsible for their death. Since he had gotten here, there had just been so much *death.*

“I am still sorry for what happened last time,” Okin said, rubbing his chin. Perhaps it was time to let Previa off the hook, his information wasn’t proving so useful anyway, and he had been hurt. But, there was one upside to having Previa on this goose chase--- it would distract him further, and maybe even drive a wedge between Aldwin and his son which would hurt their election campaign.

However, looking at the boy with his bruised eye, Okin knew he couldn’t do that. Previa had suffered enough, and Aldwin had proven his ruthlessness with Breslo’s death. Would Aldwin go so far as to harm his own son?

“You can stop investigating your father,” Okin finished. 

Previa’s face scrunched up. “Ah, it was somewhat fun being a *spy*, as you called it.  However---why were we investigating father in the first place? You and him have always seemed so close.”

Okin froze. There were a multitude of answers to this question, but none of them could come out, at least not in their complete, unfiltered form. But---he would keep his course to the Truth.

“I---I do not know if he has your best interest at heart,” Okin said.

Previa raised a surprised eyebrow, popping up in his seat. 

“Father? Why would father not have my best interests at heart?”

For a second, Okin considered telling the boy to just drop out of the election. The plan was likely too straight-forward and stupid, though, and would likely just end in Okin getting in trouble.

“I believe he may be connected to those strange figures who attacked you. Just---be wary of him,” Okin said.

Previa’s eyes were still wide, and he just nodded. 

“I---“

“Previa, do you mind if I take a look upstairs. In your father’s room?”

“Well, uh, I guess so. It’s upstairs, on the right,” Previa replied. “You’ll need the keys, though. They’re in the drawer over there.”

Previa pointed to a cabinet, and Okin pulled it open, snatching the lone iron key within. He gave a nod of thanks before leaving the kitchen, and then walked up the carpeted steps to the upstairs hall. He creaked open the door on the right.

It was a nicely furnished room, filled with books like the study of an Olitheon Dedicant. In fact, it did look like a study, fitted with a desk and chair, which both emitted a sun-like glow. There was ample room to stand, even with the king-sized bed at the edge of the room.

Okin moved to the bookshelves, placing a finger on the wall of spines, most unmarked, seeing if he recognized any. He pulled out a few at random, many were historical texts. Maybe this is where Previa had gotten that book about the battles of the Gods. It didn’t seem to be anything special, and he didn’t have time to even read the first page of each book. He scanned the room again. There was nothing else damning here, in fact, the floor and walls were pristine, spotless. 

Sighing, he scrolled through more of the books. He pulled out another, and a small rattling sound followed. 

Okin put the book down. In the gap where it used to be, a small, purple crystal laid instead.

Okin pinched the crystal into his palm to inspect it. He walked up to the open window to get a better look, and the amethyst overlay shined brighter in the light. Okin had only seen these a few times before, they weren’t very useful for a non-Herald but could be sold for a hefty price. He had personally never had the desire to possess one, like most normal people, which included Aldwin, at least to Okin’s knowledge.

What was Aldwin doing with a Space Crystal?

Staring at it closer, Okin doubted his own Knowledge. Maybe this wasn’t an ordinary Space Crystal? He barely remembered with they had looked like, he knew they were slightly brighter and more purple then the Forbidden Crystals, but hadn’t seen one in ages. Maybe this was something else?

Okin bit his lip as he opened his pouch. It was so small, Aldwin wouldn’t notice it missing, would he?

The crystal fit snugly into the pouch, alongside Billy’s strange gun.

Okin turned to leave the room, checking again to make sure he hadn’t missed anything. He hadn’t.

He shut the door quietly, making his way back down the stairs. Previa was still reading his book in the kitchen, despite Okin’s complaints.

*Maybe this is what I want. If Previa is too caught up in whatever* this *is, he won’t have time to focus on becoming an Impalias.*

To be honest though, Okin still didn’t think Previa had much of a chance anyway. Perhaps he just didn’t want to argue the point further.

“Previa,” Okin said, and the young Ather looked up from his book.

“I am going now. Do not tell your father that I was here. Just pretend like you haven’t seen me. You---you haven’t told him we’ve been meeting, right?” Okin’s eyes widened.

Previa nodded. “Well, no. But---this feels a bit like lying, Okin.”

Okin’s hand tightened into a fist and his wide eyes drew away from the boy. He heard his own heart beating as he re-pictured Aldwin on the stage, shouting, as Breslo’s dead body hung lip from the tip of the spears.

“Well, it might *feel* a bit like lying. We are being secretive, that is true. But we are doing this for the greater good, for the Truth and Justice of The Citadel,” Okin said.

Previa’s looked upwards in thought. 

“Uh-uh---what does that even mean, Okin?”

Okin turned to the boy, and shook his head in dismay. He then placed an arm on his shoulder.

“We are doing this for the greater good, Previa. Not just for our own personal record of Truth, but for the Truth and Justice of *all* of Versalism.”

Previa’s eyes now darted to the corner. It didn’t seem like Okin’s repetition cleared anything up.

“Can I trust that you will keep this between us?”

The young Ather looked back up to Okin. A few seconds passed, and then he nodded.

“Of course, Okin. I hope I will see you around soon.”

Okin smiled, and released his hand from Previa’s shoulder. The young Impalias candidate gave a soft smile in return.

Looking into Previa’s youthful eyes, Okin promised himself that he *would* prevent his old friend from becoming an Impalias. It was his duty.
