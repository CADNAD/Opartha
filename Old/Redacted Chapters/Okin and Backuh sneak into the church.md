The bearded hobo was already waiting atop his pothole.

“Hello, Okin,” he said, before the Ather had even opened his mouth. “Stylish new look.”

“So, what am I doing here tonight?” Okin asked.

“Hey, hey, not just you, *we,”* the beggar said. “This is very much a team endeavour.”

Okin rolled his eyes. 

“Well, *we* are breaking into that church you discovered last night.”

Okin’s jaw dropped. Breaking in? How? They didn’t have a key, the only person they knew who *may* be there was Breslo, and if he is going to be there, then there are sure to be guards! Why would they even attempt such a dumb move, they didn’t even know if there was anything inside the church!

“Why in Aredal’s name would we do such a thing?” Okin yelled.

“Well, you said there were conspirators there, planning against The Citadel. The only way to find out what they are doing is to break in to one of their so-called gatherings,” the beggar replied.

“Well, how do you even know that there is one happening tonight?” Okin asked.

The beggar looked up, scratching his chin as he stood up. “To be honest, I don’t. But we’re going anyway,” he said with a cheery smile.

Panting, Okin followed behind. The streets were dark and empty, and the dirty vagabond didn’t even bother to hide or check his peripherals for Rothars or other strangers. He walked with more confidence then most Athers receiving an increase in their Dedication.

“Well, I don’t really know where it is from here,” the beggar chuckled. “Why don’t you lead the way?”

Okin stopped. He didn’t want to do this, it seemed high-risk, low reward. But he found himself leading the strange vagrant towards the church.

The two men crouched outside the graveyard, looking in towards the side church. The two Rothars, same as yesterday, walked with a torch in hand alongside the side of the church.

“C’mon. Stay by my side, and follow my lead,” the beggar said, rushing over to the graveyard. Okin followed, and the both men hid behind a headstone.

“Wait for it,” he whispered, the guards turning right to walk around the front of the building.

“Now,” he threw something from his hand, and it flew towards one of the large church windows, smashing the glass on impact.

*Must’ve been a stone. But where’d he get it? He must’ve picked it up from the ground when I hadn’t noticed.*

“Guards!” Okin heard shouting from inside the church. “Something broke through the window! It’s cracked! Help!”

He heard a thumping sound near the front entrance where he had eavesdropped from earlier. 

“Follow me,” the beggar whispered, sneaking quickly through the graveyard towards the front entrance. Okin crawled along the headstones as fast as he could, dirtying his hands and outfit in the muck.

The bearded beggar came to a halt several yards in front of the entrance, watching the front of the church behind a thick stone pillar at the edge of the graveyard. The two Rothars were banging on the double doors violently, trying to get into the locked building.

Finally, the doors were opened by an Ather from the inside, and the two Rothars rushed inside, leaving doors ajar.

“Now! Go!” The vagabond whisper-shouted, hopping over the fence which enclosed the graveyard, quickly slinking towards the entrance. With a little less grace, Okin placed two arms on the gate, as he hopped over. Part of him was really glad he wasn’t wearing his old robes. He followed the beggar’s steps as quietly as he could.

The beggar slipped through the crack in the door, and Okin had to push it forward a little to get inside. Hopefully they wouldn’t notice the difference. He heard men shouting from the front of the church, yelling about the shattered glass. 

The beggar quickly crouched behind the last pew, motioning for Okin to join him. The Ather obliged, peeking over the pew in attempt to see the group of conspirators.

Like the rest of The Citadel at this time, the church was shrouded in darkness. Okin could barely see beside the small row of candles in front of both rows of pews at the front of the church. The building relied on natural light seeping through the windows, which of course there was none of during the night. It was unexpected that anyone would be at church at this hour.

Strangely, like before, Okin’s vision was sharp in the darkness. Not only had he seen the beggar’s motion to him, but he could even see the men near the front of the church that weren’t in the small circle of light created by the candles, granted, they carried small candles of their own.

“I’m not sure, it just broke open!” One of the men shouted. “What could it have been?”

“Where’s the glass?” Another asked.

“Here, I can see a few pieces on the ground,” a third said. “Watch your step.”

“Whatever it was, it came from the outside then,” the second responded.

The beggar stayed completely silent, perfectly still for the entire conversation. If he wasn’t staring directly at him, Okin would have forgotten he was there.

Loud stomping came from the front of the church, the scraping of metal boots against the hard floor of the aisle growing closer. Once again, Okin closed his eyes, praying he would not be seen. This time, it wasn’t even a guess as the train of footsteps pounding did not stop as it passed the two intruders.

“Follow me,” the beggar whispered, as he sneaked forward, rushing through the aisle to the left side pews, turning right as he reached the outside aisle. From the outside aisle, he continued towards the front of the church, his steps rapid yet silent. The gap between Okin and him widened until the beggar reached the front pew, stopping.

Okin’s ankles and thighs ached as he continued to sneak on his tiptoes while crouched. Nearing the front rows, he began to crawl until he reached the beggar, crouching behind the outer barrier of the second pew. 

On the other side of the church, the cult members were still fretting about the broken glass, staying awkwardly still. Okin watched them, trying to make out any recognizable faces in the dim light. He caught Breslo among the group, but the other five were unrecognizable, although they all wore robes of Versalist clergy.

Okin almost jumped as something rested against his shoulder. It was the beggar’s hand.

“Stay here, stay silent. I am going to see what this strange gathering is all about.”

Before Okin could say anything, the beggar dashed off, running past the first pew, through the small area where a group of candles lit the floor, and towards the altar. On the other side of the church, next to an identical row of candles, the cult members didn’t notice him, probably keeping their eyes on the floor as to avoid pieces of glass.

Okin looked towards the altar, which was encompassed by tall candles on all four corners, lighting up the white table cloth of the altar, and some area of the surrounding ground, but still leaving most of the room in darkness.  Ever so strangely, Okin could almost make out the furniture and artwork lined around the walls that surrounded the altar,  even though they was no light to see them. Stranger yet, Okin had completely lost sight of the beggar, who must’ve been somewhere near the altar.

A thin hand reaching up behind the altar confirmed his suspicions. It snatched at the lone book sitting near the back of the altar. The beggar disappeared back into the darkness, sneaking down the steps of the apse, and stepped back into visibility as he passed the row of candles in front of Okin.

“Let’s go,” the beggar said as he approached Okin’s side.

“I want to hear what this meeting is all about. That’s why we came here, is it not?” Okin said.

“I already got something that will tell us that,” the beggar replied.

“What if that’s just an ordinary Versalist Bible? The only we can find out what they’re really doing is to sit in and listen,” Okin said.

The beggar turned Okin around, holding him by the neck of his gambeson, getting close enough the side of his face to bite off his ear, and Okin could feel the old man’s his beard prickle the side of his neck. “Do you want to be here when the guards return? What if they start looking around the church for intruders? What happens when those Athers return back to the altar and find their book is missing? We have to go *now.”*

The beggar let go of Okin, who nodded sheepishly. The two men sneaked down the side aisle back towards the entrance of the church. 

The beggar held out his hand as they reached the end of the aisle, stopping Okin in his tracks. Seconds later, the Rothars came stomping back into church, running down the main aisle.

A few seconds after they had passed, the beggar released his hand.

“Now!”

The two men rushed to the church doors, the beggar pushing the right one open for Okin to slide through and out. Okin ran with the beggar out of the church property, and the two men stopped to take a breath once they had reached the street.

Okin leaned over, panting with his hands on his knees, and the vagrant chuckled, slapping him on the back.

“You did well! It’s funny because you looked like a scared little dog going in there, and then once we were inside it was like pulling a dog off of a fresh piece of meat.”

Okin looked up to the bearded man, who looked nearly invisible in the night. His eyes narrowed as anger began to brew within him.

“What’s even in that book?’ Okin asked.

“I’m not so sure, I haven’t read it yet,” the beggar replied, smiling. “Something about that cult we just ran into, I assume.”

“Then how do you know it will tell us what we need to know?” Okin yelled. “I just risked my life to get that book and you don’t even know what it is!”

“Shhh, quiet down now, quiet down, do you want us to get spotted?” The beggar said, clutching Okin. 

The fire within calmed itself, and Okin’s glare softened. The man was right: Okin couldn’t afford to be seen out at night like this. Yelling about their situation would do nothing.

Standing up, Okin faced the vagrant. “When I agreed to help you investigate The Citadel--- the institution which I have dedicated my *entire life* to--- you promised me you would share with all the information we uncovered. I want to see that book.”

The beggar chuckled. “Yes, yes, of course Okin. I will read through it, and then it’s yours.” 

*It’s always ‘one more step’ or ‘in time’ or ‘after we do this’ with him!* 

“No. No, I want it---,” Okin paused. It looked as if the beggar’s eyes were feed into his him. The iris was so dark it was indistinguishable from the pupil--- or the pupil consumed it? And the intense darkness, along with the beggar’s black, stringy hair seemed to mask the sclera, or did the pupil really consume his entire eye?

“F-Fine. I’ll come fetch it tomorrow,” Okin said. 

The beggar smiled, showing his crusty, chipped teeth and the optical illusion disappeared as a small bit of light sneaked through from above.

“Goodnight, Okin,” the beggar said, placing an arm around the Ather. “Believe me, we will free The Citadel of corruption. It will take lots of commitment, and maybe even sacrifice, but we will do it.”

Okin nodded, staring again at the bright star of Aredal that ignited the sky. 

*We better. I feel I have sacrificed enough as it stands.*
