**The Great Watcher:** A size-changing raven-like bird with a light grey beak. It has high intelligence and uses its stealth and abilities to watch over humanity. It has decided to “assist” humanity instead of rejecting, attacking, or merely attempting to stay away from it. However, it sees humanity as a long project of sorts and is not afraid to kill if it means preserving the human race. However, it is very cautious and understands that revealing its nature and abilities unnecessarily may be dangerous, and thus intervenes conservatively. Recently it has “teamed up” with Revictus to prevent Tregale from returning. 

Once, a high-ranking member of Revictus’ order discovered The Great Watcher communing with Revictus in secret, and Revictus and The Great Watcher realized they couldn’t completely keep their relationship secret entirely anymore. As such, Revictus commanded that the order “worship” TGW, and presented him as a wise and quasi-all-knowing messenger of the Gods who was sent to protect humanity. From that day forward, the order designed masks that resembled the face and beak of The Great Watcher.

The Tneranotos \[*Nur-an-o-toss*\], also known as the *Tehwa Kanura* by its inhabitants, is a massive, flying reptile with a wingspan of several miles. It has dark red skin, which appears very veiny along its wings. It’s body is thin and long, and its underbelly, while solid, vulnerable compared to its topside, which is covered in rocky spikes that are functionally similar to small mountains. 

The Tneranotos has gill-like openings on its side and face which not only help it breath at a higher elevation than most other creatures, but release a fog-like byproduct that is almost indistinguishable from a cumulus cloud. This cloaking mechanism often surrounds its entire body, and this is why many, including its own inhabitants, believe that the creature is a Liquid and Gas Herald. This is also further backed up by the fact that the Tneranotos somehow warms itself and its surroundings as a byproduct of its own breathing. 

The inhabitants of the Tneranotos are a religious cult known as the Tsuman Monastery, a small sect of the 

They have a symbiotic relationship with the beast, and ensure its civility with a large team of Mind Heralds, constantly working to sooth and influence it. In return, they often hunt birds that will claw at the beast’s back, and sometimes even feed it.

The Tneranotos also has a predictable migration pattern, which has been memorized and harnessed by members of the Monastery. It is unknown whether anyone outside their ranks has knowledge of its migration behaviour. The members of the Monastery are known to utilize and live inside the large rock spikes of the Tneranotos, and have terraformed much of its back. Whether through soothing or a lack of nerves, the Tneranotos appears indifferent or even welcoming to their activity.
