## 1 BL: Arrival of Probes and Creation of Heraldry
The Azkani send probes to scan Opartha for the Heraldic gems. However, the probes' radar technology releases radiation that causes intense activation of mutated genes in the few Oparthans which get close, primarily human, but also animal. The animals and humans that were initially affected did not have the antibodies to the virus that have now been developed for all wildlife and thus became much more powerful Heralds. The radiation also spreads the virus to the wildlife.

### The Ducere brothers search for other Heralds
The Ducere brothers are granted Time and Space Heraldry which allow them to scout the world at lightning speeds. They quickly find other probes, and individuals who were affected.

### The Circle is formed
The Ducere brothers find the first members of the Circle, being around 50 heralds in total. Some are obviously more powerful than others, due to how their genome reacted to the radiation, and the amount of radiation they received. The Circle decides they should destroy the probes.

The Circle, as well as all Oparthans, are more potent users of these then the aliens.

### Vianarya Decimated
The alien ship releases a deadly radiation which lays waste to the continent of Vianarya, killing nearly all the wildlife and most of its native population. The Circle, as Heralds, have now developed the antibodies which fight off both the radiation and the virus which infected all the aliens, and are thus immune and flee. They are flabbergasted by this development and attribute it to a curse of the aliens, and a few superstitious members, led by Intillia, believe it was from spirits. Filip ere Ducere begins to study this to find the cause in case it occurs again, after disposing of the alien ship with the other members. The most potent Dark Herald of the group, Linos Janvier, also believes it was

### The crafting of the Heraldic Hosts
The heraldic hosts were crafted at the Forge using the alien technology as well as the five special gems. They allowed a person to artificially gain extreme powers over all aspects of a single Heraldry, or significantly amplifying the powers of a Herald of said Heraldry.
