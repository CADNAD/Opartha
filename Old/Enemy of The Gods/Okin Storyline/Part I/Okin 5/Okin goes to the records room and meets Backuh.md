Aldwin was right, Okin was tired; though not as much as he actually expected himself to be considering the length and speed of the journey. Perhaps his subconscious understood the fact that Justice could not wait any longer.

He strut straight across the Straeiht ere Olitheon, one of the Four central roads of The Citadel, and turned onto the curved road of Revictus. The avenues of the minor Gods were much still made of fine material, but paled in comparison to the beautiful pavement of the Four Straeihts, where not a brick was chipped or painted different. The men and women who turned the gears that held up the invincible walls of The Citadel made themselves more apparent here rather than the carriages that mostly occupied the main Straeihts.

A part of Okin wanted to take time to admire the construction and unique ornaments of the military barracks and political headquarters as he did on his first visit, but it was all a blur to him now. Though the second ring which the Straieht ere Revictus ran along was mainly reserved for military and government buildings, most the people that passed him were merely commoners.  The dirt-faced, rag-clothed children popped against the shining armour of Rothars and Devinars, and the golden collars of the other Athers.  Okin’s face probably looked more like the former at the moment.

He checked around as he strode; he was pretty sure he remembered where the records building was and it made sense for it to be on the street of Revictus as a wealth of records would be associated with Knowledge. Still, it was easy to get lost amongst these dense, bustling roads, even at an hour this late.

His eyes caught the bronze plated sign that read *Supreme Documentation Centre of Wreathward.* Much like the majority of the information inside of it, the building was gray, dull, and bulky, though maybe it seemed even more so due to the dark sky surrounding it. A multitude of armoured Rothars guarded the front doors. Their open faceplates were lit up by the torches they held. Even more guarded the bolted-down single door a few paces farther. That would be the records that weren’t available to the public. 

The Rothars nodded to Okin and stepped aside to let him through, and he returned a polite nod. Entering the building, he passed guards on the other side. One was patting down and checking the belongings of a short man attempting to leave the building.

The inside of the records room was almost as dark as the outside; the few windows didn’t let much light creep in this late, and the lamps were few and far between. Most were held by men who moved along the endless shelves that were filled with plain-covered books.

“Is there something specific you’re looking for today?” Okin shivered, startled by the polite voice. 

“Oh yes,” Okin smiled weakly back at the gangly man who held a lantern. “I’m looking for...dock records. From the port of Metheno from the month of,” Okin scratched his chin as he did the math in his head, “Archil,905.”

“Docking records from the port of Metheno from the month of Archil, 1005,” the thin clerk repeated, and Okin nodded as to confirm. “I’ll be right on it.”

The clerk dashed off to the back, leaving Okin alone to the vast arrrays of shelves of records. It all looked like blank nonsense to him, but he sauntered through, looking about as if it was a boring museum.

“What are you looking for?” This time, Okin jumped. It didn’t help his panic that the rows were dark and narrow.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you,” Okin turned his head to see a hunched-over figure in a black cloak shuffle out of the dark corner. His beard and charcoal hood looked almost as scratchy as he sounded.

“It’s alright,” Okin replied. “I was looking for some dock records, but a clerk is helping me with that. I’m just wandering around right now.”

“Dock records?” the cloaked man asked. “I don’t know many Athers who own shipping businesses.”

“I don’t,” Okin said. “It’s not about the income records, I’m just trying to confirm whether or not someone was at a certain place at a certain time.”

“Who’s this someone?” the cloaked man raised a bushy eyebrow.

Though he was never unsure when it came to telling the Truth, it still urked him. Back at Ariska, the most uncomfortable Truth he had. to admit was that he didn’t enjoy someone’s clothing or the like.

“The Synodontis of the Xing Empire,” Okin replied. His mind still rumbled when mentioning the title. Even without this accusation from Billy, the Synodontis was a controversial figure. There was even mutterings among his fellow clergymen that the man should be worshiped as a modern God. While Okin was firm in his belief in the Versalist canon that the Gods were all holy aspects of the Forces who brought themselves down to Opartha all at the same time over a thousand years ago, still hadn’t made up his mind about whether the Synodontis was the biological son of, well, his God. Aredal *was* the human form of the holy Force of Light... but did any of the Gods really *reproduce*?

“Umm...Ather?” Okin shook himself out of his meanderings. The clerk had come up behind him to hand him the records he requested.

“Thank you,” Okin smiled at the clerk. 

“I’ll be back once you’re ready. How long do you think you’ll need it?” the clerk asked.

Okin scanned over the two pages. “It shouldn’t take longer than a few minutes.”

The clerk nodded. “Be sure to tell me if you need anything else,” he bowed a little before leaving Okin in the row alone.

Or, not. The cloaked man had retreated back into the shadows and was coming out again. Okin ignored him as he crept up, his eyes were focused on the logs.

Most of the ships documented were trade ships from other provinces in Wreathward, as expected. He knew that if Billy’s accusation was true the Synodontis would most likely arrive the week of the murder--- important figures didn’t usually stay out of their homes long--- which was the third week of the month. 

But there wasn’t a *single* Imperial or Beisanian ship recorded docking in Metheno during the entire month. Okin slapped himself on the forehead. It was actually, ironically, Billy’s father who owned a portion of the dock, along with other Methenin residents who were boycotting the Empire’s tax and trade policies and not letting their ships dock in Metheno. In a way, this was the little bit of motive that backed up Billy’s accusation, though it still seemed insignificant and pity for the most powerful ruler in the world. But of course there would be no Imperial ships in Metheno during this time. 

“Something wrong?” the cloaked-man looked over Okin’s shoulder at the records.

“There’s nothing. And even if there was, I’m not sure if it would mean or prove anything,” Okin sighed. “Not a single Imperial ship docked in Metheno the entire month.”

“What if he--- went by land?” the cloaked man croaked.

Okin’s eyes widened at the man’s dirtied face and beard. He sprinted out of the aisle. His searched for any clerks. The one who had helped him earlier was keeled over in an aisle across the way.

“Sir,” Okin strut over to him. He held out the dock records. “Thank you kindly for fetching me these records. If you don’t mind, may I please see the--- the Whenranish border records from Fort Isla and Fort Lanson, for the month of Archil, 905?”

The clerk smiled and took the logs from Okin’s hands. “Whenranish border records from Fort Isla and Fort Lanson for the month of Archil, 9o5\[ 2021-08-09, 7:08 PM

Check date\]?” he asked. Okin nodded. “Coming right up.”

The pounding of Okin’s heart revived itself. Perhaps there was hope of something yet. He returned back to the aisle where the cloaked man was still snooping around.

“Sorry for leaving you so abruptly, and thank you for the great suggestion,” Okin said. He couldn’t exactly tell because of the dimness and the scruffy beard of the man, but it looked like the hairs and the edges perked up in a smile. 

“No problem,” the man said. “Uhm...would you happen to spare some...uhm... food, or change, or---“

Okin’s jaw dropped. “Are you--- homeless?” 

“Well--- I have a home,” the cloaked man stepped back. “But--- well, I could use some change or food, yes.”

Okin blinked. “Well, I’m sorry, I don’t have any food, but I do have some coins.” He dug in his satchel and pulled a few nickel steltells out of his coin pouch. “Here you go.”

“Thank you, thank you,” the beggar bowed and slid the coins off of Okin’s palm onto his own.  His wet fingers ran against the golden triangle on Okin’s palm which still shone a bit in the utter darkness. They touched Okin’s hand for a bit longer than the Ather would’ve liked.

“*Both the small acts of generosity* and *greed send ripples throughout the world, and throughout oneself. A man who gives away all he has gives*\[ 2021-08-03, 2:26 PM

Perhaps “grows” instead?\] *his spirit more than he can imagine,”* This time there was no mistaking the beggar’s fuzzy smile. *“*From Nexon, but surely you know that, kind Ather.”

*I... do not recall that line.  I believe I would remember it, especially if this man does.  Perhaps he is misquoting, or mistaken.*

“And from which book of Nexon is that line?”  Okin asked, leaning down.

“Well, Book Four, of course!” the bearded man laughed.  “Surely you are just fooling me, Ather.”

“Nexon Four?  I’m afraid there is no such thing,” Okin replied.  

The beggar shook his head.  “I am certain.  I just finished reading it!”

Okin’s eyes narrowed.  *This man must be insane. There is no Fourth Book of Nexon.  It would not be surprising, many men who live like this end up mentally destroyed.  I pray to Nexon and those Dedicated to him that together we may lift men like this out of poverty. For now...perhaps there is a way that I can help lift him back to sanity.*

“You *just* finished reading it?  Do you... have it on you?” Okin asked.

“Why yes I do! Though I wouldn’t show it to you now. These clerks don’t exactly like men walking around with ripped pages, the concern of stolen records and all that,” the beggar said.

Okin just nodded. Now he was curious about how this man could have mistaken whatever he had for a Versalist text.

The beggar turned his head back to the shadows, and Okin turned around at the sound of footsteps behind him. The clerk had the records he had requested in hand. 

Okin’s eyes scrutinized them. There was a brief description of everyone who passed the border gate, though understandably the guards wrote in shorthand.

*Dawn--- Carriage, two men, young, Trentanian. Going to Fort Renkal for Rothar training. Approved.*

*Midday--- Carriage, middle-aged couple, two children, Whenranish. Immigrating to Bassatia. Approved.*

Okin flipped the page. His eyes widened upon reading a more lengthy line in the middle.

*Dawn--- Three Carriages. Old Marthian man in the first, claims to be Beisanian. Several Imperial guards on horseback. Silver-haired man who claims to be the Synodontis of the Zhen Empire. Appearance adds up. No reason stated for travel. Approved.*

“Thank you, that’s all I need,” Okin handed back the records to the clerk, who bowed before leaving again.

He rapped his fingernails against his skull. So the records proves that the Synodontis was in Whenran at the time? It didn’t *confirm* Billy’s accusation, no, it could’ve been just a good scapegoat knowing that he was in the area--- but still.

The beggar his head back to Okin. “So what’d it say?”

“He was there. He crossed the border,” Okin nodded. “Thanks again.”

“Good you’re looking into the Synodontis,” the beggar itched his beard. “Can’t be up to anything good, claiming himself as the son of Aredal and all. He’d have to be, what, a thousand years old? I don’t know, what do you think, Ather?”

Okin glanced behind himself. His head hurt every time this subject was brought up; rightfully so, he knew this was beyond his comprehension, and its importance far dwarfed his Knowledge.

“I struggle to believe that he is a God. I do not know whether the rest of his claims are true, but if they are not, they would sure be sacrilegious,” Okin replied.

The beggar nodded, and Okin could see a hint of a smile under that bushy beard. “It is funny, how The Citadel has had such a monumental decision lingering on their doorstep for over a decade, and it seems that it has been somewhat ignored for years.”

“Well, there is no decision to be made by men like you or me,” Okin said. “Only the word of the Gods could be accepted in a matter such as this.”

Now, there was definitely a smile. Okin could see it in the man’s eyes. 

“And what have the Gods told you? Have you heard them?” His question had a hint of mischief.

“They will speak through the Mouth of The Gods, of course,” Okin scrutinized the man. “Perhaps they have chosen to stay silent for now because this verdict is less crucial than men like you presume it to be, or they do not believe the world is ready to hear the Truth. I do not know, and I already feel guilty for attempting to understand the genius of the Gods.”

The vagrant laughed. “Don’t you Dedicants of Aredal believe that the Truth should always be spoken?”

“Yes, I do. As I said, I would be a fool to try to dissect the will of The Gods with what little worldly information I am given,” Okin smiled.

The vagrant shook his head like Okin had told a crass joke. Then he motioned for the Ather to pull in a little closer.

“I can take you to see the Fourth Book of Nexon now. Though I still doubt that you’re not pulling my leg, Ather. Doesn’t seem very Truthful of you.”

“I promise you I am not,” Okin whispered. “I am very curious to see what this supposed Fourth Book is.”

The beggar slid past Okin and stood on his tiptoes. He looked out at the thin windows above them. 

“Then we should be going soon, it is dark now,” the beggar said.

Okin followed the strange man out of the records hall. Two Rothars guarded the exit from inside with flickering torches.

“Keep it away, keep it away! You can search me all you like, but keep the torches a good lengths away. I don’t like fire, and these are the only clothes I have” the beggar said. 

“Whatever,” the guard said, and motioned to let both Okin and the beggar pass. 

Even as they left, there were still two Rothars guarding the entrance from the front. One of them stopped as the two shuffled out onto the street.

“Wait a second,” the Rothar said to the cloaked man, who backed away and hid his face from the flames of the man’s torch. “I had an extra long shift and I saw you enter at dawn. You’ve been in there...what? Fourteen hours?”

The beggar just chuckled before continuing on. “Something like that.”
