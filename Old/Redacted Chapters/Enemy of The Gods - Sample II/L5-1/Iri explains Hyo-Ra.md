“Wake up! It’s time for morning roll call!”

Peng’s youthful face faded into view as Liu awoke to the feeling of his shoulders being shook. 

“Sorry I had to wake you, but I don’t want you to be late,” Peng said. 

Sitting up, Liu rubbed his eyes. Peng was already dressed, and Liu had slept with his uniform on. 

“Well, at least you don’t have to change again. Let’s go!”

Liu followed a dashing Peng out of the room and down the steps of the dormitory. Recruits were running ahead of them, towards the open field, the early-morning overcast was not much of an adjustment to his eyes.

Towards where Peng was running, past the stone square, was a line of soldiers, and a commander pacing in front of them. Liu assumed that was where Peng was heading, but Peng ran past that group, towards three other lines of soldiers in the distance. 

Peng came to a halt as they reached the third line. Liu stopped behind him, and he noticed that the line consisted of the other boys he had seen at the dinner table the night before, and Iri stood before them. At his side stood two other men, younger than Iri but older than any of the recruits, who were dressed in black tunics.

Peng took his place on the nearest spot in the line, standing so straight-backed with his arms at his side that it instead fo looking professional, it came off as goofy. Liu stood next to him in a more natural position.

“No surprise you’re late. Were you guys sucking each other again?” the boy to Peng’s left, two to the left of Liu, whispered. Liu checked his peripherals. It was Khan.

“Nah, we were taking turns getting some from your mom,” Peng replied back just loud enough for Liu to hear.

“Okay, now that everyone is here, I’ll be going over today’s routine for the new recruit,” Iri shouted to the row of boys. Leaning towards Liu, he said, “I realize I may have forgotten to tell you about morning roll call, but I’m happy you got here.” Returning to his original volume, Iri once again addressed the squad. “Because we have a new recruit, once again, we will be spending the entire morning doing the only training I enjoy, one of the only useful things we do at this academy--- Hyo-Ra.”

Peng’s fake stoic look morphed into a wide smile. 

“After that, it’s meal time. Then, we’ll be studying herald tactics until dinner, and then it’s chore time, and then bed when the sun’s bottom touches the horizon,” Iri shouted. 

“March to the training site!”

Iri led the way with the two strangers at his side, Liu second in line, leading the troop of boys farther west on the field, towards the strange assortment of battlements and tents. 

Iri stopped in front of a circular stone structure. on the southern side of the field, the shadow of the structure covering himself and the two dark-robed strangers. Attached to the wall of the structure beside him was a wooden ladder, leading up to the roof of the structure. Turning around to face the boys, he held out a hand, forcing them to stop.

“Now, besides the new recruit, who here has never practiced Hyo-Ra?” Iri asked.

Four of the other boys raised their hands. Both Khan and Peng kept their hands down.

“Okay good, so this explanation won’t seem as useless,” Iri said. “Now, before we get started, I must admit I enjoy Hyo-Ra, and I don’t doubt that many of you will come to enjoy it as well. Saying that, don’t be foolish and assume that this is simply a game like Tallow or Boosi.

“Hyo-Ra is an intense match of skill, a game of overarching strategy as well as small-scale tactics. Every strength and every flaw you carry will make themselves clear, and it is a match where you must learn your opponent and his flaws to get the edge,” Iri said. “It challenges your resource management, your ability to think on your feet, your tactical ideas and organizational skills, and most importantly, your capacity for war.”

“And the best part is,” Shi grinned, “it’s all done with a bunch of tiny, unsuspecting animals.”

One of the men at Shi’s side raised his hand, his fingers moving wildly through the air. Before his feet, glowing violet wisps appeared, forming together to create the shape of a small, four-legged creature. Seconds later, the creature brought itself to life, the purple mists still glimmering around its skin. 

So they are dark heralds then? I’ve don’t think I’ve ever even seen one before. Fascinating.

It was an ugly thing, it had no eyes, a large, wet pink snout, and wrinkly hands with sharp claws on the ends.

“Aren’t you a cute little guy,” Iri said, leaning down to pet the furry creature; As his hand lowered, the creature poked its nose up, violently sniffing the commander’s hand.

Most of the recruits looked away, disgusted. One of the other boys who had raised their hands asked, “What in Isana is that thing for?”

“This,” Iri replied, pointing back down to the mole-like creature, who stood on its hind legs in an attempt to sniff his hand once more, “This is your backbone. Without them, you can’t get money, and without money, you can’t improve your army.”

The boy looked even more confused. “How do these things help us get money?”

Iri grinned. “Well, come inside and I’ll show you.”

The troop of boys, along with the two dark-robed men and the lone creature followed Iri into the small building. There was just enough space that the boys could line the inner wall of the structure while Iri and the two stood in the middle. The floor was the same as outside: short, yellow grass ontop of dirt. The large entryway which they had come to faced away from the rest of the battlements and structures; the only thing visible through it was endless field.

“In Hyo-Ra, you must pay to buy more troops and upgrade your forces- which we will get to later. To accumulate the capital to upgrade said forces, you must first collect the coins which are buried under this dirt,” Iri said, tapping his foot on the ground. “And that’s where these little guys come in.” Pulling a coin out from his pocket, Iri bent down, holding the coin towards the creature’s face. After the creature had sniffed the coin, Iri pulled it away, and held it behind his back. The creature’s nose continued to twitch, and then it dug itself into the ground, its hands throwing up dirt as it tunneled face-first. 

The boys waited for a minute or so as the creature disappeared down its hole. Liu was surprised to see it poke its nose out from a different hole which it had formed by coming back to the surface. 

The creature quickly waddled back over to Iri, a dirt-covered silver coin sticking out from its mouth. It dropped it at Iri’s feet, and then turned back towards the dirt.

That is quite remarkable. I wonder, is this an animal in the real world that they are simply imitating, or is this function exclusive to Dark Heraldry?

“You can take it back now,” Iri said, and the man who had summoned the creature nodded. With a snap of the fingers, the creature’s body was enveloped by the purple mist, which itself slowly disappeared.

Iri turned to the boys. “There are both Delmian silver and gold coins under this ground, buried at varying levels by our trusty Solid Heralds. For the purposes of Hyo-Rya, Delmian silver is worth one and gold is worth five. The number of coins buried for each game is random, but both sides will have the same amount of coins at their starting base. You can assign your moles to either Delmian gold or silver- but be wary, there is much less gold underground.”

Liu looked down to the hole which the mole had dug. So, it’d probably be wise to start off with gold moles, but you’d never know for sure when you’d have to switch over to silver. Interesting.

Almost as if he was reading Liu’s mind, Iri made his next point. “Now perhaps you are wondering what will happen if- or more likely when- the ground seems like it is running thin. Well, that comes to the next use of moles- and the other crucial unit of the game, the parrot.” Iri nodded to one of the men, who raised his hand, fingers flying, and from the ground the glowing violet mists formed a small bird. 

Iri continued, “The player can only stay inside the tent, meaning he is playing a game with very limited information. Now, the parrot assists the player in negating both of these downsides- the parrot can provide the player with vital information regarding the state of the battlefield, and help him chart out a route to secure a new tent--- where there will be plenty of coins for his moles to find. And best of all, parrots can be given commands to direct to your other units.”

“Now, unfortunately, parrots aren’t people, and they’re only trained to answer a few questions--- what was on the battlefield, approximate tent locations, and a few others you’ll find later. The parrots can be taught in-game, but this is a very risky tactic.”

Iri grinned. “Parrot One, how many humans can you see around you?”

The parrot flapped its wings, and then spun in a full circle before landing. 

“I can see... fifteen humans,” the parrot squaked.

Liu flinched backwards, the stone wall behind him stopping him from moving further.

An animal that can talk? And moreover, effectively respond to questions? Dark heraldry holds more power than I would’ve ever thought.

Iri smiled at the shock of several of the boys. “Now, as much as I love explaining, I think we’d all have a little more fun watching,” the commander looked over the squad of boys. “Hao... and Khan, you two have both played before, so you’re going to have a match while the rest of us watch and the newbies can learn.”

Khan and another boy, tall and thin, stepped forward from the line. 

“Hao, you take this base, Khan, go to the other home base, and the rest of you come up to the roof with me to spectate.” 

Khan left the building, followed closely by one of the dark-robed men. The rest of the boys followed Iri out, the ectomorphic boy staying inside with the second Herald.
