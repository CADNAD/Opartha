Out in the distance, the crystal-clear blue waters crashed against the rocky coastline, leaving behind white foam which slowly dissipated away.  Overhead, he heard a cawing sound. Five or six small black birds were gliding over the ship.  

Narrowing his gaze, Billy’s surroundings smoothly slowed down.  The rushing waves became more like a still pond, and the gusting winds which made Damian’s hair and the captain’s beard flap around violently instead held them still in the air towards the East.  But Billy’s gaze focused on the birds, the usual blurry flapping slowed so he could observe each powerful thrust of the wings, each keeping the sleek body balanced and high in the sky.  He scrutinized the more subtle flap of the tail, which propelled the birds forward in a sharp thrusting motion.  Avians, which were normally so smooth and continuous in flight, like it was all just one continuous motion forward, looked as rigid as a man chopping wood at this speed.

With a short blink, everything returned to normal and the birds quickly flew past the ship and out of sight.  The waves continued to crash violently against the ship and each other, and once again the hairs of the crew traveled in all directions from the blowing wind.

For a few more minutes Billy stood there with Damian, the two men watching the waves crash against the coastline to the north, which was drifting in and out of sight. 

“Look at that!” Damian shouted, pointing to a large frigate, similar in size and build but with many more sails.  It went along with the eastward windand with the waves, but yet was still going slower than their own ship, which was travelling against both the current and wind at the moment.

Billy scanned the surrounding ocean in a panoramic fashion. There were a few other ships travelling eastward, and a smaller cargo ship trailing them from a mile back behind them. Damian got up on his tiptoes, placing his hand over his eyebrows and leaning forward to get a better view of the horizon.  

“I think---I think I see it!," Damian shouted, pointing northwestwards.

“What?" Billy replied.

Billy squinted towards where Damian was pointing, and slowly fading into view was a massive wooden deck, with several boats parked alongside or hovering nearby.  

“That...that’s the dock that we left from," Billy said grimly.  

“Yeah, I can just vaguely remember," Damian replied.

“How come you only remember shit when it’s useful to you, and the rest of us have to waddle through our memories, pretty or not?" Billy asked.

“I was only a kid, Billy," Damian replied.

“You say that like you aren’t still.”

Damian continued to stare in awe at the surrounding waters, and the coast which was now clearly coming into view.   Soft, sandy shores were revealed by the retreating waves, and deeper inland Billy could make out grassy hills, green and luscious.  

“I sure don’t remember Wreathward being this beautiful," Damian said.

“Maybe, but ain’t gonna trade nice grass and pretty water for freedom and hard-earned money," the booming voice of Benjamin said as he walked up next to Damian, giving him a pat on the back.  

“Hey, Benjy," Billy said.

“Hey, Billy.  Well, here is destination.  Damian’s right, it pretty, but still don’t make sense why you pay so much for me to smuggle you over here for two days,"  Benjamin said.  

“It’s none of your business, Benjy," Billy replied. 

Benjamin laughed.  “I respect your privacy, Billy.  I hope short trip, whatever you do, is worth it.”  

The frigate grew closer and closer to the dock, and Billy could soon make out the smaller ships which were parked there.  

“We’re here!" the captain yelled.  “Slow the engines, cut the sails, and prepare to attach!”

The large man with the long blonde beard got up from his seat and made his way to the centre of the ship, rolling in a long rope which was attached to the sails.  After some struggling, the sails collapsed inwards, and stopped fluttering in the wind.  The lanky dark-skinned man made his way down the steps of the ship, and soon enough afterwards the ship slowed down noticeably.  

There were a multitude of boats and men, both of which contained wide variety among them.  There was only one other vessel that looked quite the size of Benjamin’s crew’s frigate, and likewise it was well-maintained and likely a steam-sail hybrid.  There were many other ships that Billy recognized from his childhood, smaller and entirely powered by sail.  He remembered his father telling him about barques and brigs, and was pretty certain that the medium-sized ships with three masts were barques, but not entirely sure.  

Coming to a stop, the ship slid into the dock smoothly.  “Another happy landing!" the Captain shouted.

“You hear that Billy?” Damian asked, eyes wide.  “We’re here!  We’re home!”

Standing up from his leaning position, Billy replied, “This ain’t our home anymore.”  

Silvio frantically came up from the lower deck, and he was soon joined by the blonde-bearded man who had released the sails.  Getting up from his leaning position, Benjamin walked over to join them.

Giving a nod, the slender man and the blonde-bearded man lifted up a long, wooden platform, around three inches thick, over their heads.  The platform had large metal hooks on both sides.  

“You got it?”  the slender man said towards Benjamin, who gave an affirmative nod.  Like he was releasing a bird into the sky, the thin man loosened his grip from the platform, and the blonde-bearded man followed suit.  But instead of the platform falling on their heads, it gently rose upwards and forwards, until it was hovering above the small bit of water in between the ship and the dock,  controlled by Benjamin, whose hands carefully directed the wooden board.  Gently he lowered his hands, and the platform followed, and with slight finger movements the platform tilted a bit upwards, so that the hooks on the shipside of the platform hitched onto two rings on the side of the ship.  Lowering his right hand precisely, Benjamin moved the plank downwards so the hooks on the other side perfectly slid through two rings lined up on the dock.

Clapping, the two crewmates smiled at Benjamin’s performance, as Damian's mouth hung open in an excited wonder.  Crossing his arms, Billy said, “Why didn’t you just attach the hooks to the side of the ship and he just lifts it up onto the dock?”

“I like to see Benjy do his magic," the lanky man said with a grin.

“Two weeks at sea is too much," Billy said, walking towards the platform, Damian following closely behind. 

“Wait," Benjamin said, stepping in front of Billy’s path.  “The money.”

Sighing, Billy shimmied through his pockets until he found a wad of paper cash, and counted through it, handing Benjamin a dozen or so. “Here.”

Benjamin spread out the money in a fan with his massive hands.  “I only count one and half.”

“You’ll get the rest after the return trip," Billy replied.

Benjamin scoffed.  “You still do not trust me?  What, you think I’ll get crew to leave early and leave you here?”

Billy pointed a finger directly into Benjamin’s diaphragm.  “No, I’m worried you’ll spend it all on a piece of ass and whine about it to me for the entire return trip.”

Laughing furiously, Benjamin moved aside and gave Billy a playful push on the back towards the platform.  “Get out of here already, Billy!”  

Grinning, Billy gave a short wave to Benjamin and the crew, and Damian gave a more friendly variant.  

“Oh, and don’t get drunk and be late!  We *will* leave without you!” Benjamin shouted, pointing at Billy.
