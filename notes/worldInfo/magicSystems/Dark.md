# Branches

All branches have access to and utilise the dark dimension in order to create their powers. But Mind herald's power do not allow them to enter the dark dimension.

## School of Creation

- Store summons in the dark dimension
- They can summon these at any time. Some summons can retain memory, but all retain memory of the original function
- The summon design must be physically possible. Heralds study biology to find this out

## School of the Mind

- Requires physical contact, or a path of shadow 
- Can take control of a person's mind
- Can read a person's thoughts. The Herald will get what the person is currently thinking of and can read all senses

## School of Illusion

- Illusion Heralds can create a bubble around themselves. On the outside the bubble is lower in definition, while on the inside the illusions are more powerful.
