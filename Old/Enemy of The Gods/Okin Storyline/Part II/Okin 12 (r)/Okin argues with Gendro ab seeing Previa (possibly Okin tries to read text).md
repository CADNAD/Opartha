“...the...people of Ti-ron... do not have... forward... minds.  The people of Ti-ron... one... level... forward... animals.”

Okin raised an eyebrow.  He had to read sentences several times, and sometimes change the grammar and look for possible synonyms and even just decode some of the words he’d never seen before. It was gruelling, but he *would* understand the message between these pages soon enough. At least he’d gotten noticeably better from just reading a few dozen pages.

So far from his understanding, it appeared to be written by Nexon only a short time before the War of the Gods. But the tone was... *jarring.* It wasn’t always written with the joyous, enchanting voice of the first three books. There was a lot of  unnecessary meandering, and he spoke with a philosophical, almost *removed* quality. 

And the events detailed within--- Okin hadn’t heard of any of them before.  He wrote about arguments between people Okin had never heard of, but were obviously powerful Heralds. It--- they had to be the Gods; they all resembled them, at least in description. It was obvious their names were different in ancient Terridian, but Okin assumed he would have heard these alternate titles before. 

Of course, Okin understood that the *Versalist Onorun* couldn’t include *everything* that the Gods did on Opartha during their immense lifespans, but this... it didn’t even resemble *anything* in the Versalist texts. 

And Nexon... he didn’t--- he just didn’t *speak* in a *holy* manner. Okin wasn’t as sure about ancient Terridian linguistics, but he could’ve sworn there was some *profanity.* The text--- it just didn’t seem real.

But... Aldwin had acknowledged it. And what motive would Ateon have to fabricate a fake text of this length, all ancient in Terridian?

Okin sighed. No matter the blaring signals in his head yelling at him to burn it, he would have to keep reading. But for now, a weight off his chest would lifted when he slammed the book shut and stuffed it into his satchel.

Okin busted out of the room and slammed the door. He lurched back--- the strap of his satchel had got caught in the doorway. 

He grumbled. To his anger, he heard a mischievous little chuckle.

He snapped his neck toward the sound, just as Gendro stepped forward to open the door and release Okin’s bag.

Okin’s mild rage turned into surprise. The sun had barely risen; he expected the Rothar to be napping.

“Good morning, High Ather,” the Rothar smiled. “What do you have planned for today?”

“I’m going to speak to Ather Previa, see if he knows anything else that can help us,” Okin replied. He moved past Gendro and started walking down the hall.

Gendro raised an eyebrow. “Where have you arranged to meet him?”

“I--- I have not. I know that Aldwin has already left for the Seat, but Previa is likely studying at Aldwin’s manor. I will meet him there,” Okin said.

Gendro caught up to Okin and pulled his shoulder back. Frankly, the High Ather was a little taken aback by the gesture.

“You said you would not commit any espionage against Aldwin. You’re not going to break in, are you?” Gendro asked.

“Calm down, Gendro. I will not be doing anything of the sort. I am only visiting my friend and colleague. If Previa does not wish to see me, I will leave him alone,” Okin asked. Okin looked away from the concerned emeralds of his Rothar. He grimaced a little before asking what was on his mind.

“Are you on my side, Gendro?”

Now Gendro was the one who was taken aback. He scoffed. “Of course! I am doing my best to ensure you stay within the Values of your Dedication! Do you... do you not want me to come along?”

“Well...,” Okin sighed. “No, I do not. I see no use in having you present, and I believe that Previa will be less inclined to relay his knowledge if others are around.”

Gendro nodded solemnly. “I understand. Just--- for some reason I don’t trust that man we met last night, Ateon. I am afraid he will coerce us to take measures too extreme.”

“It was just one recommendation, Gendro. And he stopped after I told him that was not an option,” Okin replied. 

“Still... I just... I don’t like him,” Gendro muffed is lips like a child who just admitted he hated a rival.

“I don’t understand why you detest him so,” Okin said. “His... clownish attitude reminded me of you, in fact. I thought you would get along.”

Gendro shook his head. “We aren’t alike, Okin. Do you even know what he---“

“Is it his appearance?” Okin interjected. “I am somewhat convinced he uses it as a front, but---“

“Of course it isn’t his appearance! I am a Dedicant of Nexon, Okin! Why would I ever judge one for being less fortunate than myself!”

“I... I apologize for insinuating such,” Okin replied. “I just frankly can’t understand. You... you agree that this mission is crucial, do you not?” 

“Yes, yes,” Gendro nodded. “I am only concerned that his methods are... *contradictory* to the Values we hold dear!”

How could one man speak like a jester, yet also be... so over-bearing and concerned? No matter. It wasn’t Gendro’s duty to question Okin, it was his duty to support and protect him.

“Well... perhaps you are right,” Okin replied. “There is something going on with him, and I will find out what it is. But--- *I* will handle this matter. You are my Rothar, not my caretaker.”

“I think we both know that I could never be your caretaker even if for some outlandish reason I wanted to be,” Gendro smirked.

“In a way, that is true,” Okin said with a straight face. 

Snuffing his train of thought, Okin focused on the matters at hand. His stare returned to his Rothar, and he put a hand upon him. 

“As your Ather, I humbly request that you spend your time researching,” Okin had to make a concession, and although didn’t feel right about it, he didn’t let it show on his face. “Here,” he opened his satchel and pulled out a book--- the small, scraggy, Fourth Book of Nexon. 

“Take it,” he said. “Start where I have left a bookmark, and record the translation on paper. I know your Terridian likely isn’t so sharp, but you can take out some books that will assist you in translation from the Cathedral. Above all--- do not lose it.”

Okin tried to look into Gendro’s eyes, but the Rothar just stared at the floor. He nodded, like a pup who had just been disciplined. Okin patted his shoulder and turned to leave.

As he left the building, he felt a little pang of guilt in his heart. Well, another small yet necessary Sacrifice in the name of Truth, Bravery, and Justice.
