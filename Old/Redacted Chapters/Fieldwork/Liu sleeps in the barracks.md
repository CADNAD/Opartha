Liu ogled up at the tall, stone building.  He had read much about this place, but had never seen anything like it before.  

“Watch it!”  A loud, commanding voice screamed.  Liu snapped out of his trance and looked straight ahead.  He realized that his horse had bumped into one of the soldier’s.

“I apologize, I wasn’t paying attention to the road.  That was my mistake,”  Liu said to the soldier.  

“Stupid fucking Delmian," the soldier muttered under his breath as they kept riding.  

Shi An heard the commotion, slowing down slightly so his horse was in line with the soldier’s.  He whispered quietly to the soldier, commanding him to be more polite to the new recruit.  Then he slowed down some more so he was in line with Liu.

“Don’t worry about the soldiers.  We’ve been on a long journey and they’re very tired.”  Shi An pointed up to a small window on the stone building.  “That’s where you’ll be working tomorrow, Liu.”   Liu glanced up at the window, but then quickly looked back to the road again.

The horses all slowed to a halt and the soldiers started to get off their horses.  They had arrived at the soldier’s barracks.  It was a large, grey brick building with iron bars for windows.   It was one story tall, and could house around one hundred soldiers.  Around back, there was a stable for the horses.  While soldiers led their horses to the stable, Liu looked to Shi An for directions.  

“I guess you’ll be staying here for a little while until you can find your own place to stay.  There is lots of room and it’ll cost you nothing.  You can find an empty stable to store your horse, there should be space," Shi An smiled at Liu.

Liu nodded.  “Will I see you tomorrow Mr. Shi?”

“Yes, I’ll be in front of this building at sunrise, and you’ll get started with your new job.  Now go store your horse away, then we’ll inform the Sergeant that you’re staying here.”

Liu followed the last of the soldiers, and found an empty stable to store his horse.  The mare neighed as Liu led it into the stable, and stared at it’s new master with curious eyes as he left the stable.

Shi led Liu inside the barracks.  The room was decently well kept, and contained around twenty iron-frame beds that were each around 5 feet apart.  The soldiers were removing their armor and placing it on an armor stand that was next to the head of each bed.  Many soldiers turned around and gave Liu confused looks; it was obvious he was out of place as he was wearing farm rags.  Shi An approached a man with a shaved head and a scar across his left cheek. 

“Sergeant Chao, this is Liu.  I just hired him today, and I was wondering if he could stay here for a few nights until he earns enough money to find his own residence?”

The Sergeant gave Liu a quick look and then focused his eyes back on Shi’s.  “It won’t be a problem at all,"  he replied in a gruff voice.

Shi smiled warmly.  “Thank you Sergeant," he bowed, and then left the barracks.

Once Shi left the room, awkward silence stirred as more soldiers started to notice Liu.

“Choose an empty bed," the Sergeant gestured to a few beds in the corner that were unoccupied.  

Liu carefully examined each bed, and then chose the one in the center.  It was slightly more clean than the other two.  He started to straighten out the sheets.  After a few seconds, the Sergeant left the room.

“He looks like a Delmian farmer," one of the soldiers a few beds away from Liu whispered to his fellow squadmate.  He had a scar over his left eye.

The man whispered back, “What the fuck is a Delmian farmer doing here?”  

“What the fuck you doing here?” the first soldier shouted towards Liu.  

Liu turned around to address the soldier.  “Didn’t you hear earlier?  I was just hired by Mr. Shi as his new assistant, but don’t have a place in the city yet.”

“You don’t look like a government worker.  You look like a farmhand.”

“I worked on a ranch the past month, Mr. Shi hired me today.”

“Oh, so now they’re hiring everybody, even stupid, dirty delmoks?”  The other soldiers snickered.  Liu raised his pointer finger to make a counter-argument, but was cut off by another soldier.

“I don’t even know why the Empire is having us here to try to integrate you people?  Maybe our scientists need a couple monkeys as test subjects?”  

The soldiers roared with laughter.  Liu waited until the laughter had died down a little, and then raised his finger to make an objection.

“Actually, I’m-”

But he was instantly cut off by one of the soldiers.  “Hey look!  The monkey talks!”  The soldier’s laughter filled the room once again.

Liu raised his voice so the soldiers could hear him.   “Actually, I’m in support of the Empire.  I think that Delmia is quite foolish to oppose integration into the Empire, as obviously the Empire has a much stronger economy and military than Delmia.”

The room became silent.  “And I thought Delmoks didn’t like liars," the soldier with a scar said, the words spitting through his teeth with antagonism.  

“I’m not lying.  The Empire has clearly-”

“Shut up.  Just shut your stupid Delmok mouth," the soldier continued with hostility as he walked towards Liu.

“I support the Imperial Army’s efforts-”

With pure hatred, the soldier swung his fist in a quick hook motion, his knuckles colliding with Liu’s left cheek.  The impact caused Liu’s palate to slide over his jaw, which caused intense pain and an unpleasant cracking sound.

Some soldiers gasped in shock, while others leaned in to see the action.  The attacker raised his fist to strike Liu again, but stopped when he heard thunderous footsteps approaching from the other room.  

“What the fuck is going on here?”  The sergeant shouted at the crowd of soldiers.  They all looked at him in silence, and the soldier with a scar shifted towards his own bed.

Liu rubbed his left cheek in total shock of what just occurred.  *What did I do to deserve that? I wasn’t lying, and I support the Empire and the Imperial army.  Why would an Imperial soldier attack me for holding that position?*  The questions piled up in his head, but he was unable to answer any of them.

The sergeant’s eyes scanned over the soldiers.  “I asked you, what the fuck is going on here?!”   The loud scream of the sergeant caused Liu’s thoughts to break.  He slowly raised his hand  to tell the sergeant the events.  

*No! If the soldiers attacked you for supporting the Empire, they will likely do much worse if you tell their superior that they committed a felony!*  Liu quickly lowered his hand.

“Alright, everybody get where you’re supposed to be, in your fucking beds!  I didn’t know that you babies need me to turn off the fucking lights for you!”  

With haste, the sergeant marched over to every candle in the room and blew it out.  The soldiers all laid down in their beds, and Liu followed suit.  

The room darkened until it was pitch black.  The sergeant marches out of the room and into his quarters.  Liu’s mind raced, the adrenaline from being hit rushing through his brain.  

A few minutes passed, and Liu assumed the soldiers were all asleep

from the silence and snoring.  He breathed a deep sigh of relief.

“Fucking Delmok," the scarred soldier grumbled.

A few hours passed, and Liu awoke.  It was still quite dark out. The

other soldiers seemed to be asleep.  

Liu quietly sneaked outside, being careful not to wake any of the soldiers.  He wanted to get outside to avoid the possibility of another assault.  

He walked around the side of the building where the stables were until he got to his horse. Unlocking the gate carefully, he grabbed the horses’ lead.  

Liu led the horse back to where the barracks aligned with the path, and sat down a few feet in front of it.  The horse lied down next to Liu.  For two hours, Liu sat next to his horse, waiting for Shi An to arrive at sunrise.
