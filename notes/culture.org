**** Verses
***** Neiman
Neiman 1 1:4: He hated no one, not even his enemies!

Neiman 2 14:25 It is what we do over our lifetimes that shows what we are. The Four or the Darkness within. 

Neiman 4 2:8 "/Virtue and Vice cannot be united, neither can Versalist Truth and Wisdom with foreign Deceptions and Foolishness, just as the Four could not be at Peace amongst the Darkness/"

***** Aredal
*Aredal 1 1:24: Being honest when it suits you is easy, it is being honest when it doesn’t that is honourable.* *Even the liar tells the truth in ordinary matters, it is the honest man who reveals his shortcomings.*

*Aredal 1 1:45: To oppose Truth is not just to speak outright lies. Witholding information for the sake of one’s status or reputation, twisting the tongue to use the words of Truth but the essence of Deception, blocking the eyes, ears or mind from Knowledge which reveals Truth, this is all Deception.* 

Aredal 1 8:2: Truth is not just telling no lies when asked-- it is a duty to use one's voice to spread it as far as possible./

Aredal 1 4:8: Be upfront both about what you know and what you do not know.

Aredal 2 4:14 My Compassion will hear all those who hear me.

** Neo-Delmian
- The first Eastern Delmian Emperor Tsuri was a prophet
- They worship the Trinity, like classical Delmians do
- More caste like, less fluidity between roles
- Emperor of Delrei is the religious head
  
** Vareeshi
- Believe that people who participate in their religion and create and join triangles gain access to an after life. The better place your ball achieves, the better your after life is. Based on the highest place of the ball
- Balls are customized to the household and tell the story of the household and their ancestry to an extent 
- Domination based religion
- Taxes tithe upwards towards the top
- Each king has a triangle, inside the triangle are balls which represent the people loyal to their cause. These balls are in order.
- Each king's pyramid has different goals, attitudes, and traits which are seen as noble and ignoble
- Kings have the authority to swap people's order
- There is a monk class that is in-charge of the accounting of everyone's pyramids. The kings pay tax towards maintaining monks. The amount of monk2s you MUST pay for scales with how large your triangle
  
*** King Making Season
- On average, every 6-7 years
- Monks make astral calculations to declare when king making seasons begin and end
- Killing anybody not in your current pyramid is ok during King Making
- When somebody is killed, everyone in their triangle who's number is a multiple of the person killed, are forced to move to the triangle of the person who did the killing, or we they can become a free agent (most people default to moving)
  - Kills only count if the killer is Varreshi themselves
- If you die as a free agent, your killer takes your whole afterlife leaving you with none
  
*** Ball Laws
- Balls are considered a household
  - As a child, you are added to your parents ball
- When of age, children can create a new ball by marrying, or declaring independence
- When the head of household dies, the ball goes to the eldest dependent member, with slight preference given to male dependents
  - If there are no of age dependents, the king appoints an executor until a member comes of age
  - When a child comes of age under an executorship they are forced to make their own ball
  - When all children are of age, the executor swap their ball with the ball of the household they had been overseeing
- You can't free agent back to a pyramid where you've already been. You can be forced to move back
- If someone dies outside of king making, all balls move up one place

** Beisanian
- Worshiped for the return of Aredal 
  
* Language
** Wreathwardian
Proto-Wreathwardian Language spawns a variety of Tribal Wreathwardian Languages, among which some emerge as dominant, but also syncretize with the non-dominant ones, into a smaller amount of languages used by larger tribes or princedom-sized entities, which eventually continue the same process to reach a smaller amount of dominant languages. One of these languages is what might be called "Old Trentanian" today which is used as the scholarly and religious langauge of the Citadel. The main languages used in the Citadel now are, from most to least popular:
1. Trentanian
2. Surkusch
3. Wolstamm
4. Nairfalkish
5. Whenranul
6. Terillie
7. Qlicor (Golzen)
8. Cunasque (Monasque)
9. Otten (Ottencollen)
10. Farsunni

    Of these, Surkusch and Farsunni are the only ones not strongly influenced by Proto-Wreathwardian.
*** Trentanian
Trentanian = English

Sarlanian (Old Trentanian) = Latin (where Rothars, Athers, etc come from, used by Garranis and the native language of the Gods)

Old Old Trentanian = Greek (Where Revictus, Architor, Olitheon come from)
**** Sarlanian
It is similar to english but with some norwegian influences phonetically, though it is actually the father language of English/New Trentanian.

Sarlanian is a simple language on the phonetic and grammar level, but in that simplicity words often become long. They are more predisposed to combining words in a very childish and intuitive way to make new words rather than making new words "from scratch".
*** Alphabet
o: "aw" as "long" or "dawn"
i: "er" as in "biker" or "flounder"
ö: "oh" as in "or"
e: "eh" as in "day"
** Delmian
*** Basics
Delmian seems to use a logography system, but in actuality, it is just an extremely lengthy alphabet, where each what will be deemed "complex letter" is also a word with meaning, and then those "large letters" are actually used in pure ideography, not logography. A complex letter is simply a one-syllable word. The main theory of Sarlanian is to have a list of easily differentiable one-syllable words (do not use sounds that are too difficult to make, or "falling vs rising"/"short vs long"), which must be memorized and also link to symbols (or really, a large alphabet).

Delmian is a language that is designed to be spoken and parsed quickly, but can be a bit cumbersome to write. A Sarlanian word in itself can store a lot of information about its etymology, which is why it has remained as a very popular academic language in the Citadel. The Delmian language is actually very analagous to the use of simple number bases to describe larger numbers, where basic symbols are analagous to 0s and 1s in binary, or 1-10 in decimal.

Here, the common sounds in the Sarlanian language will be discussed using romanized terms.

There are technically 10 vowels, best described phonetically as:
ah
ee or i
eh
ai or eye
oi
oh or o
ow
aw
ew or u
uh

Vowels are always viable in the same places, but consanants are technically divisible into several categories which affect where they can be used in conjunction with other vowels and consanants.

VIABLE IN 1 SPOT ONLY:
Set I: Only-first-alone-viable:
- H
- Y

VIABLE IN 2 SPOTS:
Set II: Not-last-viable-but-first-and-second-viable:
- W

VIABLE IN 3 SPOTS:
Set III: First-and-second-and-last-first viable:
- R
- L

Set IV: First-and-last-first-or-last-second viable (total 13):
- G
- P
- T
- B
- D
- SH/ZH
- K
- M
- F
- V
- N
- J/CH
- TH

Set V: First-and-last-first-and-last-second viable:
- S/Z

For example, with the brackets in vowels, "h(ew)" works but "(ew)h" does not, but "z(ew)" and "(ew)z" do work. "tw(uh)" works but "(uh)w" does not, but "ts(uh)" and "(uh)s" work.

In total, with 19 consanants [I, II, III, IV, V] that be first before a vowel, and 10 vowels, there are 190 two-"letter" words with consanant-before vowel. With 16 [III, IV, V] consanants that can be used after a vowel, and 10 vowels, there are 160 two-"letter" words with consanant-after vowel. Thus, there are 350 two-"letter" words. However, since this is not an alphabetized language, several three-"letter" words, and a small amount of four-"letter" words,  are actually equivalent to this form of two-"letter" words, those being VCC, CVC, CCV, CCVC, CVCC.

Therefore:
For CVC, there are 19 consanants [I, II, III, IV, V] * 10 vowels * 16 [III, IV, V] consanants, or 3040 combinations.
For VCC, there are 10 vowels * (15 last-first [III, IV] * 1 last-second [V]) + (3 last-first [III, V] * 13 last-second [IV] + 2 [V]) consanants, or 560 combinations.
For CCV, there are 19 first [I, II, III, IV, V] * 3 second [II, III] consanants * 10 vowels, or 220 combinations.
For CCVC, there are 19 first [I, II, III, IV, V] * 3 second [II, III] consanants * 10 vowels * 16 last-first [III, IV, V] consanants, or 9120 combinations.
For CVCC, there are 19 consanants [I, II, III, IV, V] * 10 vowels * (15 last-first [III, IV] * 1 last-second [V]) + (3 last-first [III, V] * 13 last-second [IV] + 2 [V]) consanants, or 10640 combinations.

Not every combination is used, and there are many combinations that are barely suitable and thus have no words. For example, "ths" and "ts" are deemed too similar and therefore are treated as one, which is closer to pronounced "ths" when before a vowel and "ts" when after. There are also many words that have a "complex letter" aka monosyllabic version, and an extremely similar multisyllabic version. The CV and VC are not usually use, only for words that will almost definitely begin a sentence, as they can be confused. For example, let's say we have a word that sounds like ahr, from ah + r, and a word "baht" from b + ah + t, and are actually saying both words in succession. It is indistinguishable from another set of words, "bah" (b + ah) and "tahr" (t + ah + r), when said in succession, even though one is two monosyllabic words and another is one dualsyllabic words with a different meaning. This is why the VC and CV formats are usually avoided or always put at the beginning of a sentence. On the flip side, the most commonly used format, especially as a ratio to the actually used combinations over total possible combinations, is by far the CVC and CCV formats. For fluency in the Sarlanian language, almost all of these formats must be learned and serve as the basis of the Sarlanian language.

Sarlanian is a language that is designed to preserve efficiency in both the speaking length as well as preserving their concept of being able to intuit a words meaning from its parts. To do this, Sarlanian words often have a shorter and longer version. However, this is where Sarlanian leaves room to evolve and also where context matters; the shortened versions are technically interchangeable, and sometimes the same shortened version will be used for two different words in two different contexts, they are meant to be derived from the longer version. the shortened version is less often used in writing as it is often just as efficient to write the longer version.



However, even though some sounds are viable they are more uncomfortable to say, and have thus been somewhat avoided, at least using them to combine to create more complex words.
*** Vocabulary
**** VC
**** CVC / CCV
The first consanant in a complex letter is always the most important to determining the influence of its meaning, or more meaningfully, it is almost always the category in which the word is encapsulated, and it is always present.

The "G" consanant is associated with moods, humanity, psychology, mind, personal things, personality, the human experience, subjectivity, and the emotional landscape or anything it touches.
The "P" consanant is associated with society, large group dynamics, politeness, ethics, positive change, and politics.
The "T" consanant is associated with the abstract, intellectual, theoretical, formuliac, and mathematical.
The "B" consanant is associated with wildlife and nature, and the colors green and yellow.
The "D" consanant is associated with orientation, movement, adverbs and measurement.
The "SH/ZH" consanant is associated with the body, health, the sense of touch, and movement, and skin tones.
The "K" consanant is associated with human-made objects and tools, and the color grey.
The "M" consanant is associated with war, opposition, warm colors, and negative change.
The "F" consanant is associated with observation, aesthetics, the sense of sight and the appearance of things.
The "V" consanant is associated with law, order, hierarchy and declaratives.
The "N" consanant is associated with the religious, spiritual, hierarchy, spiritual or magical power, and the hidden, and the colors blue and purple.
The "J/CH" consanant is associated with domestic life, routine, roles, small groups, the sense of touch, and personal relationships.
The "TH" consanant is associated with language itself, archetypes, entertainment, the sense of hearing, and art.

The "R" consanant is associated with movement, and transformation when before the vowel but permanence when after the vowel, and transparency or changing colors. Also associated with verbs.
The "S/Z" consanant is associated with groups, the world, amalgamation, and plurals or a large amount when at the end of a word, and the color white.
The "L" consanant is associated with differences, adjectives and comparisons, or a small amount/singular when at the end of a word.
The "W" consanant is associated with adjectives and opposites, or the lack of something, and the color black.

The "Y" consanant is associated with commerce, trade, and business, and the color gold.
The "H" consanant is associated with the lack of something and the color black (when alone).

| Coin Mole        |      2 | Coin Moles can be assigned to sniff for either gold or silver coins underground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | N/A                              |
| Parrot (P)       |      3 | Parrots are aerial units that can collect information about the state of the battlefield, and report back to the player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | \+: N/A \-: L                    |
| Spear-Man (ST)   |      1 | Stick-Men are bipedal ground units which have a long pointed spear. They are of low intelligence and will attack enemy units on sight, and cannot be instructed.                                                                                                                                                                                      | \+: B, R, DO \-: S, SH, F        |
| Sniper Snake (S) |      5 | The sniper snake is a long-ranged unit that can shoot a powerful stream of venom from its mouth. This venom will instantly kill Stick-Men or other weaker units. The Sniper Snake is quite fast, but also vulnerable.                                                                                                                                 | \+: D, R, ST  \-: SH, DO         |
| Frog (F)         |      3 | The frog is a medium-ranged unit which shoots a small spray of venom in a cone. It can jump high to hit aerial units, or reposition. It has very low health.                                                                                                                                                                                          | \+: SH, D, L \-: R, B, DO        |
| Ravhound (R)     |      4 | Ravhounds are very fast ground units that also have a decent bite. Unlike Stick-Men, Ravhounds can be recalled back to base for further instruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | \+: F, D \-: SH, B, S, DO        |
| Shadowmaker (M)  |      3 | Shadowmakers are the only unit that can protect others from the sun, which slowly kills them. They are of similar speed to Stick-Men, and can be told to follow one unit or a group of units. They cannot attack.                                                                                                                                     |                                  |
| Shield-Man (SH)  |      2 | Shield-Men are bipedal defensive units which have a front-facing defensive shell. They are very effective when leading in front of Stick-Men and Shadowmakers, creating a large, durable force, and their shells are immune to Sniper Snake venom. However, they can be easily toppled by Bulldogs, or flanked by Drophawks.                          | \+: ST, S \-: F, B, D            |
| Bullhog (B)      |      8 | Bullhogs are powerful, quick units that can destroy several units with a single charge. They can be decent tanks, but are also dumb and will leave weaker units unprotected to chase a stronger unit.                                                                                                                                                 | \+: SH, DO \-: S, ST             |
| Drophawk (D)     |      4 | Drophawks are aerial units which can pick up the rocks near the tent with their talons, and drop them onto other units, destroying weaker units including Stick and Shell Men, Shadowmakers, Sniper Snakes and Ravhounds in one hit. However, Drop Hawks are very straight flyers who do not dodge attacks and are easily countered by Sniper Snakes. | \+: DO, SH, ST, B \-: L, R, S, F |
| Leechrows (L)    |      1 | Leechcrows are very dumb and mostly serve to attack Drophawks and put pressure on parrots. They can be killed in one hit by any attacking unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | \+: D, P \-: N/A                 |
| Domesnapper (DO) |      3 | Domesnappers are extremely slow defensive units. They are best when in place, and do lots of damage with their strong jaws. They are very hard to hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                | \+: R, F, S, L \-: ST, DO, B     |
