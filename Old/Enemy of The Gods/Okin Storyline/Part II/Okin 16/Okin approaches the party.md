Okin snuck in between carriages and larger men. It was nerve-racking, being in the centre of hoofs and wheels racketing, but he honestly felt more safe in the shadow of something much larger. Only Olitheon knew who was a member of the cult.

*Maybe this is an exercise in futility,* Okin said. *After all, I’m heading to a party that’s likely going to be full of cult members.* 

He shook the thoughts from his head, and continued to stay unspotted. *The mission* would be futile if he was spotted before he even got there.

He turned on to the street of Aldwin’s manor. It was a busy time of day, but he still spotted a multitude of carriages and horses parked along the side of the road leading up to the property.

*I doubt Previa even knows a quarter of these people,* Okin thought. He scowled; sometimes the political pandering in The Citadel felt a little... Deceptive.

*Well, at least it’ll be easier for me to hide among the crowd.* 

Men stepped down out of the carriages onto the sidewalk. Some of them were followed by Rothars, though there seemed to be relatively little compared to a usual event of this scope.

Okin continued along the main road; he didn’t want to get in the way of an Ather he knew and be forced to engage in conversation, or worse, spotted by someone part of the cult who would report back to Aldwin.

He got to the carriage adjacent to the entrance of Aldwin’s manor. Men entered through the two tall stone pillars that enclosed the bush walls set around the manor. 

Okin feigned a casual stance as he waited for a time where there was little foot traffic. He glanced between the pillars onto the yard.

Okin’s eyes widened, and he crouched down behind the carriage and leaned in to get a better look.

On the yard, talking and holding a drink, he saw *Athers* wearing costumes and masks resembling animals. There were green-painted leather mask with outward pearl spikes resembling a Tarnavin; long wooden masks partnered with mossy scarfs as the mane of a Krinosian Horse, and dark brown capes to represent the hide of a Bortog.

And of course, those very-beaked dark masks that the assassin had worn--- the same one that was tucked into Okin’s Ather’s satchel at this very moment. 

They also had black cloaks over them--- identical to the ones Okin had taken from the assaulter. Like the others, though, they wore Ather’s robes underneath--- though they could only be seen peeking out from below the knees.

Okin crouched down further and scanned the area more carefully. Athers vacant of masks and costumes were still walking into the manor---but they were too focused on their conversations to notice Okin hiding behind the other side of the carriage.

Okin ripped open his satchel. He dug for the cloak and pulled it over his head. 

He struggled and half of it hung from the cliff of his ear, but he was too focused on pulling the beak out from the satchel to care. He scrambled for it and pulled the cloth band over the back of his head until he could see through the dark glass holes in the mask. He shrug up his shoulder and the cloak fell into position.

It was a well-made mask, but the dark glass that almost entirely hid the wearer’s eyes could only be seen through so well. 

Okin stood up from the behind the carriage and dusted off the robe. He waited for a clear opportunity and walked through the stone pillars onto Aldwin’s property.
