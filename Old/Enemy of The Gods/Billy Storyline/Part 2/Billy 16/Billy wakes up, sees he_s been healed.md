“I don’t really care what he thinks, he’s the reason why we’re in this situation in the first place! All he’s done is moan, and grovel, and get drunk, and blame others for the problems he’s caused,” Allia’s voice was muffled.

Billy’s eyelids fluttered. Dark browns blurred into vision.

“Well, no, Billy, never would come here anyway. Maybe Order has similar saying to Versalism: The Four give, The Four take away,” Benjamin chuckled. “Like Billy.”

“I---,” Allia’s throat caught.

Their voices faded out, and the room faded in. It was completely encapsulated in dark woods, homely but not disgusting. Billy squirmed, shoving off the blanket. Even in a closed room, it was frigid up here, but not quite as freezing as the final few days approaching the Monastery.	

He rubbed his side, completely sliding off the blanket. There was still a ragged tear where he had been  burned, as expected, but his skin felt soft and smooth--- well, as much as it had before, at least. He leaned down to get a better look, and sure enough, the skin there was more pristine than much of his arms and legs. There was no sign of any scarring or burning.

The girl. It must’ve been. He scratched at where the burn should’ve been, wincing. She’d used her Heraldry on him while he was unconscious. That burning Light.

He slid off of the hardwood bed. His body shivered, and so he grabbed the blanket and wrapped it around himself. He could hear chatter from the deck just outside the room again.

“Thank you, Allia. Didn’t stay very long, but still learn lots. And sorry. Will do everything we can to help,” Benjamin’s voice echoed underneath the door from outside.

Still shaking, Billy pushed open the door, the blinding blue making him squint. The three turned at the slamming of the cabin door.

“Billy!” Damian shouted, jumping off his barrel and running towards his brother with open arms. He ran awkwardly, still keeping a heavy wool jacket wrapped around him, which was made even worse by the multitude of tendrils entangled around his body. Billy hobbled into a hug, though he couldn’t feel much through the blanket.

“Damian,” Billy pulled away from the embrace, holding Damian’s shoulder. The boy was unharmed. 

“You took a big risk, going with Benjamin to rescue me. You---you shouldn’tve,” Billy glanced to Allia, who stood with crossed arms. “But---you were brave, and I’m proud. That---whatever that was with that fucking ghost thing, it was very impressive.”

Damian smiled, which made Billy do the same. 

“Benjy,” Billy laughed with open arms as he approached his friend. “Once again, though I hate to say it, ya saved me. Guess I... owe you a beer or something Seems.”

“Seems about right price for your life,” Benjamin gave a toothy smile. Billy laughed, clasping a hand around his old friend’s massive back.

“Not just me, though. Damian help plan, and you would be dead if not for her,” Benjamin motioned with his chin to Allia. She still stood with arms crossed, hair whipping in the wind, her lower face shielded by the massive woolen jacket. 

Billy swallowed. Even though he knew he *should* probably thank her, it just didn’t want to come out of his throat. 

Finally, he looked to the wooden floor planks. It’d be a little easier to express his gratitude to them.

“Uh, thanks for uh, healing the burn,” Billy said. She didn’t respond,\[ Insert a beat here of him hesitating?\] she was also probably looking at the ground.

Billy stood on his tiptoes, staring over the ship’s stern, shielding his face as he did so. The sun glared directly above him. That meant they were heading north. He peered up, the sky was a clear blue, just a few wisps of clouds, most above him. 

“Wait,” Billy said. “Why are we going north? There’s nothing north.”

Benjamin sighed. “Due to our actions, Allia is separated from all she knows. The Monastery won’t accept her back unless she returns with something they been searching for a long time.”

“So?” Billy narrowed his eyebrows at Benjamin. “We’re left them. And we’re *never* going back.”

“No,” Benjamin said. “We’re going to help her find what she is looking for.”

“What? I---“ Billy stammered. 

“There is only one place that our members have not thoroughly searched for remnants of the artifacts\[ iceisnice, 2021-08-23 9:25 PM

Decide better name\],” Allia interjected. “Krinosas.”

Billy’s eyes gaped. 

“No, no, no, nonono! Turn this ship around!” Billy stomped over to the edge of the ship, clutching its side and taking a terrifying look down below. There were grey, rocky mountains, tips covered in snow not even that far below them. A massive snowy mountain range---Billy racked his mind for his childhood geography lessons about Wreathward--- shit, that could only mean they were already in Northern Nairfalk!

“Wh---why would we ever go to *Krinosas*?” Billy shouted, waving his hands at Benjamin as if he were throwing an invisible object. “That’s---that’s *worse* than the execution they had in store for us!”

“Nononono. I already went to your crazy flying fucking island,” Billy stomped around, pointing a finger at Allia. “And was almost *killed*. We’re not going to the only place that might be worse. Damian! Tell that cinking thing to turn this ship around!”

Damian’s attention darted  back and forth from Billy to Benjamin, who shook his head.

“Damian! We’re not going on a fucking suicide mission! Turn this thing around!”

“Billy!” Benjamin’s huge hands stopped Billy’s trembling from the shoulders-down. Towering over him, his friend gave him an imposing stare. “Come with me. *Don’t* argue.”

Billy glared up at Benjamin like a toddler vengeful at his parents for punishing him. Finally, he loosened up, and Benjamin must’ve felt it, because he released his grip. 

Billy followed Benjamin back into the cabin where he had slept. Benjamin slammed the door behind them.
