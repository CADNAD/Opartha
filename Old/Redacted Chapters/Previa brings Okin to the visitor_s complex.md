Previa smiled as he led Okin out of the yard, he bounced with a spring in his step.

“I didn’t know you were here, Okin.  These past few weeks have been *quite the bore,*” he said.

Okin raised an eyebrow, frowning. “What *have* you been doing here, anyway?”

“Father wants me to run for Impalias for the central Whenran district, and he says I need to do all this ‘political preparation’, to make sure that the other Athers in the region back me,” Previa replied, rolling his eyes. “ It’s kind of funny, you and I both thought that _maybe I’d_ become a High Ather, and now here I am, running for Impalias.”

Okin’s jaw dropped.  *You?  Run for Impalias? What has gotten into Aldwin? Previa is the last Ather in Whenran who should be elected as an Impalias!*

Previa stopped in his tracks, causing Okin to halt behind.  “You’ll back me, right Okin?” 

Okin’s eyes shot to Previa’s smiling face.  *I-I can’t back you!  You’re my friend, but it just--- it would hurt The Citadel!*

“I--- I don’t know who I’ll back in the election,” Okin said. It *was* the Truth.

Previa turned, continuing to walk, his expression unaffected.

“So, what are *you* doing here, Okin?  What were you discussing with Father?”

*It is so strange how he refers to Aldwin as ‘Father’ even to others. I guess I never noticed it until now.*

“When I was at Metheno, I---,” Okin’s mind replayed Aldwin’s warning just minutes before.  *You will not speak of this to anyone, and you will not spend any of your time following the two criminals.*  Previa made it so difficult to tell the truth, in fact, it was now virtually impossible; he would be lying unless he told Previa the true reason why he came to The Citadel, and he would be lying to Aldwin if he broke the promise. 

*I---I have never been put in a place like this before. I still feel the utter shame of betraying my Dedication to the Truth, but now, no matter which path I take, I will betray it again. Strangely enough, it seems of all people, Gendro is right again. There are some times where one cannot avoid lying, where he does not have any other option.*

Previa’s keen eyes looked for a response from Okin, and the High Ather finally responded.

“I merely came to strengthen my Dedication, with your father’s approval. Unfortunately, he declined,” Okin said.

Previa frowned. “Only father would get in the way of someone else’s goals like that.”

*Get in the way?  Your father is giving you a free ticket to become an Impalias!* Okin thought, shaking his head. 

“It is I who needs to step up if I wish to further my Dedication,” he said.

Reaching the outer ring of the city, Previa led Okin down a smaller street, stopping at a larger wooden complex.

“Here we are, your Rothar should be in here,” Previa said. “What was his name again?”  

“Gendro,” Okin replied, as the two Athers entered the building.  The hall was narrow, floored with light brown carpet, several rooms on each side and a staircase leading up at the end.  In the centre of the hall stood a petite woman in a black tunic and headdress, the common wear of an Istar.  She was holding an old broom in her hands, sweeping the hall.

Previa raised his hand, getting the woman’s attention.

“Have you possibly seen a Rothar Gendro enter the visiting complex recently?” He asked.

“Oh yes,” the woman replied.  “He is in the last room, on the left,” she said, pointing.  Previa smiled a thank-you, and he and Okin walked to the door at the end of the hall.

Okin knocked, but there was no response.  Leaning his ear to the door, he thought he heard nothing, but no, there was a strange sound.  He listened closer, and there was a deep droning--- Gendro was asleep, and snoring.  

Okin grabbed the doorknob and turned it open.

*Actually, I should probably let him rest. I was the one who brought him all this way, and now it seems for nothing.*

Okin quietly pulled the door shut again.

“What’re you doing?” Previa asked.

“Gendro’s sleeping.  I rather not disturb him.”

“Ah,” the young Ather replied.  “You must be quite tired yourself,  it’s a while from Metheno.”

“Not so much. But I am a little hungry, I’ll admit,” Okin smiled.

“I can take you down to the market,” Previa said. 

“That would be nice,” Okin replied.  “Didn’t your father want you back as soon as possible, though?” 

“He can wait,” Previa chuckled.
