#+title: Wreathward Language History
Proto-Wreathwardian Language spawns a variety of Tribal Wreathwardian Languages, among which some emerge as dominant, but also syncretize with the non-dominant ones, into a smaller amount of languages used by larger tribes or princedom-sized entities, which eventually continue the same process to reach a smaller amount of dominant languages. One of these languages is what might be called "Old Trentanian" today which is used as the scholarly and religious langauge of the Citadel. The main languages used in the Citadel now are, from most to least popular:
1. Trentanian
2. Surkusch
3. Wolstamm
4. Nairfalkish
5. Whenranul
6. Terillie
7. Qlicor (Golzen)
8. Cunasque (Monasque)
9. Otten (Ottencollen)
10. Farsunni

    Of these, Surkusch and Farsunni are the only ones not strongly influenced by Proto-Wreathwardian.
