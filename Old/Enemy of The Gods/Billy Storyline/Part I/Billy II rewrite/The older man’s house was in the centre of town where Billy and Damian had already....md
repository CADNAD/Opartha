The older man’s house was in the centre of town where Billy and Damian had already past; the place where Billy spent most of his childhood. It was one of those rustic, cobblestone buildings. Unlike the others, moss covered the roof and windows. 

“I mean not to intrude on your life, Mr. Cantas, but if I were you I would spend more time on my possessions than that of this... Lionos!” Billy jested.

“Ah, I don’t like to spend much time here, anyway,” the older man, Mr. Cantas held open the door for Billy and Damian.

The inside of Mr. Cantas’ hovel was much more humid, and it smelled of charcoal. It was also rather empty. The furnishings were limited to a wooden shelf containing raw vegetables and grains, a cast-iron stove, two chairs and a table occupied one side, and pots, pans, tools and buckets were scattered across the stone brick floor. The other side of the room had an iron-framed bed with no sheets or pillows, and a staircase leading upwards to a second floor. On top of the food shelf were two unopened bottles, probably whiskey.

“Take a seat. I’ll make you both some tea," Mr. Cantas said, and Billy and Damian sat across from each other at the table. Opening a cabinet below, the man grabbed a stone teapot and began filling it with water from a large wooden bucket.

“Uhm, actually," Billy spoke up, grabbing the attention of the host. “Could I perhaps get some whiskey, or gin, or any sort of spirit?”

The stout man furrowed an eyebrow. “Quite unusual for an uninvited guest to ask for liquor," he said. Damian shook his head, glaring at Billy. The whole walk here, Damian had been giving Billy concerned faces, but they just made Billy want to laugh.

“Yes, I know. I apologize,” Billy said. His eyes locked with Damian’s, and he put his hands on his knees below the table. “It’s just... I have some dark memories when it comes to Metheno, and that’s the only thing that can numb my mind enough.”

“Mhm," Mr. Cantas scratched his chin, eyeing Billy. “Well, Intillia teaches that one should always attempt to ease a man’s pain when the means to do so are readily available.” 

Standing on his tiptoes, the man reached up to grab one of the bottles from the shelf. Indeed, it was whiskey. 

*Maybe I can finally thank those damn Gods for something*, Billy thought.

“Would you like anything, my friend?” The old man asked Damian as he opened the bottle with a corkscrew. 

Damian shook his head. “No thank you, sir.” The old man walked to the table with a glass in one hand and the bottle in the other. Placing down the glass, he poured out the whiskey into it, but his hand began to shake, and some spilt on the table.

“I’m sorry," the old man said, wiping the table with his sleeve. Through furry eyebrows, he examined Billy’s face and wear. “It’s my age, you know.”

The man continued to pour, this time with both hands, until the cup was around three-quarters full.

“Thank you, sir," Billy said, smiling to the man. He slid his right hand out from under the table and grabbed the cup of whiskey, chugging it all down in one gulp and slamming the glass back down on the table with a satisfied sigh. 

“I’m sorry, I never got your name," the old man said.

“You can call me, uh, Saul. And this here is--- Meryl,” Billy replied, gesturing to Damian.

“Hm. And--- what might you be doing here in Metheno?” Mr. Cantas asked.

“Nothing out of the ordinary. Just smoothing the process of another trade route between here and Apathasaw,” Billy chuckled.

Billy hid his hands back under the table. Damian’s expression screamed that the boy wanted to leave, but Billy purposefully shoved that fact to the side.

He peered back up to the old man. “Could I get another drink?” he asked.

“Of course,” Mr. Cantas said, grabbing the bottle from the counter and pouring him another glass. His eyes drew away from Billy’s as he carefully poured with both hands to counteract their shaking. 

Damian eyed Billy from across the table, his pupils motioning for the door. This time, Billy couldn’t help but cringe and feel a little guilty, but he would appear natural and finish his drink before leaving.

“How’s--- you have any kids?” Billy asked the old man as he poured.

The old man nodded. “Yeah, just one. A boy, about your age. Maybe a bit older.”

Billy looked around the room. “Where’s the wife?”

The old man craned his neck downwards. “She passed a few years ago. Only a single man could make a household look like this," he chuckled.

Billy bit his lip. He quickly released it and laughed, “You should see what two men can do.” He downed the second glass, and finished with a great sigh.

“Ah," Billy eyed the bottle in the man’s hand. “Could I, maybe---“

“Just have the rest," the man said, slamming the bottle down onto the table. Though he had been cordial, there was a hint of annoyance in his voice, which obviously irked Damian’s nerves. The boy got up from his seat, going around the table and urging Billy up.

“We should really be going now, wouldn’t want to overstay our welcome," Damian said, smiling to the old man.

“It’s no trouble. I got an extra bed upstairs and a spare bedroll if you’d like to stay the night," the man replied.

Billy smiled. “That sounds---“

“Thank you, but we need to be on our way," Damian spoke up, pushing Billy away from the table.

Billy reached forward to grab the bottle from the table, and his golden watch showed itself from underneath his sleeve as he stretched out his arm, just barely grabbing it. Mr. Cantas squinted at Billy’s shimmering wrist as Damian guided him out of the house, slamming the door shut on the old man.
