Okin tells Aldwin about meeting Billy, Aldwin tells Okin that he’ll deal with it and that everything will be fine. Okin tells Aldwin about how Billy accused Synodontis of killing his father, and Aldwin dismisses the claim. Okin goes looking for more information at the records, and Backuh tells Okin that Aldwin is lying to him; he gives him one page of the fourth book of Nexon and then Okin asks Previa to ask Aldwin if it is real and Aldwin confirms its existence, Backuh tells Okin that there are more hidden texts of The Citadel, Okin then starts to confront Aldwin directly about the hidden texts of The Citadel. Okin gets the idea to research non-religious texts from Previa’s books so he goes to the library to get non-religious texts to corroborate the events from the Fourth Book, and links the use of a golden weapon to a mysterious natural disaster/creation/abnormality that is unsolved by the world. Okin goes to try to print out the passage of the Fourth Book with the damning historical confirmation but his printing job is sabotaged by the owner of the printing presses who is part of the cult. 

The cult tries to capture/kill Okin, but Deionis saves him. Okin then lives in Deionis’ bunker who reveals to him that he used to be a Ather. Okin realizes that Aldwin wore the same rings that the cult assassins had on their fingers, and then he sneaks into Aldwin’s house (masquerade ball) and talks to Previa who tells him where the cult meeting is taking place, Okin sneaks in masked and gets the Space Crystal. 



  
Okin uses Previa to get information to further his goals, then at the end finds out that he needs to stop Previa from getting elected and uses the information Previa got him to do so, Previa feels betrayed

Okin is honest with Gendro at the start, Gendro meets Backuh and is adamantly against Backuh’s plan for him and Okin to break into (aldwin’s house/the cathedral/the seat/final location) to get the secret texts and release them to the public. Okin agrees with Gendro and promises he won’t, but after discovering the cult he goes behind Gendro’s back and steals texts with Backuh. Gendro (possibly turns himself in or snitches) and Okin get caught and arrested for stealing Citadel property and meddling with the election.

  
  
  
Okin meets Backuh while at the Citadel records building while searching for information about Billy’s accusation of Synodontis: he looks for Synodontis’ travel logs for the date of Billy’s dad’s murder. There are none, but there are travel logs of a day before and a day after--- at the two towns right before and after Metheno on the road.

Okin tells Backuh he is pursuing Billy and his accusation, and he doesn’t know what the truth is. Backuh gives Okin one of the journal’s of the Gods, purporting it to be part of the Versalist Bible. Okin tells Backuh that he won’t be able to continue because Aldwin is making him go back to Ariska, but Backuh argues finding the truth is more important than following Aldwin’s orders.

Okin seeks out the Arbiter of Truth for advice, telling him that he believes Aldwin is keeping something from him. The AoT reminds him about the importance of staying upfront and honest and trying your best, and says that if he is honest to Aldwin Aldwin will return the honesty; so Okin tries to convince Aldwin one more time to let him stay by being honest and convincing as was displayed in the story about Olitheon and Nexon convincing the rest of the Gods to side with Aredal, but Aldwin firmly says no. Okin also questions Aldwin about the decision to have Previa run for Impalias, which Aldwin also shuts down. (Aldwin tells Okin that pursuing the mystery of Billy and the Synodontis will piss off powerful people and lead to Okin’s destruction and he won’t allow it.) Okin realizes that to pursue the Truth of what happened to Billy and have true Justice he will have to go behind Aldwin’s back and lie to him, which he sees as an unworthy Sacrifice. After leaving Aldwin’s home, he encounters the Arbiter of Bravery on the street who emasculates him somewhat.

The next day Okin sees a DH execution, and when he returns home, he is met by Previa who confirms the existence of the Fourth Book of Nexon.   

Okin goes back to Backuh to return the page of the book, and Backuh tells Okin that the investigation is crucial and the reason Aldwin wants him gone is because Aldwin is hiding the true texts of the Citadel, which include the book he gave Okin. Backuh encourages him to seek out Trenton to veto Aldwin’s decision so he can stay. 


Assasins come after Okin, Gendro saves Okin. Okin tells Gendro about why the cultists might be after them, so Gendro helps Okin and himself hide in a Rothar training bunker. Okin goes back to Backuh and says that they were attacked and brings Gendro. Backuh tells 

The cult needs to take control of 3 other Impaliases so they can have a majority to vote fore re-igniting the war with Farsun. Previa with the guidance of his father joins the cult, and Okin reunites with his friend in secret to
