Okin knocked on the old wooden door.

He heard ruffled footsteps inside. “Coming,” a voice shouted from inside.

Okin’s father pulled open the door, a delayed smile coming across his face.

“Okin,” a couple seconds later, his father’s smile morphed into a frown. “Aren’t you supposed to be preparing for the next part of the trial?”

Okin shook his head, but then stopped, bitting his lip.

He would be disappointed to find out that William’s killers, a Dark Herald, had escaped. Okin cringed at the thought of his fathers reaction to the news. But of course, he would not lie.

Okin lowered his head, eyes away from his father. “They escaped, father. Billy and Damian somehow escaped last night.”

The old man scoffed. “Those are two slippery bastards,” he said, sighing. “But, Aredal’s Justice will catch up with them sooner or later.”

Okin nodded. “Perhaps I am yet to be his servant in that undertaking. I am riding for The Citadel today, to alert Impalias Aldwin of their guilt and escape. I--- I came to say goodbye, father.”

The short man looked up, smiling. “Goodbye, Okin.” He lifted his hand to wipe under his left eye. “Your visit has reminded me how proud I am to have a son like you.”

Okin looked down, returning a soft smile. “My father taught me well.”

Okin’s dad chuckled. “Well then. Go catch those bastards.”
