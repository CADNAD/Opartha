*The fifth bullet* slid into the chamber, and the cylinder closed into the centre of the revolver with a click.  Crouching down on the beige, grassy hill, a man with a black cowboy hat inspected his firearm.  He brushed aside his dark brown denim jacket, and holstered the revolver on his right hip. 

His dark blue eyes stared down at his left wrist, where a pristine golden watch sat in contrast to his rugged wear.  

“I’m coming to see you.  I shouldn’t have taken so long, I should have been there sooner, but I’m finally coming to see you.”  

Horse-drawn carriages passed over the surrounding dunes, where the tip of the sun stretched above the horizon. The man stood up, then brushed the dust off his black jeans.  

He looked down from his small hill.  “You ready to go?”  he shouted towards the flattened valley at the back of a thin man who was seated on top of a thin fur blanket.  The figure turned his thin head, brushing away his wavy, unkept black hair and stared at him with round, dark eyes. He didn’t look any older than a teenager.

“Yeah, I guess so," the thinner, younger man replied, putting on torn, dusted boots before standing up.  Leaning down, he folded the blanket in half and then rolled it up so he could carry it under his shoulder.  The young man waited at the bottom of the hill for the man with a cowboy hat to join him.

The two found themselves at a thin tree with two horses hitched to it, alongside a small gravel road.  A pitch-black horse lay resting on the ground, and a smaller white one with brown spots stood grazing.  

“Get up!” The man with the cowboy hat shouted as he approached the lying horse.  Grunting, the horse hoisted itself up with the assistance of the man.  “Good girl.”

The two men got on their horses and trotted left onto the gravel road. They whipped the reins and the horses kicked up dust, galloping off.

For almost an hour, they traveled on the gravel road, passing a few other riders and carriages along the way.  There wasn’t much out here in terms of development or housing, as the land was not fertile and quite hilly,  but they did pass a large steel factory, decorated with little silhouettes, probably guards and horses.  It was most likely an ore processing plant, judging by how much smoke rose from the wide funnels on top, and the singular railroad connecting to the plant, which sat large mineral-carrying cars.

On the road in front of him, the man with the cowboy hat could see two figures standing in front of the gravel road.  They galloped closer, and the figures spun around, dark jackets flapping in the wind. They stomped forward with blackened boots loaded with spinning spurs.

The one on the left held out his hand, and the two riders came to a halt, the horses skidding to a stop a couple meters away from the two men dressed in black.

“Got a toll card?”  The man on the left asked the rider with the cowboy hat, as the two men circled the riders, carefully inspecting the horses.

The man with the cowboy hat gestured to the hilly plains as he made his reply, “No, we’re just riding ‘long the plains here and it got too hilly, ’n the road ended up intersecting with our path.”

The two men dressed in black reconvened at the centre of the road, each made a slight nod at each other, and then turned to the two riders.  The one on the left, a portly man with a grey moustache, said, “C’mon now, this company property, gotta pay toll to use these roads.”  

The man in the cowboy hat rose his voice.  “*I said*, we were just riding along these plains here and it got too hilly, and the road ended up intersecting with our *path!*”  

Faster than the blink of an eye, the man with the cowboy hat reached for his waist, hit the hammer and drew his gun, pointing it at the portly man.  Time came to a halt, and in the corner of his eye, the other company guard raised his gun in slow motion toward the teenager.

With the flick of the wrist and the pull of the trigger, a bullet ripped through the chest of the guard.  Dropping his repeater at his feet, the man fell backwards onto the ground.  

Turning his head to his fallen partner, the portly man’s mouth hung open in shock.  The thin rider’s eyes also widened at the guard lying on the ground, bleeding out.

“Ride!”  The man with the cowboy hat shouted as he slapped the reins. Breaking from his momentary shock, the younger man regained attention and drove his horse forward.  Jumping out of the way, the portly man narrowly avoided being crushed by the thundering legs of the galloping horses.  Breathing heavily, he scrambled for his gun after he had caught his breath.  He aimed the repeater at the head of the man with the cowboy hat, who was already over a hundred yards away, and pulled the trigger.  

The shot had missed, and the man cursed himself as he reloaded his gun.  But by the time he had done so, the two riders were already too far away.

After the portly man was out of sight from the rider’s rearview, they slowed their horses to a trot.  

“Why’d you shoot him, Billy?  You didn’t have to shoot him,” the younger man said.

The man with the cowboy hat turned to look into the dark, innocent eyes of the teen.  “He was gonna shoot us.”

“You coulda shot his arm, or somethin," the younger man replied.

Billy scowled, and then pointed a finger towards his partner.  “Listen, Damian, you don’t complain ‘bout the way things’re done, when you’re too pussy to do anything yourself.  You could get us outta these situations, but ya chose not to, so then it’s in my hands.”  Billy lightly slapped the reins, and his horse jogged off.

Damian let out a strong exhale as he shook his head violently.  He slapped the reins, and his horse followed Billy’s on the road westward.
