The group turned down the tunnel, where the torches were still on the wall. Two men were knocked out on the floor, holding several dun ones in their arms. Beside Avador ran the two muscular hounds, and Damian’s little bunny somehow kept up.

“Where are we going?” Billy shouted. 

“To the way line\[ probably change name lol\] !  That’s the only way you can get to the back of the beast where the ships are fast enough without being stopped,” Avador shouted back.

They kept running through the tunnel, sounds of clattering and commotion echoing behind them. Billy didn’t dare look back. Avador led them up through several narrow stone staircases, which looked to be utility hallways of some kind.

Finally, they reached the open area of the mountain, the familiar double doors where they had confronted Taedon on side, and the array of strange glossy white platforms pointed to the two ends of the beast on the other.  

“Look calm,” Avador said. Both he and Damian had snuffed out their summons some time ago with a snap of the fingers. 

Avador approached the platforms, the rest of them trailing behind. He examined the side bars of a few; Billy noticed some strange characters engraved in the side. 

“This one,” Avador said, stepping in. “Get in, quick.”

Billy and the others squirmed into the circular carrier. Avador reached a hand out, stopping Benjamin. 

“You’re going to have to pilot this thing. You see that?” Avador pointed down to a large, dark crystal in the centre of the disc.

“Focus on it, and focus on pulling us toward Einwa, you will feel the tug of its crystal. Do not ever stop focusing on the two crystals.”

Benjamin nodded, hopping into the seat closest to the gaping aperture. He hovered one hand above the crystal, and then reached out to the mountains in the distance.

The platform rose, and the guards in front of the door muttered to each other. The two advanced toward the group.

“Hurry, go!” Avador shouted. Billy cringed, slinking down into his seat. The guards sped up their advancing, yelling.

The platform shot off towards the mountains.

“Wooooo!!” Benjmain shouted.

“Focus!” Avador shouted, his hair whipping in the wind, further covering his already helmeted face. The elder man frantically scooted over, pushing Damian aside a little. He shielded his eyes and looked back to where they had came from.

Still squeezing the handrails, Billy forced open an eye.  Out of the large crevice in the mountain, he could see the fading image of the lot of circular platforms, and a group of men standing at the edge of the gap.

“They’re trying to follow us!” Avador shouted. He turned back to the rest of the group, kneeling closer. “I may have to leave you to keep my identity a secret. I am sorry. Once you make it to Einwa, run. There will be a load of ships where you arrived, and possibly some closer. Take them and leave!”

They zipped through another mountain, its contents a bunch of colourful blurs. Billy didn’t dare to look back at their pursuers. 

“Duck!” Avador yelled, and the lot, beside Benjamin, buried their heads under the sides of the platform. A streak of fire flew right over Allia and Damian’s hair.

Billy glanced toward their destination. They were approaching Einwa, but the other caravan was on their tail.

“Give me some room,” Avador said. “I must leave you now, and perhaps I can divert some of them in the process.”

Damian gave a respectful nod, unlike anything Billy had ever seen from the boy. Avador flicked both hands in an upward motion, and on the sides of the platform, in Damian’s and Billy’s shadow, two large hawk-like creatures now clutched their feet to the side rails, the familiar purple mist steaming off into the wind.

“Goodbye,” Avador said, holding out his arms in a T. “I hope one day---we will meet again, Damian.”

Damian smiled, bowing his neck. “Thank you, Dakung Avador.”

The two birds flew over, each seizing one arm with their talons, and Avador returned a soft smile.\[ Kinda goofy\]

“Slow the pull, Benjamin!” Avador shouted.

Avador scooted up onto onto the railing of the platform, and kicked himself off. 

The armoured man, carried by his two false wings, descended onto the red terrain below, fading away as they drew into the port of Einwa.

The platform came to a halt inside the terminal, and Billy glanced back. The enemy was approaching on their own platform, they would be upon them in a matter of seconds. 

They found the exit into the large, descending spiral staircase they had travelled up when first arriving and rushed down it. 

“A summoner! He escaped down onto the ground below!” Their pursuers’ voices echoed from above. “I’ll chase after him, you head after the others!”

Billy hurried the group down the stairs, passing several of the brighter openings that led to connecting walkways and open floors of their own. With Avador gone, he would have to take charge. Once again, he and his brother’s survival was in his hands. He would not let them have it.

The stomps of their pursuers rumbled above.

“Here!” Benjamin yelled from bellow. “This the one!” 

The four scrambled out of the closed spiral staircase into the light. Further up the wide, stone walkway was the secret entrance that Avador had led them through when they had arrived.

“Go, go, go!” Billy shouted. The pounding drew closer.

Benjamin charged up to the wall, shuffling his hands over it, trying to find the depression that Avador had found earlier. Allia and Billy turned their backs to the wall, readying for the attackers to come charging out the staircase. The girl’s eyes glowed that too-brilliant aura, and Billy shook.

Billy reached his hand to his side, finally realizing he had no weapon. He stood in a fighting stance with raised fists, feeling as awkward as Damian looked; the lad was straight-backed and shivering, fearful eyes directed at the dark stairwell.

“Hurry, Benjamin!” 

The attackers piled out onto the bridge, three men in the navy guards’ robes. Meeting Allia and Billy’s eyes, they didn’t attack immediately, but all raised hostile hands towards the escapees.

“We know who you are! Surrender or we *will* be forced to attack!” The leader of the guards said, pointing the end of his long-spear at the party. The other two crouched around him, one holding a flaming lantern and the other merely only a shield.

“Come on, come on, come on,” Damian muttered to himself to Billy’s side. The boy’s bony fingers vibrated like lightning. Damian flinched, raising his hands as to let out one of those strange, ethereal attacks, but nothing happened. 

The enemy soldiers took a step forward, and Billy slowed Time. They were advancing with steady, wide stances; one could only be too reckless fighting on a thin walkway against a team of enemy Heralds, especially those who were trying to escape at all costs.

There was another brilliant flash in Allia’s eye, like that of a glass scope reflecting against sunlight. The deathly glow stepped out from within her chest, trickling through the veins in her arms, as she raised them ever-so-slowly. 

She didn’t move, she didn’t pounce, but the Light flashed within Billy’s mind. His eyes burst in terror, the terror of his father. 

Billy jumped out and threw his arm in front of Allia’s sight. 

“No! Stop!!!!” He screamed, his throat ripping.

The light in her veins retreated within, and her eyes faded back to a\[ insert Allia’s eye colour\] 

“They’re not surrendering! Take them!” 

Billy tried to slow it, but he didn’t have much Time. The guard with the lantern shaped his mouth into the O, and from the steel cage shot a wrath of flames. Screaming, Billy threw his body in front of Damian, knocking the lad backwards.

The fiery tongues crisped through his shirt and kissed his side, and his furious exhale turned into a wretch of pain.

With that, the crash of the doors opening shook the bridge.

“Go, go!” Benjamin shouted, waving Damian through the now open doors. Billy was on the ground, chomping down onto his cheek as if that would ease the pain. The stone pathway cracked under the control of the man with the shield. A Solid Herald, then.

“Close your eyes!” Allia shouted, her eyes glowing golden again. Instead of just the veins, her entire forearms seemed to radiate. Crawling belly-down on the ground, Billy tucked his face into his arms. 

Some of the light still leaked in from the gap in his elbow, and it was blinding. There was crashing and shouting around him, and thunderous footsteps shook his body.

He was yanked upwards, but he didn’t have the energy to struggle. Thankfully, he had only ever seen one set of arms so black and bulky. He didn’t slow Time, but it appeared as such; perhaps his subconscious had instinctively done it, or perhaps it was merely an illusion. His side ached, and it felt as if a hot knife was poked into with Benjy’s every step.

“Go!” Allia’s abundance of hair was a dark blur in the corner of Billy’s eye.

Benjamin whipped around, jerking Billy’s body. The stone doors to the mountain crashed together, a shaky boom coming from within an instant later.
