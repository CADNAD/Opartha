Time Heralds accumulate Zeltics by the natural passing of them spending time at the fixed pace in the central timeline. There is a fixed rate at which one accumulates Zeltics, though Control Heralds can also adjust their perception of Time in a positive direction and accumulate Zeltics more quickly, though it is overall less efficient (Zeltics/sec), then accumulating naturally due to the initial Zeltic cost of changing Time Perception. 

Control Heralds can spend Zeltics to slow down time, which has an initial cost. The more they slow down time, the higher the cost. 

Performing movements displaces yourself in the timeline, which is where the majority cost of Zeltics comes in. The Zeltic cost of actions is multiplied inversely by the speed at which the Control Herald has set. 

There is also an effective ticking cost as it is impossible to truly stop moving. Control Heralds often practice meditation while using Time Slow to get the least possible movement and therefore spend the least amount of Zeltics.

If a Control Herald runs out of Zeltics while using Time Slow, their consciousness will be completely displaced from the timeline and they will die.

Speed Heralds can store up power using Zeltics to simulate the passing of Time in an instant without actually physically experiencing that Time. This allows them to generate and release more energy than what is usually physically possible.
