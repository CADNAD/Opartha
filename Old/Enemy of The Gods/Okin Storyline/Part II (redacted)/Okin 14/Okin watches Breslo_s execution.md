Okin stepped out into the street, which was much busier than usual. Flocks of people were chatting as they walked, most of the groups heading eastward. 

A young teen wearing dirty overalls ran past Okin, bumping into him. Okin stumbled backwards in surprise, and the boy said, “Sorry sir!” Before hastily continuing his path forward.

Okin watched the boy continue on his way. He stopped in front of a small family, who were walking in a line, holding hands. 

“Come on, come on! It’s this way!” The boy jumped up and down, waving the group to the East.

Okin trailed the boy’s family; he had to head eastwards to meet the beggar again, but he didn’t like seeing him during busier hours, especially after he’d been attacked. Still, if he couldn’t meet him at this time, Okin was still curious where all these people were heading.

The streets became more and more packed the closer to the marketplace they got. Soon, Okin had lost the family in the sea of heads, his shoulders rubbing against other’s as they all tried to peek up or inch closer to see something in the centre.

Okin shivered. This was the same place where he had seen the servant of Tregale executed a few weeks ago.  He continued to move closer into the crowd. There were guards atop the same wooden platform again, making his stomach sink.

*Another execution? How many demons lie within our own walls?*

Okin stood on his tiptoes, trying to get a good view of who was top the stage, but his vision was constantly obstructed by the moving horde of people. A bright glare flickered off of a gold surface, and the tumultuous crowd settled down. 

The radiance was coming from the sharp golden accents on a white robe, denoting a high-ranking servant of Aredal.

Aldwin.

Okin ducked behind the waving arms of those in front of him. He may not have been wearing his robes, but Aldwin would still recognize his face.

Two Devinars stood at the Impalias’ side, their long spears pointing straight up from the wooden platform. 

*“*People of The Citadel! People of Versalism! People of *The Gods!* It is with a heavy heart that I am here today, but we must be willing to stand for our values, *especially* if they are being betrayed from within. Tregale himself tried to trick our benevolent Gods by pretending to just like them, and betrayed the very balance of our universe in an attempt to usurp power. Those who try to latch on to what we have and corrupt it are the most nefarious of villains,” Aldwin shook his head pitifully, the masses staying attentive to his speech. “They will try to latch on to your emotions, to take advantage of your good nature, to do anything they can to destroy all that you have built! But today, we have defeated one of these diabolical monsters. There are still others out there, but *we* will find them, and Justice will be served!”

From behind the podium, two Rothars stepped up, each locking an arm around a man with a black hood that covered his entire face. He was tied up entirely with multiple ropes, and was limp and motionless.

The Rothars threw the damned on the stage with a thump. The cowl remained on his head.

Okin shrivelled lower into the crowd, peering down as they cheered at Aldwin’s brilliance.

“There is only damnation for the puppets of Deionis and Tregale, those who choose to sneak in the shadows, to steal in the night, to hide amongst the masses!” 

The Rothars stepped back, reaching their hands outwards towards the immobile figure on the floor. As their arms raised, he began to levitate in the air, and finally, he began to squirm.

They continued to lift him higher with no hands or strings attached, his black mask facing forward and toward the jeering mob.

“People of The Citadel! None are above the law! None are above the *Sacrifice* that the Gods made for us, that they *continue* to make for us!” 

The criminal continued to rise, his squirming intensifying. If he was screaming, it was drowned out by the growing bellow of the crowd.

“No being, no matter how dark, how twisted, can pervert that pure Sacrifice!”

The Devinars stepped backwards in unison, and one ripped off the black hood.

Okin jumped up from his low squat as his gaze crossed the face of the damned.

In a moment, Breslo’s eyes enflamed and died as two spears crossed through his neck.

The Ather’s feet swung back and forth underneath the equilibrium of the two spears as the Devinars held up his limp body valiantly.
