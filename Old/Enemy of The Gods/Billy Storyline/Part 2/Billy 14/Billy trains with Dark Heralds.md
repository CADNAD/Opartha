“Take out the wildest ones first! Let them distract each other! Go, Billy, Go!”

Billy rolled underneath the wall of smoky tendrils. The bat-like creature’s head jerked to his new position, making a slurping inhale. 

A bullet ripped through it’s left wing, sending the hand-sized creature to oblivion.

But the airy hissing didn’t stop. Billy spun around, revolver in hand, knowing that another of the creatures were readying up an armageddon.

He didn’t expect three, though. The summoners had ramped up. He’d have to spend some Time.

He was used to flicking his wrist, fast. He barely even had to release Time, the flow waving\[ Weird Verb. Makes it confusing\] on and off in three rapid motions. Not a tendril flew out as the three flying creatures disintegrated into violet dust.

The speedy six-legged arachnids were becoming a problem, though. It wasn’t worth spending the one remaining bullet in the chamber on those anymore. Reloading wasn’t a luxury he could afford. The faceless, flat-bodied, baby-sized beasts surrounded Billy. Their legs created a rapid, unsettling rapping against the wooden floor.

He slowed Time, preparing to dropkick one that ran just in front of his leg. No, it would be better if he could get two in one sweep, otherwise there’d be a great risk of one clamping his leg when he kicked. He prepared a slide to the side, away from the nearest one and towards the farthest one, and released Time.

The nearest one stopped in its tracks, retracing him. Now they were all lined up in a perfect angle. He didn’t even have to slow time to hit them all away with a sweep kick. The first two disappeared into ash, but the one only hit by the end of the kick was only knocked to the side, and limped back up with two broken legs. He crushed it with a stomp.

Billy reached into his pocket, rustling around for the bullets.

“Good, that’s enough,” Beryl said, stepping into the arena and motioning for the Dark Heralds to stop their summoning. “A Control Herald’s speciality is avoiding and redirecting attacks, and his worst enemy is being surrounded. We’ll have to practice this more, but there is something else I have planned for today.”

“Are you ready, my Dakung?” A newcomer ducked in between the curtained  entrance, bowing to Beryl, showing the weapon on his back. Billy’s eyes widened, he didn’t know the exact model, but it was a bolt-action, rare even in Apathasaw. Finishing his bow, Jerel gave his characteristic over-the-top smile to Billy.

“Yes,” Beryl said, shooing other robed apprentices who were filing into the room. “Don’t come in, we’re leaving. It’s time for a hunt.”
