“---we must stick to our roots. It is crucial that we unite The Citadel, and stay together as one Versalist people. We must have experienced leaders, because experience grants Wisdom, and Wisdom is what grants the ability to lead.”

The short, old man smiled at the cheering audience. He waved to some of the other Athers in the pew, most of them roughly his age.  He lifted his white and purple robe as he stepped down from the crossing.

Okin could barely see the procession with the giant visor blocking much of his vision. Still, the comfort of being practically unidentifiable more than counteracted the bulk of the heavy steel armour.

The clergymen in the front fled their pews to crowd around the speaker, blocking him from Okin’s line of sight from the back of the church. 

*Now is a good time to approach.*

Okin stomped forward, his efforts to avoid attention futile in such heavy boots. But most of the Athers that were leaving down the aisle or approaching the speaker gave him one quick look and then redirected their attention. An armoured Rothar was nothing to gawk at in The Citadel.

He excused himself through a couple Athers, and then placed himself in a pew that was just behind where the growing group was gathering, giving him a view of the speaker’s back, but more importantly, placing him within listening range.

“High Ather Arten! High Ather Arten!” A younger Ather, at least compared to the others around him, approached the speaker. 

“Yes, my friend?” The speaker, Arten, responded.

“What are your opinions on the Arbiter of Knowledge?” 

“Arbiter Kolam? He is an extremely well-read man and a fine Arbiter. There is not really anything else to say about the matter,” Arten replied.

The group of surrounding Athers nodded. 

“What about Farsun? That is much more controversial, and worrisome,” an older Ather with a flabby chin said, and the group turned to Arten for a response.

“While Farsun has shown some dissidence in the past, I do not believe we should return to conflict. They are part of The Citadel, like us, and fighting our allies will destroy us.”

The older Athers nodded again. 

“But what about those Easterners? Why are we spending so much resources over there when they haven’t shown a hint of Dedication?” One of the elder Athers asked.

“And---and do you believe that the Synodontis is a true God?”

The group’s eyes focused on Arten, who glanced around rapidly, swallowing before making his answer.

“I do not. I believe what has been taught by The Citadel since its inception; that the Gods were all born during that holy time, and there would never be another like them,” he finally said. “Still, it is worthwhile that we spread our enlightenment and the glory of the Gods with the rest of world. Much of Marthia believes in our Gods, but need direction in how to follow them. *We* can provide that.”

Most of the Athers nodded in agreement, but some shook their heads, sputtered, and a small few even turned to leave.

“Ah-ah. Is there any other questions?” Arten asked.

“Yes, here,” a tall, wrinkled man with frizzy hair raised his hand.

“Go on.”

“You’ve heard that Aldwin’s son is running, correct? A young lad, not even a High Ather yet, only served for a few years! And I’ve heard rumours about the strength of his Dedication that I shall not spread, but I know you all can infer,” man replied. “Do you think someone like that should even be allowed to run?”

Arten shook his head. “Impalias Aldwin is one of the most respected men in The Citadel, and for good reason. I do not doubt he has raised his son well, and I have no idea what you’re talking about. I’ve only heard good things about the boy. In fact, if anyone besides me should win, it should be him.”

The questioner’s lips hung open, and he looked to the older men below him, who were also looking at each other with mouths agape. They group looked back to Arten, who smiled awkwardly.

“W-well,” Arten said. “I believe I must be going now. Thank you all again for coming and for all your questions.”

The High Ather rushed out of the pew, bowing to the altar before turning to tailgate for the main doors at the front of the church.

“That was rather strange. I’m still stuck between him and Trenton, if I’m going to be honest,” one of the Athers said to another, as the group dispersed.

_That **was** rather strange. The elections are always cordial, yes, but supporting a candidate that’s such a wildcard and likely has such differing views? _

Okin stared down the aisle, through the group of chatting Athers. Artem was just making his way to the exit doors while the rest of them strolled at a more casual pace in front of him.

The candidate pushed open one of the doors with his bodyweight, revealing the bustling street on the other side.

“Excuse me,” Okin said, making his way through the small crowd of Athers. “Sorry.”

The armoured Ather sped down the aisle, the clank of his boots suppressed by the carpet which lay atop the hard granite floor.

He pushed open a heavy wooden door with each gauntleted hand, and walked into a swarming crowd. Through the already lifting visor, further meddled by the mass of moving people, Okin couldn’t see Arten anywhere. 

*Guess I’m on to the next stop, then,* he thought, stomping down in rage with a hefty boot.
