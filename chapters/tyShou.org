* General Style Notes
:generaleditonenotes:
- The details and visualization is good and inspiring.
- Be more careful with the grammar, there were many incomplete or improper sentences.
- in general, sentences can sometimes be two abrupt, especially the description ones. While of course run on sentences are bad, it is kind of a waste of words and awkward to have to identical description sentences that just repeat the subject and verb again, or  at least substituties of them, e.g: "Nick had shimmering green eyes. He had long brown hair. His skin was pale. He wore a crimson red jacket that always looked too loose." can easily be 1-2 sentences instead of 4.
- use words instead of numbers for numbers

Ty-Shou was three years old, but not a child. He had appeared fully formed in a ball of Light. The people of Bei-San claimed he was the reincarnation of a long dead god. Every step Ty-Shou took in the city was met with rapturous praise. People told him of all the legendary feats he had accomplished in his past life. They said that Ty-Shou built the city of Bei-San itself, that he had sheltered the people from the great turmoil of the Age of the Gods, that he had been able to transform people into the best versions of themselves.
He didn't remember any of it.
"My Synodontis, please focus," the use of Ty-Shou's formal title cut through his introspection. The words came from Wo-Sa, his closest advisor and the man that guided him through his return, and the rise of fame that had come with it. Wo-Sa had the silver hair— thinning at the temples— and silver eyes typical of a Bei-Sanian. His wrinkled bronze skin was similarly typically of the city's populous. He was shorter than the average Bei-Sanian, and almost two heads shorter than Ty-Shou, but he carried himself with authority regardless. The old man easily filled the voluminous multi-coloured robes favoured by the cities' aristocrats. His own colours were more muted than those worn by the two other servants in the room.
"We've had this lesson a thousand times already. Can we at least go outside if we're going to be repeating lessons?" Wo-Sa insisted on conducting Ty-Shou's lessons in the same room every day, no matter the season or weather. The room was at the heart of the palace and had no windows. It was lit in an iridescent glow from the Light Crystals around its perimeter.
"If you stayed engaged throughout the lesson, perhaps I could rest assured that you understood the material." Ty-Shou hated the soft, suffering look Wo-Sa so often had. "Now, what is this Crystal used for?"
Wo-Sa proffered a perfectly black Crystal, one that appeared more as an absence of light than an actual object.
"It's a Dark Crystal. A full Dark Crystal," Wo-Sa gestured with his fingers, urging Ty-Shou to go on. "This one is filled with a memory of a great battle. You're going to use your Heraldry to show me the memory so I understand how brutal the Vareeshi are."
"Good, but do not roll your eyes when you speak. The Synodontis does not roll their eyes."
Ty-Shou rolled his eyes again. The young god truly didn't understand this song and dance. From his first lessons in geopolitics, Wo-Sa had emphasized how brutal the Vareeshi religion was. It assumed no morals beside might makes right and winner takes all, where people swore themselves to great men in the hope they would conquer all and lead them to eternal paradise. In Bei-San, the Vareeshi were a religious minority. But it was the only way of life for most of the neighbouring Central Marthian nations. Now that Ty-Shou was to leave the city for the first time, Wo-Sa had been insistent on reviewing and amplifying every lesson he had had on the Vareeshi. Wo-Sa still thought Ty-Shou didn't properly understand it, and had devised to show him a memory of Vareeshi brutality. Wo-Sa helped seeing how they made their hierarchies, and how brutal the King Making fighting was would work better than lecturing Ty-Shou.
With a flourish of from the older man's hand the two servants covered the Light Crystals, plunging the room into darkness. Wo-Sa's weathered fingers gripped Ty-Shou's forehead. The outline of the Crystal in the advisor's hand gave a false glow as Ty-Shou felt himself plunging into the false sleep of memory viewing.

Ty-Shou didn't know much about the man who's memories he now inhabited. The Synodontis knew instantly that his new body was shorter than his real one. Height was always one of easiest ways for Ty-Shou to spot an inserted memory.
He stood near the centre of a vast circular chamber. Pillars of painted red wood around the perimeter rose 50 feet up to hold up a wooden ceiling, intricately engraved with Vareeshi writing. On all sides of Ty-Shou a frantic mob pushed in, jockeying for position. Everyone in the chamber fixated on a towering triangle in the very centre, nearly the height of the chamber itself. Ty-Shou knew from his lessons that the triangle was made of a specific wood, found only in the Central Marthian valleys where the Vareeshi monks made their homes. The triangle was split into multiple tiers, each bigger than then the last, and filled with intricately designed wooden balls.
Ty-Shou held a similar wooden ball in his hand. Half his ball was plain wood, the other intricately carved and painted. He knew the ball was meant to represent the life journey of the person who's memory he inhabited, but Ty-Shou was unable to properly interpret the precise, dense writing and images on it.
The ranks of the crowd inched forward, and Ty-Shou found himself at the head of the crowd before long. Near the base of the triangle, a monk in grey robes stood with his hand out for Ty-Shou. Ty-Shou watched his hand move and place the ball in the monk's palm. The monk placed it at the bottom of the triangle, in last place. Once the ball was in place, another monk--- in the same gray robes ---handed Ty-Shou a circular tag with a number on it. Ty-Shou knew it was a very large number, the same number as the amount of balls now in the pyramid. Ty-Shou placed the tag around his neck, like everyone else in the chamber had. That same monk called out his name with his number, and the crowd yelled it back in a chant. Suddenly, Ty-Shou felt the edges of his consciousness blurring as the memory skipped forward.

The memory rematerialized as Ty-Shou found himself in the middle of a battle. He was shoulder to shoulder with other men, all holding spears. Mere feet away, the enemy formation of spears thrust forward. All the men he could see wore simple leather armour. This memory was old, at least four-hundred years old, according to Wosa.

A spear tip grazed Ty-Shou's cheek, and he felt searing pain shoot through his body. An equally intense freezing fear set into his bones. Ty-Shou couldn't tell if the fear was his own, or from the memory. Before he could decide, he felt himself jolt forward in a lunge. His spear tip danced past an enemy spear and found purchase in their neck. Shoulders pressed up against Ty-Shou as his formation took a step forward. The man next to him dropped as the enemy thrust forward. Ty-Shou's spear frantically worked to parry incoming attacks, but the enemy formation pressed forward endlessly. Pained moans from his allies filled the air. Men from the back ranks of the formation moved to fill the gaps as the injured were dragged to the back. A whistle blew and Ty-Shou was pulled back as a new front rank swapped in. He felt exhausted, more than he ever had in his short life. His body sagged with the effort, and leaning on his spear was all that kept Ty-Shou from slumping.
The yelling from the formation's head grew louder and nearer. His grasp on Vareeshi was weak, but he was sure the yelling was in a dialect he hadn't been taught. Around him men snapped to attention. Ty-Shou's grip on his spear tightened. A sudden wave of motion knocked him on the ground as a group of the enemy burst through the ranks.
Two men led the charge of the enemy spearhead. The nearest had long black hair tied in a bun above his head and a slender face. He wore light leather armour, like the other enemy soldiers. Three men charged him, and each was easily defeated. The man weaved through attacks perfectly, parrying each with his straight-edged blade. The second man had short, cropped black hair, and a scar across his left eye. Three discs spun around him creating a protective radius around a foot wide. Ty-Shou knew this was obviously Space Heraldry.
The Space Herald's eyes snapped to Ty-Shou and a disc came flying towards him. He rolled in the bloody dirt, causing the disc to barely miss. The second man must have been a powerful Herald to move the disc so fast. He scrambled to his feet, barely dodging as the disc came back around. The Herald was keeping his distance well, his ally dispatching attacks before they could threaten the Herald. The long-haired man moved with inhuman efficiency. He slipped between spears and parried attacks in perfect rhythm, with no wasted energy in each action. It was the same pattern of attack, repeated. The long-haired man would slip an opportunistic attack from behind, before lunging for the man in front of him. His blade thrust between his victim's armour. Before the dying man could drop to the ground, the lightning-quick swordsman would reach out with his off-hand to grab the number tag around his victim's neck.
Ty-Shou felt fear from the man who's memory he inhabited, but the god knew what the inhumane attack was. A Time Herald. One of the Subject Tree. It explained his superhuman reactions to attacks he shouldn't logically have time to react to, and how he always managed to perfect place himself and his blade. Judging by the number of number tags in his hand the man must have killed nearly three dozen men in his rampage. Two Heralds as skilled as these two could easily break route a hundred men undisciplined men. Ty-Shou saw it happening. The fear building in the soldiers around him, those near the back looking to flee and being pushed back by the elite rear guard. He let out  fierce roar and charged towards the Space Herald. A disc shot out from the Herald in response. Ty-Shou ducked his head and felt the disc graze the top of his hair. Two shouts rose from the crowd as two other soldiers joined Ty-Shou. He could feel his heart beat in his ears as he ran. In three years, his heart had never beat so strongly.
They were fifteen paces off the Space Herald now, maybe twelve from his defensive radius. Two discs came at him now, one flying from around the Herald, the other coming in on the right flank. The soldier on his right caught the clean across the throat. The disc slowed to a brief crawl as the Space Herald pulled the soldiers number tag off and towards the Herald. Ty-Shou thrust out at the head on disc, managing to knock it enough to make the Space Herald loose control.
They were ten paces off now, and the Space Herald had only one disc remaining. If Ty-Shou could close the gap before he brough the other two discs back on defense, he had a chance to kill the Herald.
A shoulder slammed into Ty-Shou. He stuck the butt of his spear in the ground, barely keeping upright. Before he could turn his head a punch clocked him clean across his face, and he was sent flying back to the bloody dirt. The final other soldier in Ty-Shou's desperate charge neared enough to thrust at the Time Herald. The Herald leaned his body perfectly enough to dodge the thrust. The soldier pulled his spear back and the Herald slipped down the shaft to within the weapons reach.
Ty-Shou jumped to his feet to defend his fellow soldier. He pulled a short dagger from his belt and jumped on the shoulders of the Time Herald. The Herald thrashed trying to throw Ty-Shou off. He locked his legs and elbow around the opponent and stabbed down with his dagger. The Herald jerked his hand up to catch Ty-Shou's forearm. The other soldier, discarding his spear, ran up to kick out the Heralds leg. The Herald rapidly twisted around the kick. In the same motion he jerked Ty-Shou's arm down and over, shifting his body weight into a throw.
For the third time in the fight Ty-Shou felt himself thrown onto the ground, this time he was on top of his ally. The whizzing of a Space disc cut the air as it embedded himself in the other nameless solider. Ty-Shou rolled off the body but was pressed to the ground by the Time Herald. He tried to stab the Herald's leg but he had lost the dagger in his fall. His unarmed punch barely phased the Herald as he plunged his sword down and between Ty-Shou's eyes.

Ty-Shou was panting and covered in cold sweats when he came out of the memory. The servants had uncovered the Light Crystals at some point.
"Do you understand now?" Wo-Sa asked.
Ty-Shou felt sluggish coming out of the memory and could barely move his head to nod, but his body was still shivering. "That was... what was that feeling? I-I've never felt anyuthing like ."
"Fear," Wo-Sa said solemnly. "It is one of the most common, and important emotions. It has been a failing of mine that I did not get you to experience it sooner."
"Why-- how could that be so common? So important?" Ty-Shou looked up to his advisor with wide eyes. He remembered that Wo-Sa had told him of horrible wars, and that the world was far more chaotic beyond the palace walls, but what possible reason could there be for people to feel like /this/, and for it to be /right?/

"I'm glad you understand that now."
Ty-Shou knew his heart wasn't racing, but he could still hear the drumming of a heartbeat in his ears. The lingering effects of the memory but have been evident, as Wo-Sa knelt down to meet Ty-Shou's seated eye level.
"You are the most powerful Herald to have ever lived. Those Heralds in the vision have barely a fraction of your power, my Synodontis." Wo-Sa reached out to grab Ty-Shou's hand. "I've tried to instill in you how powerful you are, how much capacity for good you have. Perhaps now you understand both how brutal the Vareeshi are, and how much power you hold-- to prevent others from having the same fate-- the same /fear/-- as the man in that vision."
Ty-Shou didn't reply, only nodded. If this really was how the world was, Wo-Sa was right-- he did have a duty.
"Come, it's time to leave for Cong Lang. We must ensure we make all our appearances at the festivities before King Making begin in earnest."
Ty-Shou rose from the chair with a nod. "Of course."


The streets of Bei-San were overcrowded for his procession out of the city. Ty-Shou rode in a two-tiered carriage, pulled by six horses. The carriage had been originally commissioned by the Stewards of Bei-San, the noble family appointed to lead the councils of nobles and govern Bei-San in Ty-Shou's stead. The carriage was a reflection of the prestige and history of the city: it was made of black lacquered wood, with a polished gold trim along it's edges, and the panels were engraved with art depicting the most famous of Ty-Shou's feats. The door panel had his favourite engraving; it pictured him standing against a dragon coiling around the world.
The bottom tier was designed as a regular carriage for long distance travel. It had padded seats, which could be made out into a full bed by his servants. Light curtains gave privacy, but allowed in a light breeze while on the move. The top level was a viewing platform. A waist hair railing ran around it's edge, allowing Ty-Shou to stand and wave out at the Bei-Sanian citizens as his carriage wound its way out from the palace at the city's heart.
Wo-Sa had held back no level of splendor for the parade. The trip to Cong Lang had a stripped-down escort, despite that every one of his mounted Royal Guards had on perfect dress uniforms. A long stark white tunic which flowed down to below the knees, cut in the middle to allow for comfortable riding. A golden belt secured at their waist gave the top of the uniform a sharp triangular silhouette, and the tunic was trimmed in the same shade of gold. Their tall black hats provided minimal shade, with a thin rim. The symbol of Bei-San was embroidered in the centre of the chest: a blazing sixteen-pointed sun held in the palm of Ty-Shou's hand. 
The Imperial Guard were selected for their size and strength. No man was shorter than Ty-Shou; all were at least twelve hands tall. Each wore two weapons. A long sword for unmounted combat, and a curved cavalry blade.
At their head was Ji-Xing. The head of Ty-Shou's guard, and Field Marshall, wore a white hat to match his white uniform. At forty-five man was past his physical prime, but could easily beat five of the other Royal Guard at once. fhis face was nearly a perfect square with a jawline that could cut glass. A scar across his eye gained during his youth only added to the his fierce appearance.
As they passed alleys, Ty-Shou could see people lining up thirty, even fifty ranks deep to try and get a glimpse of their god. From the window of passing houses, and from the nearest ranks on the street, Ty-Shou could hear Bei-Sanians yelling for blessings. Some even prostrated themselves on the pavement in attempt to garner his favour. A yell to bless a sickly relative. A cry to aid a son on an examination. They were all cries Ty-Shou had heard before, and all aid Ty-Shou had no power to grant.
His powers allowed him to heal some of the sick and wounded, but only if he was in the correct mental state. But he couldn't bless people with better fortune, or perform any true miracles. He was a powerful Herald, and some really believed that one day he would bless them all with great fortune, and perform great and holy miracles. And so, they didn't just call him a great Herald, or even 'king', or 'majesty.' They called him God.

Jakari's ball was as elegant as he had promised it would be. The city itself may have been poor in comparison to Bei-San, but the palace at its heart was an equal match. It's size and opulence had been clear from the moment Ty-Shou entered the city. Yet, he found himself in awe of the beauty as he approached.
The palace had been under construction for three generations--- commissioned as a sign of Cong Lang's post-Delmian independence --- and had only been completed 50fifty years ago. The complex sat upon the city's name sake, Cong Lang or the river hill. The hill around which the two life blood rivers of Central Marthia merged to create the river Keesh. The Yahl River, which shot down the Nihdan mountains and through Delmia, and the Tacuk which weaved from the Northern Strait. The confluence of the two rivers had given the city influence, power, prestige, and wealth. Now they had built this palace to reflect all of it.
Ty-Shou's escort for the event was a compliment of only three. Ji-Xing, his protege Qi-An, and their carriage driver. The invitation had specified that only two servants would be allowed per guest, so Ty-Shou had taken a two man carriage tonight. Across from him, Qi-An sat with his attention out the window. The young guard sat straight-backed and coiled for action. His internal anxiety was given away only by the rapid drumming of his fingers against his sword hilt.
Ty-Shou had been content to attend alone, he had in fact been looking forward to it. But Wo-Sa had lectured that it was improper for a man of his station to travel without a guard. Ty-Shou didn't end up minding and enjoyed a talk with the driver about his travels abroad during the ride, and he felt his excitement for the event spill out into his conversation-- especially when the guard talked about how beautiful the world was. Here he was, for the first time, outside Bei-San, ready to talk to others like him who weren't the same boring old nobles in Bei-San. He imagined dancing, singing, and as their surroundings got prettier and prettier, his imagination did too.
The carriage came to a stop in a crowded stone square at the bottom of the hill. A guard dressed in Cong Lang indigo and teal conversed with the driver, pointing to an open spot at the edge of the square where he could park. Past the guard, Ty-Shou could see other dignitaries departing their carriages. Some wore the more traditional single piece Marthian tunics, while others wore the more modern Kaihanese suits and dresses.
The flowing oversized dresses of the women were unlike any that he had seen worn in Bei-San. Wide neck lines plunged to to reveal enough skin to make Ty-Shou blush. The colours were more intricate, yet more muted than the ones worn in traditional clothing, favouring detail over bright ostentation. The modern suits of the men were tightly fitting. Their pants rose high on the waist and were paired buttoning tunics. Each man also wore a jacket with tails flowing down to their calfs.
Ty-Shou found their absence of head coverings most interesting. The Vareeshi minority in Bei-San wrapped their long hair in silk coverings above their head. He saw similar styling in some of the guests around the square, but many had their hair visible in intricate braids, flaunting the traditional covering of hair. Others wore hats, or shawls.
:comment:
"flaunting the traditional covering of hair" is a bit confusing here cause they aren't really covering their hair, and 'visible' and 'covering' are such antonyms. I only know what you mean cause we discussed and created this
:END:
A knock came at the door as Ji-Xing pulled the carriage door open. "We're to walk the rest of the path up to the palace, my Synodontis."
Ty-Shou nodded, "We have no complaints." He tried to keep the serious formalities as Wo-Sa had directed him, but it was difficult to contain his excitement.
Ji-Xing took a step away from the carriage, allowing Ty-Shou to descend himself. The square smelled of sweet tobacco. Coachmen awaiting their charges lounged smoking pipes or playing card games with the other servants which had been denied entry. Qi-An coughed at the smell and followed behind Ty-Shou.
At the gate, Ji-Xing gestured Qi-An forward and the younger man proffered their invite to the guard. The guard looked it over for a long moment. Did he not trust Ty-Shou? Why was he scrutinizing the Synodontis' invitation?
A flare of energy rushed through Ty-Shou's blood as he felt Indignation flare in him. The energy rushed to his finger tips, begging to be infused into an object.
He took a deep breath and let the emotion fade. The rush of power subsided.
The trio was let through the gate with a simple wave. No bow. Not even a note of gratitude for his presence. Only his escort spiriting him past the gate kept him for activating the full force of his power on the gate guard.

maybe this is too unsubtle and extreme
:END:
The path up to the palace was a beautiful walk. Light lamps lined the path, shimmering iridescent light over the cobbled path. Trees on either side arched over the path isolating the background chatter of the city. As they walked the path only the occasional croak of a toad or buzz of a bug could be heard. The path wound its way around the hill at a steady incline.
The path up to the palace was a beautiful walk. Light lamps lined the path, shimmering iridescent light over the cobbled path. Trees on either side arched over the path isolating the background chatter of the city,  only the occasional croak of a toad or buzz of a bug could be heard.
"Bastards forced us to walk," Ji-Xing said in Bei-Sanian. The other parties were close enough to hear him, but none of them appeared to speak the language. "It's a power play, they want to tire us out."
"We do not think so," Ty-Shou said. Inside, he was flabbergasted that someone could be dissappointed in being 'forced' to take in such a spectacular view, and a new one, too. But he understood that Ji-Xing, for all his wisdom, was an army man. Every problem was military, every action one step towards winning an unseen battle. "It's a display of opulence, not power," Ty-Shou said.
Ty-Shou heard Qi-An gasp as the trio stepped out from under the tree cover onto a carved stone outcropping. The city of Cong Lang and the royal grounds of the palace spread out beneath them. The hill and a large swath around it had been gated off for the royal grounds. Garden paths curved around water gardens and under huge drooping trees. There were no hard lines or symmetry in the layout. Everything had been arranged to flow naturally with the land. How much of the land was artificial was impossible to tell.
From his vantage point Ty-Shou could see the dense city within the walls and far beyond to the towns and farms surrounding it. Ships laden with cargo drifted lazy past each other as they went up the two rivers. From above, drifted the muted music of the ball. No map could have ever conveyed the scale of the city to Ty-Shou. Bei-San held it's majesty in its history, beauty, and its people. But Cong Lang's sheer scale was nearly enough to dwarf those all. Ty-Shou totally forgot he was a god here-- he only remembered that he was basically a child.
Ty-Shou felt eyes on him from the stragglers on the platform. He had no idea how long he had been staring out at the city. It couldn't have been longer than a handful of minutes. However long it was, was enough to cause a scene. Holding his head high, the god swept past the onlookers and up the final dozen or so steps to the palace itself.
At the top of the hill, a path lined with guards every ten paces led them towards the open doors of the entry hall. The entry hall jutted out, rising as high as a six story building to a steep slanted tip. Like the rest of the palace was made of a variety of stone from all over Central Marthia, all neutral shades of white, grey, or black. Perpendicular to the flanks of the hall the west and east wings grew. The two wings were identical, defined by their curved glass roofs and huge glass windows. Each window was identical, five paces wide, sixty tall, and placed at fifteen pace intervals. Between them, the same white stone as the hall served as the frame work. Ty-Shou had never seen windows so large before. However, it was the curved glass roof, which rose almost as dome, that was the true marvel of the palace.
Vang-Do glass blowers had been commissioned for the project. They were the best not just in the Marthia, but the world. Like all the artisans guild in Vang Do, the glass blowers were a pretentious, pompous, egotistical institutions. One Ty-Shou was not eager to deal with any time soon.
"For such a violent people, you'd think they'd make more secure palaces. I could take this with two squads. Less if we had Heralds." Ji-Xing let out a small scoff as he looked over the Cong Lang guards.
A small smile of pride crept onto Ty-Shou's lips. He didn't doubt his Royal Guards could.
"I believe I could do it with a Dark, Space, and another Time Herald," Qi-An said.
His mentor raised an eye brow in response. "Not very confident are you? You need two Time Heralds?"
"Well they'd all be single Schools! Illusion, Teleporation--"
"Quiet," Ty-Shou said. "We approach the steward."
Qi-An took two broad stride slipping infront of Ty-Shou. The older guard slipped back to guard the Synodontis' rear. Qi-An produced their invite once again and handed it to the man at the entrance.
"Synodontis Ty-Shou Xing of Bei-San and company," the steward's voice was amplified by the architecture of the ante-chamber and a short call of horns followed. The hall was large enough that the stewards words seemingly hadn't reached the far end of the hall. At the far end of the hall, one massive throne sat in front of pyramid, filled with balls, large enough to stretch the full height of the hall.
Ty-Shou struggled to distinguish the figures crowded around the thrown at the far end of the hall. It was more Overwhelming then he had expected-- closer to a intersecting schools of fish and less like the dramatic stage Ty-Shou had dexpected. Jakari was easily identifiable by his place on his father's throne. The two smaller chairs in front--- typically for Jakari and his sister ---were empty. Another silhouette stood by the throne, likely the advisor. In front of the three thrones was a dance floor which took up the majority of the hall.
Despite the palace and ball being all he could have imagined, a distinct twinge of disappointment flashed in Ty-Shou. It was a familiar emotion, but the cause this time was surprising.
"What now my Synodontis?" Ji-Xing surveyed the crowd, his hand not touching, but never drifting from his short sword.
"We will enjoy the refreshments, and speak if spoken to." The two royal guards nodded.
The initial crowd of people seemed to be mostly lower level dignitaries and business people. No face Wo-Sa had told him about. They congregated around small but high tables, all nursing a drink proper to their gender. Conversations could hear the conversations as he passed. Most were in languages he couldn't understand, but could identify. Some were from Central Marthia, and some from farther beyond. He heard the sweet tonal rising and falling of the commonwealth, the hissing of Trentanian, and even the guttural clipped speech from Apathasaw.
"Synodontis!" A voice came from the edge of the crowds, where it gave way to the dance floor. The crowd parted as the voice approached.
It came from a man in his late thirties. He had cool bronze skin and soft, nearly feminine features. His long black hair was tied in two thin braids which fell to small of his back. His nose was scarred, and bent from being set in place more than once.
"King Ruit of Khua," Ty-Shou said in Delmian. The man was easy to recognize from the memories Wo-Sa had given him. He wore a single piece tunic, and a thin belt tied in a flowery knot cinched his belt at the waist.  Over his shoulders he wore a cloakshawl of sheer black material. It was embroidered with the golden six petal flower of his house. Tassels of the same gold hung around the shawl's edge.
"Synodontis," the king tipped his head down in reverence. Ty-Shou waited for the man's gesture to deepen to a bow. Instead, Ruit rose to stand straight. "I'm glad to make your acquittance. Your reputation proceeds you."
"We have heard much of you as well," Ty-shou straightened his back fully.
"How did Jakari convince you to attend?" Ruit took a sip of his drink as he raised an eyebrow. "Bribery? That's how he got me."
Ty-Shou's eyes narrowed. "You accuse us of taking a /bribe?/"
"Bribes, yes," the king took a long moment finishing his drink. "Favours, a promise of audience with the boy's father, a meeting with the dockers' guild, an opportunity to court his sister. Everybody who's anybody received something to attend."
Ty-Shou felt a slight tinge rise in his cheeks. He pushed the blush down with his disgust.
:question:
is this a Light heraldry use?
:END:
"What were you promised?" /Money? Men? Weapons?/ Ruit was a brutal warlord, having made his claim when he could barely grow facial hair. Ty-Shou had been told that the young king's ambition made him dangerous.
"Tickets to the opera," Ruit replied with a laugh. "I give the boy credit, he knows his guests well."
Ty-Shou blinked. "The opera?"
"Yes, in Cong Lang. Everyone knows the opera houses in Vang Do are superior of course," Ty-Shou nodded, though he did not know that, and even though he knew rather little, felt like not 'everyone' did either. He was excited to meet someone with an actual interest, but he felt intimidated due to his lack of opera knowledge.  "But Cong Lang is one of the few cities with true artistic culture," Ruit finished.
From just outside the conversation, Ji-Xing scoffed. Ruit whirled on the man, "Was my statement humourous?"
"Not precisely, I was just curious. Which cities do you believe have /true artistic culture/? Khua?" Ty-Shou levelled a glare at Ji-Xing. He did not want to reprimand the head of his guard publicly. But he would have to in order to appease Ruit.
The king burst out in a hearty laugh. "No, no. Not Khua," Ruit let out a long sigh. "Not yet. But by the time of my death, it will. My people have nearly completed construction on our new theatre. The largest in the coalition. In time we will build great statues, and galleries, and one day the sweet song of opera will fill my city's streets."
Ruit had the twinkle of a dreamer in his eyes as he spoke. It was true, every word he said. Or at least, he believed it be so.
"We have many great stone masons in our lands," Ty-Shou said.
Ruit leaned in, "is that truly so? Perhaps I will have to come during King Making to recruit some."
Confusion turned in Ty-Shou's belly. He had tried to relate to this interloper, and the king had mocked him. He wanted to reach out to grab Ruit's face. How funny would the joke seem when Ty-Shou infused his indignant rage onto the king's skin?
Ruit let out the same laugh he had only moments ago before his face fell to a frown.  "Ah, it appears I finished my drink."
A lady appeared from the crowd. She had the same skin tone as Ruit and worse, a modern dress, one with a fashionable low cut neck line.
Ty-Shou averted his gaze as the woman hooked her arms around Ruit's. She whispered something in the king's ear and they shared a private laugh. Ruit looked between the new woman and Ty-Shou as a slight frown crept onto the king's face.
"It appears I am required elsewhere," Ruit nodded his head once again to Ty-Shou, then to Ji-Xing. "Don't be a stranger, Synodontis."
The couple disappeared into the crowd. That word, 'stranger', stung Ty-Shou's heart. As the Synodontis, even though all those below him may see it like he was above them, that was what he was forced to be, a stranger. Even on the ride here, the carriage driver was obviously surprised by Ty-Shou's interest in him, and had to ease into conversation with him.
The distress must have shown in Ty-Shou face. Ji-Xing leaned in to whisper as hand went to his sword. Even though the interaction was confusing, he wanted it to go on longer, and felt like he was missing something.
"My Synodontis?" Ji-Xing asked. "Are you well?"
The older guard made a series of hand motions Ty-Shou couldn't understand. His two guards each held an arm, bolstering Ty-Shou. He shrugged them off instead. "Do not make a scene general."
The pang had dulled to a low ache but was still unidentifiable. Ty-Shou pushed the pain away focusing instead on the crowd of onlookers. A rough circle of onlookers formed around him, all whispering amongst themselves. After a long moment, one man stepped forward and bowed.
"Synodontis, I am lord Nuanaak..."


The next several hours of dragged on with introductions. Ty-Shou remembered maybe a quarter of their names, and cared about even less. His Disappointment had grown so much, almost enough that he felt like he needed to channel it-- it seemed like everyone he talked to didn't actually want to talk, they just felt they needed to make an introduction. He was anxious to move from the lobby to the banquet hall, and thought he was about to faint from boredom by the time they started ushering people in.
The banquet was held in the palace's great hall, a vaunted stone hall who's ceiling seemed to reach up into the clouds. Carved stone pillars ribbed the hall, rising to support the dauntingly tall hall. A mezzanine ran the length of the hall on either side, giving dignitaries a more private place to talk.
The Bei-Sanian party entered from the wooden double doors at the front of the hall. The vast room was long enough that Ty-Shou struggled to make out the figure of Jakari and his sister atop of their thrones at the far end of the hall. At their feet was a dance floor--- where men and women engaged in the traditional mixed gender dances ---past that was a sea of
:fix:
you didn't end this sentence
:END:
Such a vast hall was required to accommodate the thousands of members in attendance, as anyone who had a shred of influence or prestige in the coalition would be here. The laughs and casual but energetic dancing told Ty-Shou everyone was having a good time. It flabbergasted him that with only a slight movement of the moon, all of them would be trying to kill each other.
Ji-Xing entered ahead of Ty-Shou, his prodigy Qi-An taking up the rear, both in Royal Guard white. All guests in attendance had been limited to two servants, and while some of the leaders had tried to get around this limiation, Ty-Shou barely had need for servants, body guards even less so. But Wo-Sa had always insisted that it would be improper for such an important figure to travel without a guard.
The West wing's interior beauty easily matched its exterior architecture. The room off the great hall spanned the total height of the wing, allowing sweeping views through the towering windows. Art, lit be candles, adorned the space between windows. Two tables on either side of the room were filled with food. Plates were set out in a buffet style, organized from spicy to sweet. Stewards patrolled the room, cleaning away finished meals, organizing food, or bringing drinks. In the centre of the room, a large table was set for fifty guests, though less than then sat eating. He recognized two of the people at the table. Kitsai and the towering man that had been with her in the market.
Ty-Shou averted his eyes from the table to the food at the side. He made his way down the table, focusing on the rows of food. Most were unfamiliar to him, and smelled of strange spices.
Finally, the smell of one dish caught his attention. It appeared to be chicken. It's skin looked crisp, and was a deep red colour. They had plated it on a bed of long grained rice.
"It's good, you should try it," a feminine voice said in Delmian. Ty-Shou's heart picked up, and he looked up to see Kitsai two dishes down, her body guard a further three paces back. She wore her hair in a single wide pleated braid. She wore a Kaihani dress, but didn't obey the fashion of the women at the ball. Her neckline was up in defiance of the plunging ones Ty-Shou had seen all night. It formed a tight collar, adding to the slimming effect from her comparatively straight skirts. The maroon colour and silver detailing of the dress complimented her pale skin.
"What is it?"
The woman shrugged as she picked up a baked pastry from a silver platter. "My brother handles the menu, I simply come to observe his work."
"How do you know if it is good?" Ty-Shou asked.
"Cause Jakari isn't very creative," a small smile tugged at Kitsai's lips. "Or perhaps our head chef isn't. But the menu always contains repeated favourites. That one has been on the menu for the last three years."
A steward patrol crept up from behind Kitsai. The princess waved the man off before he could open his mouth.
"I'll call you if I need something, Vaitran," she seemed to pause before turning to look at Ty-Shou. "Do you want anything Synodontis?"
Ty-Shou was taken aback by the sudden usage of his title. She hadn't said it with emphasis like everyone else, instead she had used it as if it were his name.
"We would be greatly pleased by tea, Yue tea," Ty-Shou turned to look at Qi-An. "My guard will have water."
The steward nodded and ran off through a servants door at the back of the room.
"Just tea?" Kitsai asked as she ripped the pastry in her hands apart. Ty-Shou could see it was stuffed with spiced meat.
"We do not drink alcohol." Ty-Shou said as he took a step towards the pastries.
"Many would call that a sad life."
"We pity those who rely on such vices."
Kitsai smirked, "don't let the ones out there hear you. Some of those /kings/ and /lords/ out there do not take kindly to pity."
"We care not."
"You might," Kitsai took a bite out of the pastry. Ty-Shou felt his mouth water. "Emperor Voto is one of those men."
Ty-Shou thought he had recognized the Emperor of Delrei in the crowd.
"The emperor is quite the reveller. He-"
Ty-Shou cut the woman off, blurting out, "what is it that you are eating?"
Kitsai furrowed her brow, holding up the half eaten pastry. "This? It's a meat pie. Do you not have meat pies in your land Synodontis?"
The two Bei-Sanians shook their head. "Our people prefer sweet pastries."
The meat pie Kitsai held was antithetical to Bei-Sanian baking. Not only was it savoury, but it had been baked in a thick dough. Totally unlike the airy, flaky pastries in Bei-San.
The woman took a step forward and handed Ty-Shou the unmolested half of her meat pie. He took the pie without hesitation. The meat smelled unlike any blend of spices he had tried before. The taste was exquisite and the texture unique.
Kitsai let out a small giggle as she finished her half of the pie. "Now I have to try a Bei-Sanian pastry. It's only fair Synodontis."
The rising sound of approaching foot falls came through the servants door. The door burst open and a man Ty-Shou recognized as the king's advisor rushed out.
"Anut?" Kitsai called out as the man rushed through the dinning room. She called out again in a language Ty-Shou couldn't understand. She seemed to curse as she motioned her body guard forward.
"I apologize Synodontis. I'm afraid I must take my leave," she said.
Kitsai took to chasing Anut. Ty-Shou imagined all the things that could make Wo-Sa rush like that. None of them were good.
In a split second Ty-Shou was following Kitsai. Qi-An kept up well as the pair carved their way through an increasingly concerned crowd. They only made it half way up the dance floor before the press of bodies was too great to push past.
Over the heads of the other guests Ty-Shou saw Anut mount the stairs the throne. Jakari was engaged in conversation with a women he recognized as Maleesh. Seeing the urgency in Anut's steps, the prince motioned Maleesh off. The advisor leant down to whisper in Jakari's ear. Even from this distance, Ty-Shou could see the younger man pale.
Jakari stood and clapped to draw his guest's attention. "Excuse me, I have an urgent matter to attend to. Please, enjoy my sister's company in the interim."
Kitsai was at the foot of the steps up the throne now. She rushed up to her brother's side, but was waved off by the advisor. She attempted to grab hold of her brother, but was shaken off. Her yell of protest was loud enough to carry to Ty-Shou.
That was when it began.
Jakari stumbled, missing a step. He began to cough. Before Ty-Shou could process it, the prince had fallen down the stairs and was on the ground. Guards around the throne began to cough as well. Then a woman in the crowd, dressed in Cong Lang indigo. A man in the crowd next to Ty-Shou collapsed and convulsed on the ground. Near the throne, more of Jakari's staff began to suffer similarly.
Panic spread like a spark in dried grass.
Yelling in a dozen different languages as the throng of the crowd scrambled to push out. If Ty-Shou and Qi-An had been the height of an average Bei-Sanian, they were sure to have been trampled. The younger guard braced himself against the flood, diverting the flow around his charge.
On the stairs Kitsai stood frozen. She hadn't suffered any of the symptoms as those on the ground. She covered her face in horror as she looked down at her brother.
"We must provide assistance!" Ty-Shou proclaimed.
"Yes, my Synodontis," Qi-An held out his hand and froze a man in place with his Heraldry. The man provided a break for the crowd, giving the pair a small gap to slip forward. A moment later, the man skipped forward in time, appearing two paces forward and tumbling into the back of an unsuspecting woman. They repeated the process till they spotted the prince's body.
Jakari lay on the ground convulsing. Blood from his coughs painted the ground around him. Where were his staff? Where was Anut, the advisor? That didn't matter right now. Ty-Shou had a chance to save the prince and he had to use it.
Qi-An did his best to form a cordon, pushing fleeing guests away from Jakari's body. Getting on his knees, Ty-Shou drew in the light from the Crystals embroidered in his gown. Every piece of clothing he wore had Light Crystals sewn in instead of regular gemstones. It wasn't enough. The prince was too badly injured, he would require a great amount of Light. Ty-Shou reach out and felt light in the Crystals in the throne. He drew that Light in and felt himself surge with power as the throne lost it's ethereal glow.
Ty-Shou knew Empathy would be able to heal him. Empathy was one of a select few Light Emotions that allowed the Herald to heal. Caring could make a man's body heal faster. But Empathy, if done by a healthy Herald, could bring a man back from the brink of death. The prince was too far gone for any power except for Empathy to work.
/Pain/
/Doubt/
/Anxiety/
/Fear/
Not any fear, /fear of death/.
Ty-Shou knew /Pain/, knew /Doubt/, knew /Anxiety/. But those weren't enough. Jakari's mind was so flooded with fear that Ty-Shou needed to feel it deeply in his being for the power to work.
A body running past pushed into Ty-Shou, breaking his focus. He wanted to feel Rage. He did feel Rage. Everybody fled, and he was the only one trying to help, and they couldn't even make enough space for him to do that?
Empathy. He ha to emphasise with the /fear of death/ itself. He had rarely felt Fear. But his life had never been truly threatened. The fear and adrenaline of sparring was a poor facsimile of the emotion.
Someone let out a cry, and Ty-Shou looked up to see Kitsai's bodyguard grab her. The woman pounded on her servants back. She held at the man in but her body guard took her what had been a hidden door behind the throne.
Another body bumped into Ty-Shou, this time hard enough to send him fully to the ground. Qi-An threw the body off Ty-Shou and back into the crowd.
"My Synodontis, we need to go." Ty-Shou shook his head and resumed his position over Jakari's body. The princes' coughing was getting shallower, the coughing less frequent.
He needed more time. Ty-Shou was burning with Light, but had no outlet. His body was an imperfect container. Every second, Light leaked from him. What would Ty-Shou think about when he was on death's door step? He had no answer, no idea.
Ji-Xing burst through the crowd. "What the hell are you doing!"
"The prince, I have to save him." Ty-Shou's voice shook as he spoke.
The general took one look at the dying prince. "If you could have done it you would have by now. He's too far gone, even for you."
"No he's not!" Ty-Shou felt all his power shift into Indignation. "I am a god! I can heal what no other can!"
Light surged from his hands onto the tiled floor as he poured his Indignation out.
"Get down!" Ji-Xing pulled Ty-Shou up and put his body between the god and glowing spot on the floor. The older man's skin shifted to stone. Qi-An dove over the body of Jakari.
An explosion tore through the tiles up, shooting debris into the crowd and air.
The panic in the crowd grew to a fevered pitch.
A man screamed in Vareeshi. "We're under attack!"
* Chapter 4
"The Dragon Riders!"
"It's the Versalists!"
Panic over took the crowd as they began to brandish weapons. Plates from around the room began to fly up as Space Heralds took control.
"Qi-An, to me!" Ty-Shou was frozen by shock. Each of his arms was grabbed by a guard as the two drew daggers.
"Out of the way!" Ji-Xing yelled. No one moved.
"Out! Out of the way!" Qi-An yelled in Delmian. The crowd began to part slightly as they pushed through.
The cold outside air brought Ty-Shou slightly out of his shocked stage. Bells of alarm rang out from the city below. Servants from the square below poured up the hill side, all armed for a fight.
"Did you spot another path down?" Ji-Xing swapped his dagger for the short sword at his side.
The younger guard pointed to a break in the tree line near the West wing. "I spotted it on our way up."
"Good lad, come on! We've got a long run ahead of us! My Synodontis, come on!" Ji-Xing burst forward and motioned for Ty-Shou and Qi-An to follow. The crowd, pouring out from the palace, invaded behind them. Ty-Shou was about to protest when--
"ATTENTION!" The massive shout erupted over the crowd. It was so loud, inhumanely loud, that many clasped their hands over their ears, and many that were running stopped in their tracks.
"THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTACK. THE CITY IS UNDER LOCKDOWN," the shout came from ahead of Ty-Shou and his security, at the square below, and they clasped their ears.
"What!? Are you trying to get us killed!?" someone in the crowd shouted from behind. Ty-Shou supressed the Indignation rising up in his chest-- how dare they restrict the other leaders after inviting them here?
"FOR YOUR SAFETY, STAY CALM AND STILL. DISRUPTIVE ACTS WILL BE INTERPRETED AS AN ASSAULT ON THE CITY AND THE GUESTS."
The crowd boiled with anger and confusion. As a mass, they stayed more still than before, but little parties spread in different directions.
"Come on," Ji-Xing said. "We're still going to the compound!"
Ty-Shou tightened his lips. He didn't like being pushed around by Ji-Xing, but when the man commanded, it was instinct for even the likes of Synodontis to follow him. Which just made his feelings more complicated.
 Ty-Shou's arms shook-- the party was just getting good, just about aligning with his expectations, his hopes-- the conversation wasn't that special, but it felt like he was connecting to Kitsai, and then just like that, it was all over. When would even be the next time he would have a chance to leave Bei-San again for something like this?
 "Do they even have the right to do this? We are not their subjects, how can they restrict our right of travel?" he asked as the three of them ran.
"To be fair, it's what I would do if something similar happened in Bei-San," Ji-Xing said, his breath measured. "It's good security practice to contain the zone. But that doesn't mean we're going to follow their orders."
"I hate to be a bother, my Synodontis," Qi-An interjected. "But that shout, that was Light Heraldry, was it not? Do you know what emotion that was?"
Ty-Shou bit his lip. He knew it was Light Heraldry, as it wasn't any of the others. And he had channeled many more emotions than most were ever able to in their lifetimes, but he didn't even know which that was.
"Exasperation," Ji-Xing said. "It's one that works out quite nicely in the military-- the angrier the officer gets at his troops' incompetence, the louder and more deadly the shout. Of course it can backfire, if you actually use it against your own men."
"Deadly?" Qi-An raised en eyebrow.
Ji-Xing nodded. "You heard how loud that messenger was. If someone like Ty-Shou used it, who knows? It could shake a mountain."
Ty-Shou's insecurity at Ji-Xing knowing the answer faded. The head of security was hard, no-nonsense, and independent, but he was a true believer, and loyal, as much as an Bei-Sanian.
"Back to the topic," the Synodontis said. "Who do you think is attacking? Almost all the kings of large pyramids are here, and I didn't see any armies with them."
"It might be a set up by Cong Lang themselves, to trap all the important leaders here when king making begins," Ji-Xing said. "A bit more opportunistic than I would expect from King, but they have the most troops here, and are the most likely to win from this situation."
Ty-Shou caught his breathe before speaking again. Even though he was the eldest, Ji-Xing ran like a horse, and even the lithe Qi-An struggled to keep up.
"But it was Jakari and the other Cong Langans who got poisoned," Ty-Shou said. "You think it's just a trick?"
"If you are to underestimate anything in this world, don't let it be how far the Vareeshi will go to win king making," Ji-Xing said.
The three got back on one of the main roads from the hill that had taken as a short cut. Ty-Shou glanced around-- some of the guests were still pouring out from the general direction of the temple, and all the servants and natives, though less panicked, were generally in a rush and confused. It was a shame that such a desperate panic was coming out of such a luxurious palace. Ty-Shou turned his eyes back down the hill; Cong Lang once again amazed Ty-Shou by how it seemed to go on forever.
"What about Ruit of Khua?" Ty-Shou turned his attention back to the conversation. "He seemed ambitious and a bit... eccentric. Like someone who would have a trick up his sleeve."
Ji-Xing shook his head. "It may not be obvious from Ruit's flamboyance, but Khua is far too traditional to do something like this."
Ty-Shou's head tilted. "You just said that the Vareeshi would do anything to win in king making?"
"It's not so simple," Ji-Xing said. "Khuans are traditional Vareeshi. Though they are perhaps /the/ most cutthroat on the battlefield, nothing outmatches their sense of honor and pride. They are practically pacifists when it's not king making, and they see dirty tricks like this as especially dishonorable. Go to Khua any time of the year, and it will be much more like Ruit, just less artistic: a cheerful people obsessed with wine. That is, unless you visit a military camp."
"And they have a lot of them," Qi-An said. "Khua's armies last king making were estimated to be over one thirthieth their total population. That's more than five times the size of our army."
Ji-Xing gave Qi-An a harsh stare. Ty-Shou knew he should've felt offended on behalf of the nation, but to him, the numbers weren't that important, and even knowing him for such a short time, he could already tell that Qi-An wasn't the most socially adept, or at least the most socially normal.
"Bei-San is always growing," Ty-Shou said. "Now that I've returned."
Ji-Xing and Qi-An just nodded. /It must be especially awkward, talking to your god/, Ty-Shou realized. /Maybe I should be a little lighter around them. But-- Wo-Sa said I must always stay respectable.../
"It could be Hysho," Qi-An said. "They're one of the only large enough pyramids to have a chance at becoming truly dominant, yet the smallest of that top class, and one of the only very large pyramids that didn't show up.  It could be that they're making a desperate power play."
"That is a possibility, Qi-An," Ji-Xing said. "Your analysis is shrewd."
Ty-Shou felt a bit ashamed for knowing so little, but he brushed it off. He had only been incarnated for three years, and they still saw him as a god. Right?
"No matter who it is, even with this order, we should try to leave the city," Ji-Xing said. "We do not want to be here when king making begins."
"I don't know," Ty-Shou said. "It's unbefitting of a hero, much less a god, to run from danger. And plus, Wo-Sa told me not to upset any of the major pyramids-- I would think he would be especially mad if I upset our hosts."
Ji-Xing just gave Ty-Shou a nod, but Ty-Shou knew that that just meant this conversation would continue when they returned to the compound.
Qi-An finally caught his breath as the tiled road curved up to the grassy hill where the flat stone walls of the compound sat. It was a decent run, and Ty-Shou had used a bit of Passion to keep his endurance up.
Ahead, a quartet of armored men in teal and indigo approached. They eyed the three before lowering their spears. Cong Lang guards.
"Halt. The city is in lockdown. State your name and destination," the tallest guard stepped forward and said.
"I am Synodontis Ty-Shou Xing of Bei-San. The Great God of Light," Ty-Shou stepped forward.
"You have carriages within these walls. As mentioned, the city is in lockdown," the tall guard said.
"So you are intent on arresting a foreign leader that you invited as an honored guest?"
The guards looked between each other. It was unclear if they were preparing for an attack, or communicating something else.
"We made no such statement," one finally said.
"Then let us pass," Ty-Shou said.
The guards looked between each other again. Using his right hand, Ji-Xing clutched something in his back pocket. Inch by inch, his right arm shifted to steel.
In unison, the guards divided into two pairs to let the three pass. Ji-Xing bowed in respect as Ty-Shou and Qi-An approached the compound.
But just as Ji-Xing was about to pull the loose rope that would ring the entrance bell on the black compound gate, the clop-clop and whinny of a running horse pulled the attention of the three. The horses' stark white body glared against the inoffensive green hills, and its pitch black mane demanded the eye's focus. It had come from the hillside, also from the direction of the palace, but running a roadless, hilly path. Ty-Shou gasped in surprise-- its rider was Kitsai, but she wore open wounds and was nearly slouched over, a harsh contrast to her usual regal posture. The horse slowed its roll as it approached the three.
"Kitsai!" Ty-Shou ran up to her.
"Ty-Shou!" Ji-Xing shouted and ran to grabbed the Synodontis by the shoulders.
The Synodontis shoved his security back. He understood why the Solid Herald had used his powers to contain his Indignation at the palace, though the whole thing was a blur. But he was getting a bit too comfortable with restraining, or even touching his god.
"Do not put your hands on me, Ji-Xing!" Ty-Shou shouted.
Ji-Xing nodded and backed off, but still stood confidently concerned. "My Synodontis, we do not know if she is responsible for this attack!"
"Look at her!" Ty-Shou pointed.
"It's true, she was one of the only Cong Lang in the area to not be targeted in the initial attack, and the whereabouts of her father are still unknown," Qi-An said. "Perhaps this is a grab for power, such things are not unheard of among the Vareeshi."
"She looks like she's suffered an attack to me," Ty-Shou growled.
"Timing is important," Qi-An said, but he just stood still as Ty-Shou rushed up to Kitsai's side, and Ji-Xing turned his hand to steel again.
The horse came to a complete halt once it reached flat ground. Kitsai's hands went limp, and she fell off the horse. Ty-Shou caught her in his arms.
"I-I saw you," she said. "Y-you t-tried..."
Ty-Shou grasped her wounded arms. He searched for her emotions.
/Fear/.
He tried again. He tried to think about what he felt in the vision Wo-Sa showed him of the Vareeshi in battle. Something more specific.
/Threatened./
Still, nothing. He looked at her face-- it was more peaceful. She was in pain, but any Fear, if it was there, had subsided.
/Satisfaction?/ /Relaxation?/
He kept searching. His emotional depth was wearing thin.
"Y-you h-helped h-him..."
She was here. While her nation was being attacked, falling apart, her brother murdered, she came here. She saw Ty-Shou's efforts, even though they were in vain. He heard of this before-- how he felt when the servants brought him his favorite food. When Wo-Sa took a break from the more serious or bookish lessons to teach him something like fishing.
/Gratitude./
Bright soft curves of Light flowed from Ty-Shou's fingertips and divided into thinner tendrils which mended Kitsai's wounds. Her smile widended, and her eyes fluttered to life.
"Synodontis," she said. She looked down at her arms, which were now as clean and smooth as newly sanded piece of wood. "You saved me."
"He did. Now back on your horse, Lady Kitsai", Ji-Xing said, as Kitsai straightened her long indigo dress.
Ty-Shou politely set Kitsai on her feet before turning over his shoulder and squinting at Ji-Xing. "Does it look like she came as a threat?"
"Scouts are always sent in the lowest number, and as inconspiciuously as possible," Qi-An said.
"I understand your suspiscion," Kitsai said as she gripped her horses' lead and pet his long, dark mane. "But I am not here to threaten you. I hoped for your healing, but had come to tell you that it was Anut who attacked my brother, attacked me, and have heard reports that my father is also dead, which he no doubt arranged. He has tried to take over, and trap the kings here until king making begins. He hopes to win everything in one fell swoop, and even though you aren't Vareeshi, I think you should leave before he tries to make good on that."
Ty-Shou felt a trust for Kitsai, but this time he looked to his two followers for their reaction.
"What proof do we have that the king is dead?" Ji-Xing asked.
"From your eyes, no proof. But would you not think he would be here by now? Is it not an unusual coincidence that the king's son and daughter, two and four on the pyramid, are attacked when the king is away and under threat?" Kitsai returned.
"That might makes sense, but your decisions up to this point don't. If all you saw was Synodontis Ty-Shou fail to help your brother, why would you assume that he could heal you?" Qi-An stepped in.
Ji-Xing side-eyed Qi-An again. Qi-An didn't seem to get the message. Ty-Shou didn't feel any Indigination, perhaps it was the recent warmth of saving Kitsai.
"It was a panicked situation. What mattered is that he tried to help," Kitsai said. "And if my logic is so flawed, why am I healed and standing right now?"
Ji-Xing nodded. The tough, square-bodied head of security turned back to Ty-Shou, his eyes soft in thought.
"I realize our incessant analysis may have come off as rude to your authority, my Synodontis," Ji-Xing said. "You know the facts. The decision is yours, my Synodontis."
Ty-Shou had mixed feelings about what Ji-Xing said-- being so young, Ty-Shou did feel it natural to listen to people's opinions and knowledge of the world and absorb like a child-- to have any authority to act on at all, he had to be informed enough to know what to do. However, he did find it unusual that Ji-Xing and Qi-An had been so talkative on this trip, especially since their official position was that of security guards. But this was an unprecedented situation-- Wo-Sa had told him about how to conduct himself if everything went right, not if everything turned to chaos. He looked to Kitsai for more.
"You should leave while you are able to Synodontis. Before king making begins," Kitsai stared into Ty-Shou's eyes. "You don't deserve to be caught up in a conflict you are not a part of."
Ironically, this brought up some emotion in Ty-Shou, and now he knew how to respond. "I am a part of every conflict. I introduce myself here as the Synodontis of Beisan to avoid confusion, but the Truth is, all people are my people. The Vareeshi will soon see the truth."
Kitsai laughed. Ty-Shou raised an eyebrow in confusion. "Well, I will take advice from your right hand and get on my horse and flee then. I don't want Anut's men catching me."
With a swift jump, Kitsai pulled herself upon her horse. "Thank you, Synodontis. May we meet again, if I am still around after king making."
"Wait." Ty-Shou commanded. "We are leaving the city as well. Perhaps you will be safer with our protection."
Kitsai turned. Her lips scrunched to one side of her face in consideration.
Ty-Shou took that as a yes. "Ji-Xing! Get the rest of the men ready and tell them only to pack necessities. We are leaving in secret after a short discussion in the compound."
Ji-Xing nodded. He, Ty-Shou, Ji-Xing, and Kitsai approached the gate and rung the bell. In a matter of seconds, the black wood gate was pulled open by a thin servant.
Kitsai gave an impressed smirk. "So what is your plan?"
Some of the Bei-Sanian men, dressed in their typical deep yellow thick tunics, were already running out of the buildings on the edges of the closed compound walls to join Ty-Shou's party. They made a straight line just as Ty-Shou stepped forward.
"My Light will guide me," the Synodontis said.

* Chapter 5
"My Synodontis, your sword," a thin squire clad in slightly oversized armor held out a sheathed sword, scurrying sideways in an awkward manner to hold it out as Synodontis walked alongside the garden squares in the courtyard of the compound. Ty-Shou took the sword-- it had a long, twisted black leather handle, with beautiful dark red wood peeking through the leather's snake-like wrap. The sheath was carved in the same wood as the base of the handle, with a long snake with detailed scales on it. At each quarter interval of the handle was an indent, wherein a brilliant rainbow crystal glowed. "I left it out the day so it could fill." The squire did a deep bow, and handed Synodontis the sword along with a cover for the handle, and Synodontis returned a gracious nod.
"Uhm, Synodontis," Kitsai walked alongside him. "Maybe your Light might guide you to listening to the educated daughter of the king of this city, who does have a plan?"
Synodontis rubbed the wooden sheathe of his sword and covered the handle before hilting it on his belt. "Go on."
"There's a secret passage to the old underground city, upon which Cong Lang was built," Kitsai motioned over the hills. "It's abandoned and difficult to access, and difficult to navigate in the dark, but that might be an advantage for us if we are patient."
Synodontis' eyes darted around as Qi-An pulled open the red engraved wood doors with a mighty tug of the large bronze ring doorknobs. He waited until the party entered under the central building's curved black clay tiled roof before continuing.
"I was inclined to try to end this peacefully. Even if what you say is true, and Anut has betrayed you, the other leaders are discontent and will join our side against his order. And with you on our side, we don't need to worry about the locals either."
"You might be right about the other leaders, but in terms of sheer number they are a minority here, and with Jakari dead, Anut has control of my father's pyramid now. And the monks have been saying king making could start any night now," Kitsai said. "The fact is, if we do not leave in secret, violence is likely unavoidable."
"I am not a coward. I can handle anything from the Vareeshi," Ty-Shou said. The main doors opened again, and a trio of servants bowed deeply before entering. Ty-Shou just gave a friendly nod.
"I do not mean to intrude nor correct you, My Synodontis," Ji-Xing said as the servants swarmed in and began gathering items. "But I thought you wanted this to end peacefully?"
Ty-Shou's lips pursed. "Well, I am equally surprised that you are suggesting we hear out her plan, as I thought you did not trust her."
"That is a good point, my Synodontis," Ji-Xing said.
"All ready," a short, bald servant reported to Ji-Xing and Ty-Shou as the other servants, holding small leather sacks over their shoulders, ran to hold open the door for the party.
"We need some time to discuss," Ty-Shou said to the servant. The servant nodded and left the compound.
"Ji-Xing is right," Ty-Shou said as he sat down on one of the square, detailed stools. "If we are leaving-- then our goal is to leave with the least conflict possible. But I believe we can do that by negotiating with the other leaders and the people of Cong Lang. They will see through Anut's lies, and you can reclaim your rightful place on the pyramid."
"It is too far gone. Anut has control now, and he is higher than me in the pyramid anyway," there was disdain in her voice. "I will start my own pyramid, and will be leaving tonight," Kitsai said. "If you do not wish to join me, that is your perogative." Synodontis harshly eyed Kitsai. Should he listen to her as an ally? His masculine instincts said, yes-- her face and posture were strong, but not too offensive to seem a threat; her prominent yet rounded cheeks and chin created a perfect mix of regality and trustworthiness. But reason wasn't as sure about what her true intentions was-- on the surface, her story was a possibility, but her long term goals? ""
"Men!" Ty-Shou turned to the group of a dozen men who had lined up between the small square gardens and ponds. A majority of them, like him, had the same striking silver hair, and less of them piercing silver eyes. "We are leaving the city when the sun fully sets. The mission is to stay quiet and protect and follow Lady Kitsai. Got it?"
The men-- some armored, some dressed in the yellow imperial servant tunics-- did the affirmtive Bei-Sanian salute in response: a clasping of the palms together and an aggressive thrust forward. Ji-Xing nodded to Ty-Shou. Ty-Shou looked up at the sky-- it was a swirled pastel of dark crimson and violet; the wispy clouds slithered like the snake on his sword.
"It should only be a matter of time."


The men mounted their horses as the carriage rolled up in front of the rooftop-spotted compound. Things were just getting too dark to see more than a few paces in front of oneself.
Ty-Shou stepped onto the carriages' step bar just as a cosmo of bright red stars lit up the town below the hill-- the Cong Langans were on alert.
Kitsai got on her horse and walked it off the road towards the hill which she had come from-- she was already ahead of the problems that Ty-Shou was just spotting.
"We need to ride off the main roads, and without light," she said. "It's the only way to not be spotted."
The carriage driver turned to Ty-Shou for orders. Ty-Shou sighed.
"We will commission a greater one once we return to Bei-San," Ji-Xing said.
Synodontis looked again at the golden outline of him wrangling the dragon on the side of the carriage door. "Yes. We must," he said.
The carriage driver placed a small stone in front of the front wheel of the carriage and then unhitched the two horses. He lead them both forward for Ty-Shou and Ji-Xing get on.
"I'm sorry, my Synodontis," the carriage driver motioned to the dismounted cart. "She was a beauty. I'll miss driving her too."
The carriage drive turned and gave a Bei-Sanian salute to the carriage. Ty-Shou nodded and smiled.
Qi-An stood still, the only one not mounted, like a confused child staring up at a group of adults. "Come on, Qi-An," Ji-Xing slapped the back of his horses' saddle. "Are you too insecure to ride lady-style?"
Without a word, Qi-An awkwardly lifted himself onto the back of the saddle with Ji-Xing's help.
Kitsai rode ahead, but still saying close enough that even in the utter darkness the rest of the group could see the back of her horse, and definitely could hear its hoofsteps. "Stay together," she whispered to the group. "A light will attract attention. I'll move slowly, but follow my footsteps."
Ty-Shou was simultaneously impressed, offended, and though he also had auxillary negative feelings to the fact he felt this feeling-- a bit attracted-- to the fact that Kitsai had so quickly taken charge so soon after coming to him in desperation. But now was not the time to squabble about these things or work out complex feelings.
The shape of the hill now was hardly visible, and the little bumps and dips felt like jumps and drops when Ty-Shou didn't expect them. /Maybe it's time to become a better rider/.
"How do you know we're going the right direction?" Ty-Shou hissed towards the back of a horse he thought was Kitsai.
It took a little longer than expected for Kitsai to respond, and Ty-Shou almost opened his mouth again to ask the same question towards the sound of another horse.
"Growing up as a little girl with everything scheduled for her, but who just wanted to be free outside, I learned how these hills felt in the dark. Well, not perfectly, I usually didn't go out when it was this late. But I can tell where everything is by where the other torches are."
Ty-Shou looked around. Off in the distance, little balls of light moved like overgrown fireflies that could only move right or left.
They kept on quite the same for a bit. Though the ride was rather slow and quiet, it felt a bit nerve-wracking, constantly listening in the darkness for the group of hoofsteps. As they got closer to a line where the bright balls would cross, Kitsai said, "Stop."
One by one, the soft patter of the horses' hooves on grass united into silence, until all that could be heard were crickets and a frog.
"We don't want to get spotted. On my mark, take off," Kitsai said. "Go a bit faster when crossing the line of torches, but follow the pace of the sounds ahead of you. It'd be a disaster if we bump into each other."
Around eighty paces ahead, five torches walked from left to right. Four torches was coming the other direction. After the five crossed the four, there was an opening behind each of them.
"Go!"
One by one, the patter of the horses started up again. Ty-Shou was fourth in line, behind Kitsai, Ji-Xing, and two other guards. Kitsai's horse crossed the line just as the two crossing torches were about thirty paces from the crossing point. However, on the side where the group of four torches was on, a couple of torches emerged from the darkness-- likely from behind a building, and started walking the opposite direction-- towards the crossing point.
The couple of torches and the four torches both stopped when they intersected, just as Ty-Shou's horse crossed the road. He could hear muttering from their direction.
The four torches started moving again in the same direction. Soon after, the couple of torches continued on.
The last horses in Ty-Shou's party sprinted across the road. After they had completely escaped back into the hilly darkness, Kitsai and the rest of the group had begun to slow their roll.
"Shit! We've been spotted!" Ji-Xing said.
Ty-Shou turned his head. The couple of torches had turned to follow them.
"Just stay calm. And stay still," Kitsai said. "We don't want to attract any more attention."
"Hey!" Someone shouted in the distance, still only visible as the torches, which kept approaching.
They got closer until the party could hear the footsteps of their horses, as well as see the group-- it was a group of only four horses.
"We aren't Bei-Sanians. We're from Vang Do, and we mean no harm," a matronly, somewhat chubby yet quite beautiful middle-aged woman spoke from under the light of the torch.
Still, nobody moved. The torch kept coming closer until their horses were touching noses.
"My name is Maleesh. We know you're trying to get out of here, and we want in," the woman spoke again.
"We would we help you when you're just drawing more attention? Do you think we're riding in the dark for no reason?" Kitsai hissed.
"Because if you don't I'm just going to draw even more," Maleesh said.
"Fine, we'll help you! Just snuff out that light already!" Kitsai hissed.
Maleesh looked to the other torch bearer before they both complied. Once again, the party was talking in darkness.
Ty-Shou squirmed in his saddle as Kitsai again speaking as leader of the group. It was time for him to take charge.
"How did you spot us?" he asked. "And let's get moving again. They might come to invesetigate why two torches went out on the middle of the hillside. Men! We're moving out!"
"We saw you leaving your compound earlier," Maleesh turned to Ty-Shou as he moved his horse into a trot. "When we saw that you left your carriage behind, we knew something was up. We tried to follow, but got lost, I hate to admit it but it was luck that you were crossing this main road when we were on it. We are not trackers or hunters by trade," Maleesh laughed. "Any how, what is your plan?"
Ty-Shou spoke quickly before Kitsai could interject. "There's an abandoned underground city that Cong Lang was built over, which connects to the outer plains."
"And how far is it?" Maleesh asked.
This time, Ty-Shou couldn't comment. "We're actually almost there," Kitsai replied. "Now just stay quiet until I give the word."
Even though he knew that Kitsai was talking to Maleesh, this time he felt her tone really get on his nerves. His fist clenched and felt rage pump through his veins. But he only had a bit of Light left-- the Light stored in his sword-- not to mention that it would be an embarrasment to erupt in front of his men, or harm his ally. He pushed it down.
They moved on for what felt like a long time as the focus required to move in the dark and push down the fear was quite draining, especially as the hill became a steep downhill. Finally, Kitsai spoke.
"It should be around here," Kitsai lit a torch, illuminating a less lush and trimmed area then their previous surroundings, full of sickly trees and yellowish grass. Ty-Shou jumped in his saddle. Frankly, they had been riding in the dark so long that the spark was a shock. Kitsai waved the torch around the area while turning with her horse. They trotted in zig-zags for a bit until Kitsai found a natural rocky wall that intersected with the hilly terrain.  Ty-Shou guarded his eyes preemptively at the squeaking bats which seemed to shoot out of the rocks.
"Yes!" Kitsai shouted. Ty-Shou followed the ball of light which faded in between the rock face ahead. The group squeezed into the cave entrance. Two of Ty-Shou's guards lit torches of their own.
The cave immeadiately widened. As they went a bit deeper, Kitsai's light shined on two smooth stone pillars three times as wide as tree trunks.
"Rivers! There's guards," Kitsai said. She tried to hide her light behind one of he pillars, but it was too late.
"We can't leave now," Ty-Shou hissed. "We'll have to get past them eventually."
"Maybe they're like us?" Maleesh said.
"Why are they coming this direction, then?" Kitsai rebutted. "There's not too many of them. This is the only shot we got. I'll lead and try to negotiate," she whipped her horse back into a trot and turned around the pillar.
"Come on," Ty-Shou said back to the rest of the party. He rode five paces behind Kitsai. Ji-Xing and Qi-An rode next to him, and the rest rode in a blob behind them. As they passed the pillars, the
"Who goes there?" one of the group shouted. He held a torch himself. As they got closer, it was clear that they were Cong Lang guards, outfitted in the thick indigo with teal outlines.
"Kitsai, Third in Pyramid of Cong Lang, after the tragic death of my brother," Kitsai stood up straight and raised her torch to her face.
"Lady Kitsai. You know that there's a city-wide lockdown. What are you doing down here with these--" the guard leaned his head to look at the rest of the party, "foreigners."
"Well, as a High Superior, I command you to let us pass," Kitsai said.
The guards two guards holding torches looked to each other. Ty-Shou glanced between them, pulling the cloth cover off his sword's handle. Ji-Xing gripped the steel ingot in his back pocket. One guard nodded to the other.
"Of course, as per your command, Lady Kitsai," the first torchbearer said. The two guards, and the sixteen or so behind them, split to let the party passs through.
Kitsai gave the guards a small nod. She whipped her horse into a slow trot through the hall. The rest of the party manuevered to form a straight line. But as Kitsai crossed the two torchbearers, she spotted something among the men behind them that made her jump.
:comment:
maybe Kitsai is too stupid for even passing through without making the guards move more. (I originally wrote this scene like it's one big hallway.)
:END:
"It's a trap!"
Before she could even finish the sentence, one of the torch bearers charged his horse right at the party. Ji-Xing dodged the thrust. Kib-Si wasn't so lucky. The spear impaled the carriage driver like a knife through a tomato, splattering innards out the new opening.
"Kib-Si!" Ty-Shou shouted. His heart squeezed and shrank. Ty-Shou was fond of all his people, and had enjoyed talking to the driver on the ride here.
Ty-Shou unsheathed his sword and sliced right at the guard. The guard blocked with an armored gauntlet. Sparks flew. Ty-Shou's sword richocheted back. The guard yelled.
Two guards stabbed at Kitsai. Kitsai soumersaulted off her horse as the spears crossed over her saddle. Her horse squealed and ran through the guards in panic.
Kitsai stood determined like a small coyote against a pack of wolves. The much taller mounted guards closed the hall through which her horse ran through. One guard, a woman unexpectedly old and frail, rotated both her hands and flexed her fingers at the ground. Directly where her hands were pointing, a swirling, violet form the height of one of the mounted men but with crab-like legs and a praying mantis body raised itself out from the ground. Its arms started thick and pointed outwards, and divided into four sharp tendrils each, which were themselves about the length of a normal human arm. A threatening Creation.
The Creation swept its tendrils at Kitsai. Each finger spread to maximize the time and reach of the sweep attack. Kitsai backflipped back to avoid the attack. The Creation closed in. A large Bei-Sanian guard shielded Kitsai.
:comment:
creation used here
:END:
The Creation's left tendrils spread and lurched at the lumbering Bei-Sanian guard. He confidently smashed away two of them with his shield, and slashed one with his spear. The tendrils flashed white when hit, but didn't seem to be misshapen from the attack.
Ji-Xing fled with Qi-An in an opposite direction, into the darkness, to put more distance between him and the attackers. "Give me time to harden!" he told Qi-An.
From the stone ring on Ji-Xing's hand grew a layer of stone that covered his skin, moving from his arm to his torso. An enemy rider noticed this and charged at the mounted pair. Qi-An threw a quill the size of a pencil. It /flew/ like a geyser. Faster than the eye could track, it pierced the arm brace of the charging man. He howled and dropped his sword.
Maleesh and her three guards, already in the back of the caravan, retreated further from the battle, leaving the rest of the Beisanians in darkness. However, the guards and servants alike charged in anyway against the greater numbers.
The large Bei-Sanian guard threw his shoulder to stab at the Creation. The Creation's front leg flashed white, and its form noticeably collapsed to one side.
"Low!" the old woman shouted at her Creation. The Creation lowered its arms and swept at the horses' chest. The horse whinnied in pain, and raised its front legs in defense. The rider's back smashed against the rock wall. A Cong Lang rider moved in and stabbed a spear through his eye.
Ty-Shou saw the killing out the corner of his eye and grit his teeth. Indignation flared in his chest-- he pressed it down. The enemy guard thrust his spear. Ty-Shou dodged and sliced off its head.
He caught the tip of the spear in his off hand. Indignation moved from his chest to consume the spear tip with a hot glow. The enemy guard's shocked face twisted from his cut spear to the glowing red tip. Ty-Shou chucked it over the Creation to the back line of guards. It landed on a guards' chest. His neck and jaw blew to pieces.
Ty-Shou didn't waste a second to stab his flabbergasted opponent right through the neck. The guard's body and decapitated spear slumped off his horse. Ty-Shou moved back into the Light provided by his guards' torches-- he had used all the Light in his sword.
Another trio, unmounted, focused on Qi-An and Ji-Xing. Two large shields stood in front converged to shield the third. Two discs floated from his hand into the air-- A Space Herald. The discs spun at Qi-An and Ji-Xing. Qi-An squinted and aimed a quill at the disc. It shot right at it, but the Space Herald piloted it away. Qi-An panicked and grabbed another quill from his off-hand. He chucked it. It missed. He scrambled for another.
Ty-Shou saw the disc fly towards his friends. He jumped off his horse. Enough people had died today-- enough Bei-Sanians, his people, his responsiblity to protect. Another emotion flared in his body-- Determination mixing with responsibility, and even a hint of Love-- Passion.
His muscles pulsed with power. He lept forward like a cheetah, faster and farther than what was humanly possible. His guards' torch blew out-- he sucked the power from it-- and mid-jump he was cast in Darkness-- but so was the Space Herald.
Ty-Shou slashed his sword right through one of the discs. A half-moon of each fell to the ground. He swiped back for the other disc, but in the Darkness, he missed.
Qi-An could barely make out the area with the Light from Maleesh's party's torches far behind him, and the enemy's torches ahead. The disc came out of the Dark, paces away from him. In desperation, he threw all the quills in his hand at it-- it dodged. An arms length away, it shot right for his neck--
*CRUNCH!* The disk smashed into pieces. Ji-Xing drew his fist back from the successful punch.
"Good lad," Ji-Xing smirked at Qi-An. All his skin was stone except his forehead now. "Next time remind me to stone up earlier."
Qi-An nodded and breated a sigh of relief.
Kitsai's chest pumped up and down. She ran. The rocks crunched behind her. Her knee smashed against something hard, and she nearly screamed in agony. She felt ahead-- it was a wall of some sort.
She had blundered coming into the Darkness-- the Creation didn't need Light to see her, but she needed Light to see it. She spun her head in the Darkness, searching desperately for a Light source. The crunching came closer. The Light was now a smaller ball, making a sillhouette out of a few men on horses.
She pushed her back against the wall she had run into, sliding herself away from the crunching at a fast speed, and towards the Light. She gritted through the pain in her knee. The crunching sped up, and she took a chance and ran for the Light.
Three more mounted soldiers rushed at Ty-Shou and the guards.
"AAA!!" Out from the Dark, a stone-skinned Ji-Xing leaped onto a soldier's horse. He knocked him off. The horse wailed. The man screamed as he was trampled by his neighbor's horse, who also shrieked, and tripped, sliding onto the rock floor.
The other riders turned to Ji-Xing. One stabbed at him, but his spear cracked against the warrior's skin. Ji-Xing pulled the broken spear, and sent the man flying off his horse. He *smashed* the man in the face, decimating it.
The floating daggers came at Ty-Shou. They threatened to stab at his neck, he held his sword just in front of his nose, preparing to slice them. One whipped left-- Ty-Shou swung, and it dodged, avoiding his attack but moving away from his body. It slid past him and focused on his servants. Ty-Shou charged at the shieldbearers protecting the Space Herald. He sliced at the bearer's arm, but the bearer parried with his shield. The daggers moved with less grace and speed than the discs, but it was enough to fly past the servant's arms-- and cut their throats.
Ty-Shou felt fear, and rage, building in his sweat. He tried to turn it into something that could help him-- Suspiscion would let him see in the dark but leave his attackers blinded-- but he couldn't, the emotion was too volatile, too desperate, and he wasn't used enough to channeling Suspiscion. He screamed and threw his weight behind his sword, but it was no use.
Ji-Xing saw the knives move from the servant's neck's to Ty-Shou's guards. He knew Ty-Shou would be in trouble soon. He whipped the horse into a sprint, but was blocked by the last rider.
The rider raised his shield at Ji-Xing. Ji-Xing slammed his horse into the rider's', and tackled the rider to the ground. He smashed the screaming man's skull in and used his body as a cushion against the rocks.
"Get him! Only Oskavi can kill him, we need to stall!" One of the guards pointed to Ji-Xing. A group of four guards advanced and formed a defensive diamond between Ji-Xing and Ty-Shou.
"You really don't learn from your eyes," Ji-Xing said. He slammed his rock-hard knuckles against his palm.
The Beisanian guards made themselves small and held their shields close to their necks. The dagger tried to loop around the guards-- one hit it with his shield. The Space Herald lost control, and it fell to the ground. The other guard ended up with a bloody throat. The guard raised his shield and Ty-Shou stepped in to slash his sword at the dagger.
"SYNODONTIS!" the guard shouted.
Ty-Shou turned to see the fallen dagger rising from the ground. He slapped it with his sword, sending it clattering into the Dark.
He spun back around again-- to hear the broken throat clears of a guard with a dagger in his neck. The second the guard had taken a second he needed to defend himself to warn his god.
Ty-Shou screamed.
:missing:
ty-shou uses powerlessness or some other sadness to escape here. don't know what it is yet.
:END:
Ji-Xing saw the knife turn in the air, dressed with dripping blood spin back towards Ty-Shou. He was still several paces away and blocked by four guards. Spears aimed for his eyes. He swatted them away. The horses tried to move backward. He jumped and smashed one of the guards in the kneecap. He pulled another down from the leg and uppercutted his stomach, puncturing his inner organs and reaching past the other side of his back. He pushed the disemboweled guard off his arm.
Even against one floating dagger, Ty-Shou's sword was far too thin to effectively block it. He tried to lunge for the fallen guards' shield, but the Herald was too smart, and used the dagger to dominate the space. With one dagger, he played a lot slower, biding his time to wait for the perfect opportunity to slice Ty-Shou's neck.
The last guard realized his fate and retreated to just place himself between Ji-Xing and his Ji-Xing ran after him, but he just created space-- until a rock came /flying/ at the guard so hard, he fell off his mount. Ji-Xing didn't have time to look back and thank Qi-An. He just kicked the guard in the stomach and moved on.
Ty-Shou stumbled backwards. His heart shook his whole being. There was no light large or close enough for him to grab. He only make out a tiny speck of orange light on the dagger. The knife moved in on him.
Xi-Jing ran towards Ty-Shou, entering the darkness. However, his eyes found a shape-- something was there-- something dark, but massive...
The Creation. For the first time, it opened its mouth, with a row of teeth so long that it made a shark look like a squirrel, and ROARED.
If his stone skin could still make goosebumps, it would. The literally hardened warrior felt fear for the first time in decades.
He tried to move to the left. The monster blocked him. It slashed at him-- and unlike the spears and swords, he FELT this one. He grasped his stone arm in pain.
But though people thought he was muscle, it was Ji-Xing's memory that never failed him.  He remembered what his first drill sergeant had screamed in his face the first time he froze up.
/You feel the FEAR. CHARGE THROUGH IT!/
With a war cry, Ji-Xing raised his shoulder and TACKLED the monster. Its whole front lit up white. It scurried backwards on its hind legs, trying to maintain balance, getting pushed back farther and farther by Ji-Xing. In vain, it stabbed at Ji-Xing, but it's arms weren't able to reach right in front of its chest.
Ji-Xing remembered something else that drill sergeant told him when he was put on archery as a punishment.
/ALWAYS AIM FOR THE BIGGER TARGET./
He twisted his elbow and turned his charge towards the Space Herald and his shieldbearers. The shield bearers positioned to defend the Space Herald.
The back of the Creation broke through the shield bearers. Its crab legs trampled them. The Space Herald dodged and whipped his wrist--
The dagger THRUST at Ty-Shou. Ty-Shou ducked. He could only feel the emotions, and the true fear of having no way to channel them into power. Of being turned from a god into a helpless child.
Ji-Xing uppercutted the Creation, sending it flying on its back. The Space Herald motioned with his wrist, but turned his focus to Ji-Xing.
The dagger slammed down. Ty-Shou scrambled onto his back. The Vareeshi fighter's memory of death he experienced felt like a joke now-- it was as real as any day, but that little part of the brain that knows something is fake goes a long way. Here, in the Darkness, there was no Hope. There was nothing but void waiting for him.
The Space Herald ran. Ji-Xing lunged forward.
The dagger sped for his neck. Ty-Shou didn't move in time, and only thrust backwards.
Ji-Xing gripped the Space Herald by the back of the neck.
The dagger's tip hit Ty-Shou's neck.
Ji-Xing SQUEEZED.
The dagger fell. The flat long side landed onto Ty-Shou's belly.
A demonic swallow came from the Space Herald's mouth. His body collapsed. His head still stayed on the spine, but tilted, with an hourglass-like dent in his neck.
A blood red line came to life on Ty-Shou's neck.
Ty-Shou sat up.
No blood dripped from it. A superficial scratch.
All the guards were dead, except the elderly Creation Herald, who Kitsai pointed a sharp sword at. The woman raised her hands in surrender.
With a shaky hand, Ty-Shou picked up the dagger off his belly, and blew out a huge exhale.
Ji-Xing picked up one of the fallen guards' torches. His skin gradually faded from stone grey to brownish yellow. The group regrouped around Kitsai and the Creation Herald.
"I surrender to you, Lady Kitsai," the old woman knelt. "I am not high in your pyramid, nor have I ever been high in any pyramid, and neither has my family. Please let me live for this king making."
"Today is your lucky day," Kitsai said and lifted the woman's chin. "I have just founded my new pyramid, today. You can be my Second."
The woman gave a creased smile and a nod.
"You should fix your Creation, to make it's arms able to reach directly in front of it," Qi-An said as he knelt down to check the pulse of one of the guards. "So someone as bold as Ji-Xing can't just beat it by charging like that."
Ji-Xing smiled and patted his prodigy on the back. "It's scary enough already," he said.
"Mal-EESH!" Kitsai shouted, cupping her hands on her lips. The shout echoed through the entire cave. "We won!"
There was a pause, and then the clapping of hooves slowly got closer as the torches approached, their echoes doubling and tripling through the expanding cave.
As they got close enough so their torches' light met with Ji-Xing's, Maleesh gave a kind smile, but it came off as forced.
"You didn't fight at all," Qi-An said, but his tone was not accusatory.
"Of course," Kitsai said as she picked up the shield of a fallen guard. "You Vang Doans are degenerates."
"It's not king making yet," Maleesh raised her chin defensively. "Not only are we not obliged, isn't it dishonorable to attack an opposing pyramid beforehand?"
Kitsai spit toward Maleesh. "We were fighting for our lives. And like you cowards plan to do anything this king making."
"We are still Vareeshi," Maleesh said, her words ignoring the spit but her expression clearly acknowledging in. "Strict fundamentalists like Khua and backwards animals like Hysho will get nowhere in the coming world. I thought you Cong Langans were smarter."
"You choose not to fight and to work with the rest of the world because it is easy," Kitsai said. "That is the definition of dishonor, and against all Vareeshi."
"Vareeshi or not, even the simplest barbarians would consider what you did a slimy act of cowardice," Ty-Shou said. "You owe us your life, and especially the innocent Bei-Sanians who were slain due to your cowardice."
Ty-Shou's heart was still pounding, and he poured the energy into his words. Now he feared truly death-- but could a god like him even die?  Perhaps that was the very reason he feared it-- the fear that if he did die, it would prove he was not one. That all the legends he was told about himself was a big lie.
:comment:
is this too obvious foreshadowing?
:END:
"We did not kill them. But the rest-- is fair," Maleesh's lips tightened. "And you will see that Vang Doans DO have honor and repay quite generously."
"Cowardice and actions not meeting words are too traits that go hand in hand," Ty-Shou returned. "I hope you defy the norms."
Maleesh just smiled awkwardly again.
"You mean, dishonesty?" Kitsai raised an eyebrow. Ty-Shou said nothing, but inside, he facepalmed. Though his grasp of language had been quite good, sometimes, he said phrases that sounded odd to everyone.
"The battle is over," Ji-Xing said. "What's important is that we get out of here as fast as possible, before reinforcements arrive."
"Agreed," Kitsai said. She turned to face deeper into the cave.
"Or worse, before king making begins."

* Chapter VI
:comment:
perhaps add ty-shou being scared at night, everyone being scared at night and on guard in case anut would send a party
:END:

Ty-Shou weaved like an excited child from the Vang Doan guards' side to the middle of the party, where Kitsai huddled with her new recruits. Ty-Shou remembered Wo-Sa's voice. /I know you're excited, but you must always maintain a regal posture./ He slowed his roll and straightened his face as he approached a group of tall armored men.
Kitsai had picked up quite a mass of followers along the littering rural towns of Cong Lang past the other side of the abandoned underground town. They did not wear coloured, numbered necklaces like the rest of the Vareeshi yet, but Kitsai said she would get some as soon as she made her big move, and already an informal hierarchy was starting to form. The old Dark Herald had moved down pretty far from second, but she was happy all the same.
They had reached an dense forest that had begun just outside the open hills of Cong Lang, following the wide river that headed West, and had entered a thick, cold forest that housed even wetter, colder swamps. Their clothes embodied the environment now, too. Delicate patterns woven over wispy white dresses, meant to create a semi-transparent effect to evoke an ethereal beauty, had been ruined by a stain of thick mud. Colorful cultural threads that had been layered and relayered to pop more than anything in the natural world had been sucked dry by the rain. Everyone had regretted bringing their best to the palace.
Still spirits were up. They had reached another pyramid, as per Kitsai's plan, who had agreed to let stay and escort them to their leader to negotiate with. It was getting late, and the former daughter of Cong Lang was scanning the sky again. The sun was setting, and the large moon was hidden behind the clouds. She still stared at it, as always.
"It's getting closer," she said, same as the past few nights since they had left Cong Lang. "The monks said it would start this week."
The couple Ty-Shou had come up next to noticed him and smiled. Ty-Shou bowed his head.
"Hello," he said. "I did not get a chance to meet you yet since you joined us. My name is Synodontis Ty-Shou Xing of Bei-San." Though he wasn't confident about his vocubulary in Vareeshi, Ty-Shou spoke the words proudly.
"We are Caman and Jusill of...," they looked to each other, and then at Kitsai. "Kitsai? Now, I guess so."
Ty-Shou chuckled and they did as well. "Yes, new startings are exciting. But I am more excited by everyone's whole story. Where did you come from? Even before Cong Lang."
"We actually used to be from around this area," the plump woman said. "We were part of Tesaak pyramid before last king making."
"They will let us sleep in their twon, yes?"  Maleesh interrupted, speaking at Kitsai. She had come up behind the group, still on horseback.
Both Kitsai and Ty-Shou turned to glare at Maleesh. "Your impatience is coincedental," Kitsai said. "We are on our way to Tesaak's manor, in fact.
"Before I was interrupted," Ty-Shou grumbled, "Who is this Teesak?"
"Tesaak was my father's prime enemy in the region before last king making-- we really cut him down to size," Kitsai said. "Probably a good two-fifths of all Cong Lang is made up of former Tesaak."
Ty-Shou knew, but didn't understand, the ever-changing loyalties of the Vareeshi. Ever since he was reincarnated, Ty-Shou had been told one truth about his origin, his people, his land, and who he was. The Bei-Sanian people had problems, but they were one people together, who did not change: if there was a problem about his people, it wok pyramid before last king making."
"Oh no. I hope he didn't take your conquest too personally. I do not want to find a place to sleep outside again," Maleesh groaned.
He looked around the forest-swamp for where they even /could/ find a place to sleep. Though it was dark, Ty-Shou could see the similarity between Tesaak's houses' and the Cong Langs; they also featured the steep clay tile roofs except they were at an even steeper, though their designs, as did the whole town, blended into the forest; they were made with the same sharp shapes, but as natural in pallete as tree houses. Both the houses and the paths were shaded by trees and foliage, unlike the Cong Lang who seemed to clear the entire area to appear like just palaces on a hill under the sun. Ty-Shou wasn't used to so much green; he had spent the last three years on the rocky coastal hill of the Bei-San palace.
The road turned into an outdoor gate, and the guards had anyone with a horse mount them to the fence before they proceeded inside.  The party plodded through a field filled with sheep and goats. Here they looked much more docile and domestic than the crazy mountain goat Ty-Shou occassionally saw when training on the rocky coast. A massive hay mat, covered with mud, lay on the front steps before a stone staircase that led up to a square palace with a pyramidal black roof with several wood pillars stretching the horizontal length beneath it. The guards brushed their feet off in an obviously illustrative manner before walking up the steps and knocking on the large stone door. A bald man answered the door with a candle in hand as the party wiped their shoes and trickled up the steps. The bald man whispered to the guards, left, and closed the door before returning shortly after. Ty-Shou couldn't make out what they were saying, but he knew the master of the house wouldn't speak like that. Before the servant could speak again, heavy footsteps banged from within.
"What is it at this hour!? It's not king making, is it?" A man with a different accent than the Cong Langers said. He opened the door, and his expression took a second to go from irritable to a smile. "Oh, guests!"
The man had a thick, black, straight, hair, eyebrows, and mustache. Though his hair was still black, his skin was wrinkled and his eyes weary. His frame filled the door and gave the room a serious, but not scary, air.
Lady Kitsai bowed, and the rest of her pyramid bowed after her, though some were delayed. "Lord Tesaak. I, Lady Kitsai, request to discuss some important matters and to stay with you for a night."
"Lady Kitsai. I am pleased to meet you face to face, but I must admit this is quite unusual timing," Tesaak smiled.
"I apologize for the disruption," Kitsai said. "If you can't tell from our condition, we would not have come if we had any other option."
Tesaak laughed as he used his hand to sweep some dust and food into his hand. "Your stay might not be as luxurious as you expected. I had to permanently move to a smaller manor after my former one was destroyed near the end of king making by Cong Lang," there was a hint of disdain in Tesaak's voice.
"Then you'll be happy to know I am no longer a part of Cong Lang," Kitsai said. "I hate to inconvenience you, but do you possibly have some room for the rest of my party?"
"We'll get you all settled. My pyramidmen are very hospitable. There should be several houses able to host a guest or two," Tesaak turned to the servants and the guards.
"Lord Tesaak was always a gracious leader," Caman said to Ty-Shou. Jusill nodded.
The guards and servants led some most of the party back outside the manor and into the town. Tesaak himself welcomed Ty-Shou, Ji-Xing, Qi-An, Kitsai, Maleesh and one of her guards into his home.
"Unfortunately you'll have to share rooms. You look hungry, I can have the servants prepare you something when they get back," Tesaak said as he led them into the living room. Not much was visible beside the planks illuminated by Tesaak's candle, but the smell of warm, raw wood reminded Ty-Shou of spring, even though it was closer to fall.
"Thank you, Lord Tesaak," Kitsai and Ty-Shou said in unison. "Your hospitality is greatly appreciated," Maleesh said.
"The rooms are upstairs. I'll lead you to them. Let's save the negotiations for tomorrow. We are all exhausted," Tesaak said.
Kitsai looked to Ty-Shou and nodded. "Agreed."
Tesaak did just that. He strode around his own house, up the stairs, down the stairs, holding his candle with one hand like it was an explorer's torch. He was determined, but high-strung, almost anxious, in his voice and movements. In the end many had a small rice bowl and mushroom soup delivered to their rooms. Part of Ty-Shou's heart wanted to share a room with Kitsai, but he decided against it and bunked with Ji-Xing and Qi-An. He had never shared a room with a woman-- well, he had never shared a room with anybody, but he had never even shared a /building/ with a woman-- and this felt like an awkward time to start. Both Ji-Xing and Qi-An had collapsed with a wool blanket tucked over them into a heavy snore. Ty-Shou's eyes stayed wide in the dark room, his feet hitting the bamboo frame of the bed. His mind bounced between the unanswered questions-- /Was Kitsai to be trusted? Did she like him? Was it really Anut who did this attack? What would Wo-Sa say about these events? Would Bei-San survive this king making?/ Eventually, the whirlwind of thoughts drifted into mindless, broken ones, softened and suppressed by the Darkness.


Many slept an ample time, almost double a normal day's rest, as they had pushed through the night days before and exhausted themselves to gain a lead on Anut's pursuing forces. Ty-Shou was one of the last to wake up. Qi-An and Ji-Xing were already ready and had been standing guard outside the bedroom.
After taking a cold bath, Ty-Shou made his way downstairs with Qi-An and Ji-Xing in tow. The kitchen and dining room, like the rest of the city, looked quite natural yet also diverse, red, brown, and black woods were used for different furniture and accenting.
Kitsai had already taken a seat at the circular table under a skylight and sipped from a stone tea set across from Tesaak.
"You discount change, Tesaak. In Revenge Winter, everyone thought Tan would take all of Central Marthia. One king making later, and no one even spoke their name," Kitsai said.
"That's true, and exactly my point. Large pyramids fall. Small pyramids rise. But it is truly rare that a large pyramid is truly crushed and then gets near its prior height again," Tesaak said in between sips.
"Yaozen. Khua," Kitsai replied, still focused on their argument even as Ty-Shou took as a seat.
"Khua is the oldest dynasty left standing. They didn't have a meteoric rise, get crushed, and then rise again. They just had a few small setbacks," Tesaak said. He gave Ty-Shou a welcoming nod.
"So what is your point? You're just going to sit here in your little cabin waiting until Cong Lang, or Bisek, or even Khua, subjects you and your people?"
"Of course not. My duty as a king goes beyond my own controversial analysis," Tesaak said. "I will fight to the death for my pyramid and my heaven. But the reality is, yes, I am trapped between larger powers."
"Excuse me for interrupting," Ty-Shou said, his voice still groggy. "But I believe that is exactly why Lady Kitsai is here, and what she is saying. Without an ally like her, and without leaving this place, you are dead. And it seems that tragically you agree on this matter."
Tesaak nodded. The man seemed oddly nonchalant about his incoming doom. "Perhaps an alliance would not be a terrible idea," Tesaak said. "I need all the help I can get."
Kitsai sipped her tea. She gave a subtle smile to Ty-Shou.
"But you!" Tesaak laughed and hit Ty-Shou on the shoulder. "I'm more curious about you. Why are you here? What are you doing with us Vareeshi?"
Ty-Shou's throat ached for tea. He motioned to the kettle in question. Tesaak nodded and pushed a teacup towards the Synodontis. Ty-Shou took a sip before answering.
"We were all invited to Cong Lang for the coalition ball," Ty-Shou said. "As you may know."
"I am not familiar with coalition politics," Tesaak replied. "Even when my pyramid was large enough that they were pestering me, I always shooed them off."
"Well you must know that Delrai and Bei-San are members despite not being Vareeshi. Anyhow, unfortunately King Mangsi was called to deal with a Kaihan raiding party. Anut, who I believe was third in Cong Lang, poisioned Jakari at the ball, and attacked Kitsai," Ty-Shou continued. "King Mangsi's whereabouts are unknown, but Kitsai believes his death was orchestrated by Anut. The whole city was locked down because of the poisoning, which was a ploy to keep the leaders trapped until they could be slaughtered at king making."
Tesaak sighed. "A dishonorable but effective power grab. This is why I never paid much attention to that coalition nonsense. I knew it would cause chaos if it ever intersected with king making."
Kitsai slammed her fist against her palm. "I'm gonna kill that bastard for what he did. And you can finally take revenge on Cong Lang if you join me. How many people do you have? Two thousand?"
"More than /that./ The forest hides our buildings and our people. It's true, we are no where near the million strong we used to be. But there are a good eight thousand loyal to me in these trees. I don't even have the biggest house!" Tesaak laughed.
"Excellent," Kitsai said. "Then we'll have enough to raid the even smaller pyramids and fight off Anut on the edge of Cong Lang."
"Give me some time to think on it," Tesaak said. "I may have been one of the kings with the most people under him, once, but that was over a decade ago. It's been a long time since I've had to make big alliance decisions like this."
"Don't think too long. King making is upon us," Kitsai warned.
"Your offer was to make my pyramid subject to yours, was it not?" Tesaak asked.
"Yes. The Cong Lang higher ups will only listen to me, and that is where a majority of our reinforcements will come from," Kitsai said.
"Then I need some time alone and with those I trust to make a decision like this. Go out on the town and relax for a day. The forest is beautiful and the people are too," Tesaak said.
Tesaak stood to his feet and stretched. Kitsai and Ty-Shou tucked in their chairs and bowed.


The cook gave a hearty smile that was almost more charming and innocent due to his several missing teeth. He handed the meat stick to Ty-Shou, and Ty-Shou eyed it for a while-- it looked a bit rare-- before taking a bite. His eyes lit up.
"Mmmm! This is good! Try it!" Ty-Shou bit down again before holding out the end of the meat stick to Kitsai. Kitsai took a bite and chewed for a while before making a cheekful smile.
Many of the locals and Kitsai's new pyramid were dancing and relaxing in the town square. Meats and other local plates were handed out, some cooks asked for coins, other didn't. Men wearing masks of different wood colors, the same ones apparent in Tesaaks' lodge, danced in structured patterns and lines. Drums and shaking instruments gave some rhythym to the circle.
Ty-Shou lightly swung to the beat, but he kept glancing up at the treeline. Though he still felt Light seep into his body, he didn't feel natural with the sun above him.
"One thing I don't understand. You all have your own music, art, clothes, the same as us Bei-Sanians. How do you Vareeshi actually /do/ king making? Fight every time the moons align to the death. Doesn't it make your lives feel-- chaotic, insecure?" Ty-Shou asked.
"Just the opposite," Kitsai immediately snapped back. "We know that this life means little-- even our art is mostly a pass time. This is merely a test for the heaven to come. We know exactly what we need to do for the little time we have here."
Ty-Shou stared long and hard at Kitsai's face, even after the woman turned away. She just like anyone else, with skin, mostly smooth, some blemishes, cheeks and a nose that gave her face structure, and pupils, brow muscles and eyelashes that moved separately but as a visual unit. She wore clothes, with a different color and style than what was common in his lands, but still fitted for the same shoulders, the same chest, the same legs as women in his nation. She was just as human as anyone else he had seen. But the Vareeshi and their beliefs, it made them different, almost inhuman, to what he knew. How could another person see reality so differently?
"But I mean-- well, here on Opartha-- will it ever end?" Ty-Shou asked.
"Perhaps. Some Vareeshi legends say that at the end of time, all humanity will be under a singular pyramid, and the ruler of that pyramid will be like a god," Kitsai said. "It is called the Last Heaven."
Those words were captured by his mind. He felt a similar sensation to when Wo-Sa lectured him about his duties and destiny-- Wo-Sa mentioned the possibility that he would have to create his own Vareeshi pyramid, and though he had no feelings about it then, now he was feeling conflicted-- he rather not rise to power with so much violence. But it did make sense. "Perhaps you are not as far from the truth as I thought," Ty-Shou said.
"And you think that is you?" Kitsai turned from gazing at the forest to smile at Ty-Shou in disbelief.
"Yes. And it is not some empty megalomania. Nearly a thousand years of Bei-Sanian history and prophecy predict my arrival and my salvation of both the Bei-Sanians and all peoples. And even the Versalists concur, though they call me by a different name."
:style:
Maybe use a different word not as long as "megalomania"
:END:
"And what is that? That you are the god of all people? And you think everyone, even the Vareeshi, are your worshippers?" Kitsai asked.
"As I said, you are already one, you just don't know it," Ty-Shou said without a drop of humor. Kitsai gave a wide-eyed, flabbergasted expression, but Ty-Shou wasn't looking.
"Please, do not be offended. I don't know how someone could live with such ridiculous beliefs," Kitsai said.
Though it would have offended him if it had left anyone elses' mouth, for some reason, he knew Kitsai always spoke her mind honestly, and that cushioned the harshness. /I was just thinking the same about you/, he thought, but the words didn't leave his lips.
"We should leave before sunset," Ji-Xing came up next to the couple and spoke for what seemed like the first time today. He and Qi-An had enjoyed some of the food, but had been more reserved then the rest of the party. "We do not want to be caught here when king making starts."
"I need Tesaak's men," Kitsai said. "And is it any better to be sleeping in the wilderness with no one to guard us?"
"To be inside an enemy camp, and so close to another larger, threatening enemy-- yes, it would be better," Ji-Xing said.
Kitsai looked to Ty-Shou for backup. Ji-Xing crossed his arms. "I have no experience with king making, but from the sounds of it it sounds like a death sentence to be around anyone not in your pyramid," Ty-Shou said.
"Fine," Kitsai grumbled. "Let me just ask him one more time now, and then we'll leave."
Ji-Xing opened his mouth to protest, but Kitsai placed a hand on Ty-Shou's shoulder.
"You have to understand. This is my life. And my eternity. Did you save me just so I could die again with nothing?" Kitsai looked at Ty-Shou with innocent wide eyes.
Ty-Shou bit his lip. "Fine."
Kitsai smiled, and Ty-Shou felt it was true, and his heart warmed. He smiled back.


"He said yes, he said yes!" Kitsai bolted out of the manor and embraced Ty-Shou. Ty-Shou blushed and stood still as Kitsai whirled around him, her arms around his chest. She pulled back just before Ji-Xing reached a hand to step in.
"I can still escort you back to Bei-San if you like, as thanks," Kitsai said. "It'll cut down on the power of my first strike, but you saved my life."
"I--"
"Or!" Kitsai pointed a finger to the sky and her eyes widened even more, farther than what Ty-Shou thought was possible. "We can use one of Tesaak's-- well, now my-- Teleportation Heralds to quickly get you back to Beisan. We just have to wait until king making starts, and he transfers his pyramid to mine."
Ji-Xing shifted uncomfortably. Ty-Shou glanced from him to Kitsai.
"I thought we were to leave /before/ king making starts," Ty-Shou said.
Kitsai turned to him. "You'll be safe here. Even if Anut attacks, you'll be the first out of here with a Teleportation Herald. I promise you."
"Okay, well I need to gather all my people to tell them the news and get them ready," Kitsai said. "Even though Tesaak is moving into my pyramid, I'll probably just take his necklace 'cause their are way less of us. But I need to get everyone first and then we can find a monk."
"Well," Ty-Shou looked to Ji-Xing. "I guess we'll be fine then. I'm happy for you, Kitsai."
"Thank you, Ty-Shou. When king making is over, I will invite you to my new kingdom," Kitsai smiled.
Ty-Shou smiled back, but it seemed like an empty promise, or a future that would never come. Wo-Sa told him that king making could last anywhere from eight months to a bit over two years. It could be nearly double his current life experience before he met her again. Would he even really be the same the next time he saw her? Even though Ty-Shou wasn't actually a baby and had been reincarnated with an adult level of cognition and understanding, it would still be a significant change.
"Alright! I was determined to get this done even if it was just me and those sixty. With eight thousand..."
Kitsai pulled out her curved short sword. She looked in the reflection and smiled.
"I'll annhiliate Anut."


Even when he wasn't the one leading the group, Ty-Shou felt Excitement gathering in his heart from Kitsai's group forming. He didn't channel it-- that would be a disaster. But something deep in his makeup loved the community building, of seeing more people join on, of everyone's contagious excitement. He tried not to think about the fact that most of them were excited about a ritual, merciless blood war.
Everyone was smiling, chanting, admiring little gimmicks and clothes that Tesaak's townsfolk had made for them--
Deep horns shook the trees. They lasted long enough that Qi-An shut his ears, and Ty-Shou couldn't hear Ji-Xing's mouthing. After the third time he said it, Ty-Shou could read his lips-- "What's going on?!"
Kitsai gasped. Ty-Shou followed her eyes up. His stomach dropped-- he knew what it was, but his mind didn't want to confirm the horror unless he saw it in the sky. Branches blew in the wind. Grey clouds wisped past, but the large moon shone through against the overcast sky. As the dark veil passed by, it revealed an even darker sphere behind it.
The second moon had crossed into the path of the large moon.
King making.
* Chapter VII
Kitsai screamed. She jumped into a ready positon and pulled out her sword. Woman, children, and even some of the younger and older men cowered in the center of the group, but others followed suit and whipped out their spears.
"Don't worry! We should be safe!" she shouted, mostly to Ty-Shou and Ji-Xing. "At the beginning of king making some fed-up crazies always get an idea that they're gonna defect from their pyramid and start the next big one. It's tip delusion!"
"This isn't what I have in mine when I think safe!" Ji-Xing shouted. His skin was already shifting to steel.
Men howled at the moon. The same drums that had been used for a lively jig earlier sounded the rhythym of war in the forest.
A thin man with unkempt grey hair burst out from a small hut. He held a knife dripping with blood, followed by three more men, all younger, possibly his sons.
"Tesaak fell LAST kingmaking! All his people are mine! I will be a king! Cong Lang will be no more! It will by mine! Khua will bow! It will be mine! Xirin, Tehgohlee-- no one will speak their names! It will all be mine! There will only be Ding Wao!"
The thin man laughed maniacally.
Another man, long-haired, wild, and broad, ran up to the thin man and slammed a huge hand around his throat. He pushed him to the ground, choking him. He seemed to come out of nowhere-- he was probably hiding in the ferns.
The thin man's fingernails /tore/ at the broad man's nose as he struggled-- deep lines tore, like a cat's paw ripping a blanket. Before the thin man's followers could move in, the broad man growled like a bear and crushed the thin man's windpipe with a *crunch*.
He kept pounding on the man's skull, smashing it to pulp. The thin man's followers watched in silence.
The thin man's followers looked at each other-- before hooting and cheering and lining up behind the broad man.
Though he knew he was much more powerful than any of them, Ty-Shou's eyes darted around nervously. They weren't the only ones who had erupted already. A group of teenagers ran chased each other around buildings, holding large maces that were probably their fathers'. It had only been a minute, but somehow there were already bodies pinned against wood cabin walls by arrows. The screams of primal rage interluded with those of terror.
"TESAAK! TESAAK! TESAAK! TESAAK!"
A horde of men carrying torches, thrusting their weapons in the air, marched through the roads. They turned into the outcrop where Kitsai's people and Ty-Shou had gathered. At once, their leader, a shorter man, pointed and shouted--
"Them, them! They're not of Tesaak! GET THEM!"
When he talked, his consanants were softer-- Ty-Shou's jaw dropped. It was the cook that served him earlier,  man with missing teeth. In fact, many of the people, armed with bloodied weapons, were those that had been dancing and eating with them just hours before.
The horde rushed in, and stabbed at the closest members of Kitsai's pyramid, who fought back. They surrounded the broad man and his followers and beat them to death.
"STOP!" Kitsai shouted and held up her hands. "We are of-- Tesaak, yes! We are your pyramid!"
The attackers stepped back and looked to the man with missing teeth.
"Doesn't look like it. Look like you don't got any necklaces, which means you're fresh meat unless you surrender. Don't try to fool me 'cause you too dumb to leave here by king making." The man with missing teeth laughed.
"We were *just* about to get our necklaces. I swear on my heaven. Please. I don't want to kill my fellow pyramidmen," Ty-Shou couldn't tell how fake the helpless woman in her voice and her outstretched arms was.
"Well maybe you're willing to swear on your heaven... 'cause it doesn't look very big!" The man with missing teeth grinned again before pointing both of his knives at Kitsai. "But we aren't picky. We'll take your scraps too!"
The horde charged at Kitsai's pyramid. They fought like animals, jumping on people and swarming them. Blood from one man's neck splattered across ten people. A man wailed as a woman tore his finger with her teeth.
Ty-Shou unsheathed his sword and tried to use it to create distance between the attackers and a huddled family of three in Kitsai's pyramid. Ji-Xing pivoted out to follow him, his skin already steel. Ty-Shou froze -- the cook with missing teeth bounced on the balls of his feet and licked his lips in a devilish smile, pointing a spear at him. Ty-Shou pointed a shaky sword back.
"Please-- remember me? I tried your meats, they were delicious!" Ty-Shou said. "Kitsai is not lying-- these people are not your enemies!"
The cook ignored Ty-Shou and swerved around his sword. Ty-Shou could have lept to stab him, but he hesitated. The cook pounced, into the crowd of Kitsai's pyramid. He landed ontop of Jumill, the chubby woman Ty-Shou had befriended before. He stabbed both knifes downwards into each side of the woman's neck, and the woman collapsed. The cook dislodged the knives from the woman's neck and gave each a good lick, all while crouching over the woman's back like a perverse frog.
A ghostly gasp escaped Ty-Shou's lips-- he was frozen like a ghost, like he stuck watching these horrors but unable to affect them. Caman, Jumill's husband, screamed. The chubby man's palms squeezed against the size of his temples. He charged and kicked the cook in the face, pursuing him to the ground and beating him with knuckle-cracking punches. The cook reached for his fallen knife, and before Ty-Shou could stab him, he disembowled Caman. The chubby man's guts crashed out of his belly like a river breaking a dam all over the cooks' chest. The cook laughed as though it was a river of gold.
Ty-Shou heaved. With a primal yell, he beheaded the chef. A broken, queasy cry escaped his lips. How could such simple people feel that this carnage profited them, year after year?
"We have to get out of here, Ty-Shou!" Ji-Xing shouted. Ty-Shou felt the cold metal of the man's transformed skin on his arm.
Ty-Shou took a moment to slow his breathe. He wiped the blood of his chin.
He opened his mouth to speak, and then vomited. He wiped his mouth again.
"Our only safe out is to get Tesaak's Heralds to portal us out of here," Ty-Shou croaked.
"Does this look like anything Tesaak is on our side?" Ji-Xing shouted.
"These people have just gone crazy! It's a misunderstanding!" Kitsai shouted. "FUCK! Why did it have to be now?"
"Fine! We have to get to Tesaak's manor!" Ji-Xing said. He turned around and spotted Qi-An, who was frozen and quivering. The younger security guard's face was covered in blood.
"Get a hold of yourself, lad!" Ji-Xing grabbed Qi-An's shoulder.
Kitsai commanded her party to move as they fought off the violent horde. They ran down the streets, leaving a trail of bodies, some their own, some Tesaak's villagers. Other groups of villagers sprung out of houses for surprise attacks. It was still before sunset, and Ty-Shou tried to use what Light he had to defend the group. He felt Pity for those who were so brutally slaughtered in such a meaningless war, and used it to shrink them down to avoid attacks. He was even able to feel Pity for those who were attacking them, made to think that this violence would be their salvation, and shrink them until they were not a threat. He felt Exasperated by his attempts to end the violence being unheard, as if the people had been reduced to animals, and his shouts grew in power until they burst his enemy's eardrums. But mostly, he felt Overwhelmed, though he tried not to, and it channeled into a shield of energy around his body, which did protect those close to him, but mostly just himself, and thus, his efforts could not protect everyone. What was over eighty men and women was cut down to a few dozen by the time they reached Tesaak's manor.
When they got to Tesaak's manor, he was already waiting in the long grass where the livestock roamed, with a line of a dozen or so armed soldiers in his pyramid's warm brown. He wore a long wooden mask, though it was lifted above his scalp so his face was visible.
"Tesaak, Tesaak!" Kitsai shouted, her eyes flooded with tears. "Tell your men that we are in the same pyramid! Tell them that we were just getting our new necklaces!"
Tesaak lowered a long spear. His guards lowered theirs as well. Kitsai's party stopped in their tracks.
"I thought you said he joined you!" Ty-Shou shouted at Kitsai.
"He did, he did!" Kitsai's face flared red. She whipped back to Tesaak. "Are all men liars now?!"
"I made no official promise," Tesaak smirked. "You didn't speak to the monks. As far as the records show, you are still in Kitsai pyramid, and I am still in Tesaak pyramid." Tesaak walked back and forth in front of his line of soldiers.
"We were just going to! You know that! That's not fair!" Kitsai screamed.
"Let's be honest, Kitsai. My pyramid has no hope of surviving this king making. And Anut was always a conniving bastard-- a gift is the only hope I have of getting a good invitation into Cong Lang. And just like that, the prettiest little offering just slid right into my hand," Tesaak grinned.
"That's not your only option, Tesaak," Kitsai's eyes were wet with desperation. "You could be my second-- I could use your experience."
Tesaak sputtered. "What a joke. Starting a new pyramid a day before king making? I thought you were smarter than to get new tip delusions, Kitsai."
"The people of Cong Lang were loyal to my father and my family. They will see Anut's corruption and join me!" Kitsai shouted.
Tesaak shook his head. "You discount change, Kitsai," he grinned. "Anut has taken Cong Lang. He might even have killed some large pyramid leaders by now. This very well may be Anut's king making. Sure, many Vareeshi have their idea of honor, but people aren't loyal to a king who isn't king anymore. They aren't loyal to families or dynasties. This is about eternity."
Tesaak raised his sword and moved into a fighting stance.
"MENNN!!" Tesaak's scream blew across his whole field. It blew Ty-Shou's cheeks back, and the sheep and goats ran for the fences in terror.
"If you want a fucking damn good heaven--"
He paused and snapped his arm at Kitsai before pulling his wooden mask on. The socketless eyes of a demonic boar glared out from his head.
"KILLLLL THEMMMMM!!!! KILLL THEMMMM ALLLLLL!!!"
The man yelled and charged with their spears at Kitsai's pyramid. "RUN!" Kitsai shouted. The party dashed away from the manor, away from Tesaak's men.
But Ty-Shou stood still. His fist formed into a hammer, heated up by the coals of Indignation. No-- it was more than that. His fingers lurched out like a cat's claw. His chest pumped like bubbling volcano.
"Ty-Shou!" His shoulder felt like it was thrust back by Opartha itself. Ty-Shou thrust his elbow, ready to release a tsunami of power--
He paused as he met Ji-Xing's half-stone face. "Let's go!"
Ty-Shou glanced back to his attackers. The jumpy power from his hands was already fading. He turned and ran with Ji-Xing and Qi-An.
The three followed Kitsai's party and lept over the fence. The pursuing villagers had also heard Tesaak's call and were waiting beyond the gate, stabbing those who tried to hop over too close to them. The party ran straight into the forest, getting a good head start on the Tesaak's men, who had froze after witnessing the carnage.


Kitsai, Ty-Shou, Ji-Xing, Qi-An, Maleesh, and eight of Kitsai's followers sprinted through ferns, jumped over logs, and sidestepped trees. Tesaak's men had been following them, but their footsteps were getting fainter in the distance.
"Wait!" Ty-Shou hissed at Qi-An and Kitsai at the front of the group. They turned back and he motioned to a woman who was bent over. It was Maleesh, she was hyperventilating. The Vang Do woman was middle age, so she must have been through a king making, or even two. Ty-Shou had no idea how she'd survived before-- she must've just stayed holed up inside the whole time.
"Here," though Ty-Shou was still disgusted by the fact that she and the other Vang Doans had so cowardly avoided battle when they were fleeing the city, but he still felt something for the fact that she was a poor woman stuck in this violent time. He touched her shoulder and radiated Compassion. Maleesh's breathing slowed, and her posture fixed from a slump to a powerful stance-- her rather unfit body seemed to tighten and her veins pumped full with blood.
"Thank you, Synodontis," Maleesh smiled. Ty-Shou just smiled back and nodded.
The rest of the party huddled up to get ready to run again, but Qi-An raised his hand.
"I saw them split up," Qi-An said. "Maybe we can hide here and ambush the squad coming this way, and then make our break for it."
Some of Kitsai's pyramid were catching their breathe as well and looked eagerly to Kitsai for confirmation of the plan.
"Good idea, lad", Ji-Xing interrupted and made his way to hide behind a tree. His skin started turning to steel again. Everyone else followed.
Not long later, footsteps grew from a distant echo to squelches in the nearby mud. The soldiers had actually come from another direction, and the party shifted to hide themselves again.
The squad was smaller than the original mass of pursuers, but still larger than the party. They were professional soldiers, outfitted with full steel armor, swords, and shields. A captain led them at the front as they scanned the environment.
"I walk here every week. Something's off," the captain stopped in his tracks.
Ty-Shou peeked out from behind the ferns. He put his hand on his sword when Qi-An stepped forward to block them.
"Not yet," he said.
Ty-Shou's heart pounded. He crouched down.
The captain took a few more steps, checking his surroundings carefully.
"The swamp doesn't start this early...," the captain continued.
The soldiers glanced around. One's eyes widened. "Dark He--"
The man sputtered-- he clutched his neck to find a knife. It was held by a forearm, not connected to anything, floating in the air.
"Ambush!" the captain shouted. The men pivoted to face their backs to one another, but two were caught by spears stabbing out from the same area the forearm had come; the empty Space above the swamp.
"The fuck? They had the same idea we did!" Kitsai hissed.
"But who is it?" Ty-Shou asked.
"It doesn't matter, they're fighting each other! Let's go!" Ji-Xing hissed as he snuck along the tree line. The rest of the party followed.
They snuck some time until the sounds of clashing were just chirps in the distance. As they got through a thick patch of wet peat, Ji-Xing stopped.
"Stop. The ground ends here," he held out his arms to motion where. "It's a true swamp river. I think we should only pass as a last resort."
"There's a bridge up there," Qi-An pointed down the river.
The party snuck back behind the trees and waded through the peat up to the bridge. It was wide, plain plank bridge supported by logs, with no handles. Kitsai stepped onto the bridge--
"Wait, wait!"
Ty-Shou pushed forward to the front of the party. He held his sword forward and stepped onto the bridge. The Light crystals within shone two beams outwards. He twisted the sword so one faced forward, and squinted so the other didn't blind him. He inched forward on the bridge, shining the beam forward.
The Light hit something in mid-air-- armor! Eight men jumped out from next to the bridge, as if they were stepping out of an invisible portal. Ty-Shou jumped back and stabbed one in the arm.
"He's a Solid, get him!" the air seemed to shout.
Normally, Ji-Xing was faster then men half his age, but the steel skin made him slower. Six floating arms grabbed his shoulders.  He wrestled one off, and heard a *crack* as he elbowed the empty air. Kitsai also slashed one of the arms and heard a howl. Ji-Xing grunted in surprise as two arms below him grabbed his legs. They pulled him, sending him tumbling back-first into the swamp-- but he seemed to vanish into thin air.
"Ji-Xing!" Qi-An shouted and Ty-Shou glanced back, but kept his sword on the attackers in front of him. Qi-An whipped out his weapon, a long axe. He slashed it into the area of empty space where Ji-Xing was pulled into, at that seemed like only the strongest men could achieve. Blood splattered the bridge. An arm reached out with a sword and slashed at Qi-An-- it tore the shoulder leather off his armor, but he pivoted away in time, pushing the rest of the party back.
Kitsai and two tall soldiers loyal to her who could fit on the bridge pulled out their weapons, but they didn't have the range to reach over Qi-An and hit the invisible block of space where the hidden soldiers had Ji-Xing.
Ty-Shou did a warning slice at the eight men in front of him. One of them was using Illusion Heraldry to hide the rest, just like they had done to ambush Tesaak's soldiers earlier-- or perhaps the one doing the Illusion was still inside his own Illusion-- Ty-Shou couldn't tell how many they were hiding. Still, he knew his friend was in trouble and he knew he had the power to beat these soldiers-- he had the power of a god.
"This is your last chance. I promise you, if you do not surrender, you will die. I want to let you live," Ty-Shou said.
The soldiers just smiled at each other and charged at Ty-Shou. He felt the urgency to save his friend rise in his body-- Determination. A rainbow stream pulsated around his skin. Two of the soldiers swung at him-- he just focused on one, swinging his sword with all his might. The attacker screamed as his torso slid off his legs. The other attacker had landed a hit on Ty-Shou, but his spear just bounced off of the swirling Light surrounding Ty-Shou's body. He snapped backwards, but Ty-Shou had already landed a sword through his neck.
Qi-An still apprehensively held his axe, waiting for an opportunity to attack, but the invisible square gave him nothing.
The other soldiers didn't react fast enough and Ty-Shou was already in their midst. Though they may have known it was in vain, they stabbed at him with their weapons anyway, screaming louder as if that would increase the chance of hurting him, but nothing pierced his shimmering veil. He danced through them with his sword, ending the fight as he disemboweled two men at once. Right when he did that, the Illusion broke, and the party could see and hear four men pinning a struggling Ji-Xing under the swamp water.
Qi-An jumped into the swamp and swung his axe, again with lightning speed, crunching one of the soldier's ribs as he cut through his armor and torso. He had to pull to dislodge the axe, and Ty-Shou had jumped down and stabbed one of the soldiers in the back by the time Qi-An finished off the two remaining soldiers with a wide swing to their necks.
"Well, that was impressive," Kitsai chuckled. "I wish you were Vareeshi, Ty-Shou. I could win with just you in my pyramid."
As the last soldier's dead body fell into the swamp, Ji-Xing sat up and gasped for air. His steel body dripped with dirty swamp water.
"Ji-Xing-- I'm sorry. I failed my duty letting them get so close to killing you," Qi-An knelt down next to his mentor.
Ji-Xing took several deep breathes before responding. "It's okay, lad," he heaved. "You couldn't have seen it coming. And I've been through worse."
As Ji-Xing stood to his feet, Qi-An scrunched his nose. "What's that smell?"
"Smoke," Maleesh said and pointed to the treetops. A thick plume gathered in the sky.
"That bastard! My father would never do this!" Kitsai said.
"Cong Lang is coming, and if we run into one of their larger units we're screwed," Ji-Xing said. "I remember a tactic we used in my early days in the military. It's not the most honorable, but if you're trying to avoid a fight..."
Ji-Xing took off his tunic. His skin was still entirely steel. He put on one of the fallen Cong Lang's breastplates.
"No way! I will not dishonor my father's pyramid!" Kitsai shouted.
"Isn't it your rightful pyramid? Shouldn't you be able to wear their colors?" Ty-Shou asked.
Kitsai shook her head. "That's not how it works. We aren't like the Vang Do, we actually have a real code of honor, and this is prohibited."
"Clearly you are not. We see lives as more important than inane traditions. We wouldnt've been back home if it wasn't for that bastard Anut, so I see this as fair game," Maleesh said as she put on the Cong Lang armor.
"Maybe your lives," Kitsai said. She crossed her arms.
"We aren't the ones who tried to capture enemy leaders at a supposedly friendly ball less than a week before king making, and are now burning down nearby forests," Maleesh said.
Kitsai bit her lip, but her fist was still shaking.
Three of Kitsai's pyramid members, though they had frowns of shame, decided to follow Ji-Xing and put on the clothes and armor of the Cong Lang. The rest stood behind their leader and refused to change.
"I guess we can say you are prisoners we captured after killing a factor above you, and we're waiting till the next Sunday to turn you," Ty-Shou said as he put on a Cong Lang helmet.
"Whatever," Kitsai said.
"Walk in the center, then," Qi-An said. "That's what prisoners do. And make sure no one can see your weapons."
Kitsai rolled her eyes, but let the rest of the squad surround her. They crossed the bridge, with the four begrudging "prisoners" in the middle.
He hadn't even thought about how terrible this had gone. At least Wo-Sa couldn't blame him, cause it wasn't really his fault, right?
He sighed. And king making was going to be worse, even for Bei-San, or so Wo-Sa had said. Though their nation only had a tiny minority of Vareeshi, many foreign Vareeshi thought that all were Vareeshi, even if they didn't know it, and tried to capture Bei-Sanians to put in their pyramids. After today, he didn't want to see what organized, more powerful armies would do in the name of king making. But all that would be dealt with after he got back-- now was time for the trip-- the long, painful, scary, boring trip back.
They started on the trudge along the river, and as his shoes sunk into the mud, his hope sunk too. He may have been a god, but he understood how every innocent, soft-hearted peasant in the region had felt the second the small black moon had crossed over the large white moon. The first three years of his incarnation seemed like a tranquil dream compared to what was to come.

* Chapter VIII
"Do you like it, my Synodontis? I changed the style a bit," the servant, a petite girl dressed in a more adolescent Bei-Sanian style which included large white ribbons around the shoulders to represent purity and innocence, on the usual deep yellow dress.
Synodontis stared at his usual long golden robe in the oval, dark wood mirror with empty eyes. He couldn't tell what the servant was talking about, but his mind wasn't in the present moment, it was both in the past and also trying to disconnect in a state of relaxation. As soon as the Bei-Sanian city guard had returned him and the travelling party to the main palace, Ty-Shou could tell in Wo-Sa's eyes that the only thing that stopped the advisor from barraging him with question is that he saw how pale and emaciated they all looked. The servants immediately set Ty-Shou a warm bath and his favorite meal, fatty pork belly with green onions and rice, and Bei-San special chicken soup. The rest of the guests were treated to similar hospitality. Ty-Shou had noticed some bald men in the palace lobby, wearing the same robes as the men he had seen in the vision-- Vareeshi monks. He wondered about what they were doing here.
His mind floated back to the trip, even though he didn't want to think about it a second longer than he had to. Their Cong Lang disguises had come in handy twice, though Ty-Shou thanked himself it wasn't more than that; he almost thought Kitsai was going to blow their cover with how mad she looked at Ty-Shou's act of being a Cong Lang lieutenant. After they had left territory near Cong Lang, they were able to hide more successfully, though they had to fight off an ambush of thirty or so men once, thankfully at daytime, so Ty-Shou was able to take care of it without any causualities. The real battle was the lack of food-- they had to forage or go hungry most days of the ten day trek back. And overall, it was horrible-- he had begun with an exciting fantasy, and ended begging for it to be over, nearly crying over the deaths of ordinary people he had met along the way.

"My Synodontis?" the servant asked again.
"It looks gr--"
Loud banging on the door, which seemed so far away. The door was made of thick metal, which industrious look was hidden by a silver background that depicted abstract drawings of the sea and the mountains, as well as Bei-Sanian gold writing that spelled out that this was the room of the Synodontis. After a while, there was a click and a long push as the heavy door swung open. It was Wo-Sa. He bowed to Synodontis, as was customary, and exchanged wide smiles with the servant.
"Good, you're ready," Wo-Sa said. "We have much business to attend to."
With just a forced smile, Wo-Sa escorted the servant out the door, he had been holding it open with one foot since he entered. After he left and the door pounded shut, he held his ear to the door for a few more seconds, and then moved to stand over the Synodontis, who had sat down on the edge of his bed, right in the center of the circular entrance created by the three-sided drape cover.
"Ji-Xing told me what happened. I apologize you got pulled into that mess."
"I can't say it was comfortable, or expected," Ty-Shou laughed. "I wish it wasn't so violent-- but I was really exposed to the world, for real. That's what you wanted, right?"
Wo-Sa scratched his thin, long, silver beard. "Well, yes. But more just an outing and to meet the other leaders. Not what happened. But I'm glad you're seeing that way. As you know, the fool--"
"curses when he finds himself in a valley he doesn't know, while the wise man smiles at the chance to discover another treasure in the world," Ty-Shou finished in unison with Wo-Sa. Wo-Sa chuckled and smiled.
"Back to business. So you saw--"
Ty-Shou collapsed against the bed and stared up at the detailed rug encapsulating it.  "Ugh, I just got back. Not more politics, please." He remembered how he actually somewhat /despised/ his routine-- the boring learning and the constant lectures about responsiblity, although he felt guilty for it as any peasant or even merchant, heck, even aristocrat in Bei-San would envy his position of luxury and authority. No wonder he still somewhat enjoyed the outing even though it ended in violent, uncomfortable disaster.
"Sit up!" Wo-Sa shouted. "King making has just begun-- you saw how serious this is, this is not time for youthful sloth!"
Ty-Shou snapped to attention and sat up. Wo-Sa did not raise his voice often, and Ty-Shou could tell by the redness of his face and plumpness of his belly that he was more anxious then usual. Wo-Sa always had a good time in a Bei-Sanian kitchen or restaurant, but he seemed to eat even more when he was stressed.
"I'm sorry, my Synodontis," Wo-Sa sighed. "I've just been anxious since you disappeared, especially with it being king making."
Ty-Shou nodded. "I understand, Wo-Sa. Your service to me is ensuring that I perform my responsibilities."
Wo-Sa nodded back. "Your understanding is appreciated, my Synodontis. Now onto the issues," he cleared his throat. "First, let's make sure I am up to date on everything. It was Anut, the old third of Cong Lang, that assassinated the king of Cong Lang,
:comment:
forgot king's name, insert later
:END:
as well as his second of Cong Lang, Jakari, and attempting an assasination on the king's daughter fourth of Cong Lang, Kitsai?"
Ty-Shou nodded.
"And how do you know it was Anut?"
Ty-Shou looked out of the corner of his eye. "Well, to be honest, I don't /know/. But he was the member of Cong Lang who was present when Jakari was poisoned that was left unharm."
"What about Kitsai?" Wo-Sa raised an eyebrow.
Ty-Shou leaned his cheek against his hand like a disinterested teenager. He knew Wo-Sa would be Suspicious of her: Wo-Sa was as Suspicious of Ji-Xing, though he didn't make his paranoia as obvious. In fact, Wo-Sa had not allowed any new members of the court, or even servants inside the palace, who weren't of Bei-Sanian heritage, citing concerns that they might be spies. He had only made an exception with Ji-Xing's personal recommendation of Qi-An, who was Delmian by heritage, and it was a very reluctant exception.
"Well she wasn't poisoned, but she was attacked after-- she came to me almost dead. I had to heal her using Light," Ty-Shou said.
"Well couldn't she have attempted to poison Anut, but it went wrong somehow, and now she's coming to you to help her kill him?" Wo-Sa said without a beat passing. Ty-Shou had learned that the quiet, rotund advisor was a man of contradictions-- reserved but with a lightning-fast brain, always ready with a dumb smile in public yet deeply understanding of the most crafty, vile things one could do.
Ty-Shou tapped his fingers against his leg. He hadn't thought about if her motivations were really what she said they were-- after they had gotten out of Cong Lang, he just assumed that meant that he was definitely right and Ji-Xing was definitely wrong, even though he was never even Susipcious of her in the first place. He just thought Ji-Xing was paranoid for never placing her on guard when they were sleeping on the way back, as the head of security so often is.
"I mean, as I said, yes, I didn't see her actually being attacked, and I'm not even certain what happened with her father," Ty-Shou said. "But she seemed very angry at Anut, and her warning to us rang through. She didn't even request our help, she was ready to let us just go back to Bei-San and we only kept travelling with her cause her deal with one of the other kings outside Cong Lang failed and he tried to kill us all."
Wo-Sa scratched his chin. "And this king-- how do you know it was just him who betrayed you, and it wasn't a conspiracy? Did you ever see them talk alone, without you?"
"Well... once," Ty-Shou said. His fists clenched. There was no way that the whole time Kitsai was pretending. But why would she do that, just to have it fail and leave with Ty-Shou? It didn't make sense. "But she risked her life, and sacrificed a lot of lives to do that, and what would she even gain out of it? She's not a herald-- she was in way more danger than me when Tesaak betrayed us. And on the world stage, she's not our enemy, as non-Vareeshi we're the last people in Central Marthia they're thinking about. And that still doesn't explain anything about her family."
"It is a surprising but disheartening endeavor when one searches for the history of all that family members have done to other family members in the search for power," Wo-Sa said. "But you're right. There's not much she would gain out of that, from the sounds of it. Regardless, she is out of our hair now, and it's not wise to check the fangs of a snake."
Ty-Shou raised an eyebrow. "Well, she doesn't really have anywhere to go. We talked about her maybe staying within Bei-San's borders, if she keeps quiet and leaves the area if she plans to attack other pyramids."
"If you didn't see, my Synodontis, Vareeshi monks have arrived to collect her. She is being investigated for unlawful murder and unlawfully fleeing according to their customs and must be returned to Cong Lang at once," Wo-Sa replied.
Ty-Shou frowned. He thought they had been here to request that he make a pyramid. Sometimes he had to remember that he was only the center of the world in Bei-San.
"We aren't seriously returning her? You heard what I said, and you admitted that it's Anut that's guilty!" Ty-Shou shouted.
"I said more likely," Wo-Sa was always a stickler, something that got on Ty-Shou's nerves a bit. "And that is why the Vareeshi are conducting their own investigation."
"If they are to bring her back to Cong Lang, you know that spell her death!" Ty-Shou shouted.
"While it does seem more likely that Anut is the perpretator, it is not our business. The Vareeshi have their traditions and procedures and we must respect that, just as we ensure that they respect ours," Wo-Sa replied calmly.
"I won't let that happen!" Ty-Shou jumped to his feet and pushed past Wo-Sa. "Don't tell me you've already--" He ran for the door.
"Synodontis Ty-Shou!" Wo-Sa growled. Ty-Shou whipped back to Wo-Sa, his narrowed eyes asking, /Well, did you?/
"She is still in the palace," Wo-Sa said. "But she is just one individual. Do not be blinded by her plight and upset the entire Vareeshi world! The consequences will be catastrophic for the people of Bei-San!"
Ty-Shou shook his head. "I won't make an enemy of the Vareeshi monks. But I am the Synodontis of Bei-San; they will listen to me and my reason."
Wo-Sa sighed. "They have been here for weeks. Our meeting is not over, we must discuss our strategy so you can be ready to make decisions for your nation, not individuals who you don't control."
Ty-Shou clenched his fist, and Indignation gleamed red in his veins. "You just disrespected and lied about your Synodontis," Ty-Shou towered over Wo-Sa, and though the advisor was adept at hiding his fear, a small gulp escaped from his throat. "I am the Synodontis of all peoples, and only /ignite/ from the holy land of Bei-San."
Wo-Sa did several small nods. "Yes, my Synodontis. I made a mis--"
"And what strategy?" Ty-Shou butted in. "I already know what our plans are."
Wo-Sa waited for several seconds. Ty-Shou gave the tiniest nod. "I was just going to remind you why we aren't engaging with the Vareeshi right now.  If it even is wise to enter the game the Vareeshi play at all, we are not ready for it this king making. Its estimated that Khua has nearly five tImes as many soldiers as us, and Xirin and Cong Lang each have more than double. And we are next to all of them, in an extremely vulnerable position. It will be like oil and water to mix the Bei-San people and the Vareeshi. It will happen one day, but let's not make it more difficult than it has to be."
"See, I knew what the strategy was. We just wall up and wait, until all of you are dead of old age and then maybe I get to change the policy with a more passionate generation," Ty-Shou winced. "You told me you've tried to teach me about everything in the world because one day I might have to deal with all of it. "
"One day you will," Wo-Sa gently grabbed the arm of Ty-Shou's robe, his fingers failing to stretch the thick, rough fabric. "But not today."
Ty-Shou narrowed his eyebrows. His harsh, angular glare was amplified by the striking silver, while at the same time the curl of his eyes downwards of Wo-Sa's kind, lipless, wrinkled smile was amplified by the shimmering silver.
Ty-Shou yanked his elbow away. He swung open the heavily decorated massive metal door, even grunting as he did so, that protected his room.
"Wait!" Wo-Sa grabbed onto his shoulder again as Ty-Shou pried open the door. "Don't let your feelings blind you!"
Ty-Shou shoved Wo-Sa off and ran down the hall. "If I truly am the god of Bei-San!" he shouted back.
"Then aren't my feelings righteous!?"


Wo-Sa was already in the compound square, bowing to the monks and offering Kitsai like a pet at an auction. The widely spaced temples that decorated the square like the children of the grand palace, and open, flat stone tiles gave a feeling of protection and serenity, while not leaving one cramped. Though he was older and much more out of shape, Ty-Shou's advisor seemed to always know how to get from place to place in the palace compund in the quickest manner possible. Maybe the Synodontis should have channeled some of his Light to speed himself up.
"Greetings," Ty-Shou did a rushed bow and a forced smile. A few of the monks, who weren't already hunched over in engagement with Wo-Sa, returned a bow.
"As I was saying, Synodontis Ty-Shou was one of the leaders that was nearly trapped in the city by a lockdown, which he believes was ordered by Anut, third of Cong Lang, along with the assasination of king _, second Jakari, and other high members of Cong Lang, as well as the attempted assasination of fourth Kitsai," Wo-Sa motioned with both hands to Ty-Shou.
"Good," the tallest monk said. "This will be noted in our investigation."
"So you believe me that Anut is the most likely suspect?" Ty-Shou's eyes lit up.
"We do not believe anything yet. The investigation is still being conducted. As we have already told your advisor, we must deliver her back to Cong Lang because she is a pyramid member."
"But Kitsai has made her own pyramid now, and we are not Vareeshi, so are we not allowed to host her pyramid here?" Synodontis said.
"We have reports that she made left Cong Lang without announcement to make her own pyramid before king making begun, so we are allowed to seize her for an investigation and temporarily place her back in her previous pyramid," the monk said. "This measure is in place to prevent individuals from quickly abandoning their pyramids and betraying high-ranking members before those high-ranking members even know they have left their pyramid, and further it is illegal to leave one's pyramid before king making regardless."
"I only did that because Anut killed my brother and attacked me! Or were you not even aware of that?" Kitsai shouted.
""Yes, our Dark Herald received a message of the king and the second of Cong Lang's tragic death some time before king making begun," the tall monk said. "We are also investigating that matter, and the suspicious coincidence of your father and brother's deaths."
But if you take her back to Cong Lang, Anut will finish the job and kill her!" Synodontis shouted.
"You must be unfamiliar with Vareeshi law," the monk said in a stable, uninflected cadence that made him ironically sound even more smug. Ty-Shou hated it-- he wasn't used to someone sounding so arrogant, but the monk had made no official disrespect to him, so Ty-Shou would sound like the weird one if he even said anything. "To execute one's own members, without the violation of a code of law established by the king or the Vareeshi monks, is illegal, and it is expressly forbidden without an investigation by the monks during king making, or if the prosecution has not been completed before the start of a new king making after the event has occured."

consider changing name of Vareeshi monks
:END:
Wo-Sa glared at Ty-Shou. He /had/ been taught, even forced to memorize this, extensively by Wo-Sa. Maybe his feelings were blinding him. Ty-Shou took a deep breathe.
"I know that. I am just acknowledging that the precedent has shown that whoever the perpertrator is-- and Anut is a suspect-- they are not afraid to bend the rules and eliminate high members of Cong Lang, even their superiors. Is it wise to return the fourth, or now the second, who has already been attacked?"
"You make a good point, and the Vareeshi monks are not blind to that reality. We will keep watch over Kitsai, Anut and the rest of Cong Lang," the tall monk replied. The rest of the monks shifted forward to surround Kitsai.
"Please! Just let me talk to the Synodontis one last time before we leave?" Kitsai bent her head down and looked with wide eyes at the monks-- even having been so youngly reincarnated, Ty-Shou thought it was a bit childish.
"I recommend that we do not make the Vareeshi monks wait any longer than they already have," Wo-Sa stepped in between Kitsai and the monks and said through tight lips. He glared at the Synodontis again, but Ty-Shou knew his advisor was far too shrewd and image conscious to make a scene in front of a foreign government, especially one in which he appeared to be chastising his ruler.
"We have already waited a week. I do not see why we cannot wait a few moments more. Go ahead," the tall monk said.
"Thank you," Kitsai said with a bow. She joined Ty-Shou at his side.
"You are very gracious," Wo-Sa gave the monks a fake smile, and waited for the monks to turn back to each other and chatter before his eyebrows dropped back into a harsh /don't you dare/ to Ty-Shou.
Ty-Shou just looked away from his advisor. His discomfort infected an awkward motion he made for Kitsai to join him at a pavillion inside a nearby garden.


They walked down the long square stone slabs which descended like a drawn-out staircase. Silver poles connected by a long dark curved beam, almost like a large wooden unibrow, formed one of many identical gateways set equidistant along the stone slab path. If one looked to the next one, it seemed so close, but if one focused farther, it seemed like the gateways led on to the end of the world.
Ty-Shou spoke in broken whispers, glancing behind his shoulder anxiously, though they walked at a conversational pace. He had decided to walk to a farther spot, afraid that Wo-Sa would overhear them.
"You heard them. If you don't do anything, they'll take me back, and Anut will win," Kitsai said.
"What would you have me do? Go to war?" Ty-Shou asked. He glanced to Kitsai.
"Well... I would! Anut dishonorably trapped you and the other leaders and I don't doubt he probably caught some of them when king making started. You'll have support from most of the Vareeshi," Kitsai replied.
"But how would that help you now? Plus, no. Wo-Sa, the rest of my advisors and generals, the nobility, they will never be behind this war, and we don't even have a suitable justification. The people may start out passionate, but even they will begin to question why. The other leaders may understand, but this conflict is totally foreign to the nation I rule," Ty-Shou said.
Ty-Shou motioned for them to turn underneath a smaller arch intersecting the long path of gateways. Several concentric rings of stone slab paths created layers to the garden pond; a delicate balance of tranquility and variety was achieved with colorful lillies and flower bushes creating shadows for frogs and catfish. Ty-Shou had come here to relax after particularly content-heavy lessons on more than one occassion. In the way the sun refracted on the muddy pond, Ty-Shou had always wondered if his deeper self, his self which made the sun and brought his incarnated self forth, was sending himself a reminder of peace.
"If you win, Cong Lang will be yours, and you'll actually have a chance against even Khua," Kitsai interrupted Ty-Shou's calming thoughts.
Ty-Shou nodded toward the pavillion in the center of the centremost pond. He took a noticeable step back and bowed deeply before proferring his palm open towards her.
"Uh... what? You want me to go?" Kitsai raised an eyebrow.
Ty-Shou's mouth fell. He lowered "O-oh. I guess you Vareeshi don't have the same traditions as us. Yes, it is customary that the owner invite a guest, especially a woman, in like this."
Kitsai blushed and a small smile appeared on her face. "Oh. Sure, I'll pretend to be a Bei-Sanian woman for one afternoon."
She laid her palm down on Ty-Shou's open one and then turned back to the pavillion.
"I'm doing it right, right?" she asked.
"Close enough," Ty-Shou said. He stopped, released her hand, bowed again, and then motioned for one of the empty seats. Kitsai chuckled and shook her head.
"I'll stand. You can sit," she said.
Ty-Shou nodded and sat down.
Kitsai paced around the pavillion. She stopped on one side, her eyes scaling down the hill where white and yellow Bei-Sanian cottages popped out against the jagged dark stone, until her eyes met the horizon.
"If you really are a god destined to rule over the Vareeshi, or even all of Opartha-- shouldn't you start now? The world's a big place. How long can you sit in your little country without doing anything?" Kitsai asked.
"My people believe that I'm immortal," Ty-Shou said.
Kitsai sputtered, then turned back to Ty-Shou and closed her mouth. Ty-Shou clasped his hands casually in his lap. Her eyes widened in embarrassment. Ty-Shou gave back an understanding smile-- he tried to realize how mythical this would sound to an outsider.
"Do you-- no offense, Synodontis, do you really believe that?"
"How old do you think I look?" Ty-Shou lowered his chin, so his face was fully in the Light coming from the pavillion's side.
Kitsai scratched her chin and looked Ty-Shou up and down. "Uhm. Maybe just a little older than me. Twenty-eight?"
"I wasn't here twenty-eight years ago."
"Twenty... four, the--"
"I wasn't here twenty-four years ago, either. I wasn't here fifteen years ago. I wasn't here five years ago. You can ask Wo-Sa, you can ask my people, from the oldest crippled farmer to a wealthy child in school. I was reincarnated, from the Light, which I am, shot from the Sun above, three years ago."
Kitsai blinked rapidly and glanced around the pond surrounding them.
"Wo-Sa told me, that though my people do not believe exactly as they do, in the Versalist calendar, it was exactly a thousand years after I first left Opartha," Ty-Shou's voice was soft. Every time he repeated his history, which Wo-Sa had told him, which was not often, he scrummaged in his brain to find the actual memory, like any other memory, but there was nothing except a feeling. Sometimes, heavy, sometimes happy. Sometimes even painful. But no words, or visions, or even impressions of substance. Ty-Shou told himself, that the feeling was a gift from himself, from his higher, heavenly self, an intuition to guide him.
"So you really believe you are another man Synodontis? You believe you're a man from a thousand years ago?" Kitsai looked up at Synodontis. Her lips were not puckered, but in a smaller shape, which made her look more innocent than before.
Ty-Shou didn't think that much about the question-- he had felt the strangeness of it all deep inside so much already and didn't think he would find anything new.
"You know-- I guess I feel more comfortable now that we're here in my home-- but you've been mistaken since we've met. I don't know why I didn't tell you sooner-- Synodontis isn't my name. It's my title-- it means, 'guiding Light upon the world.' My real name is Ty-Shou."
"Oh, I'm so embarrassed. Well, may I just call you Ty-Shou then, Synodontis?" Kitsai asked.
Ty-Shou smiled and nodded.
"Alright, Ty-Shou...," she continued. Ty-Shou stepped back and his smile faded as she went on. /He/ had felt comfortable guiding her to call him by his personal name, but was this still part of a game she was playing? He didn't believe that Kitsai was lying when Ji-Xing suspected her-- he thought her story made sense, that of course she would feel vengeful against a close ally who killed her brother and father. But even if her motivations were out in the air, would she murder him to get to the top of the pyramid, like the Vareeshi always do?
He glanced at her again, not at what she was saying, but at her features, his eyes followed the way she moved, like a tall flower ever-readjusting itself to the face of the sun. One thing he did not have to be taught, that he knew from the day he was born, was the nature of sexuality, that he felt it and most others felt it the same, that it started when one was finishing childhood, blossomed awkwardly, and then dwindled down as life continued. He knew many basic things like that. Was Wo-Sa right? Were these drives controlling him?
This had been Ty-Shou's first experience outside of Bei-San, among real people, other people who's interest were not just to protect and teach him. They knew how powerful he was, but did they know how immature he was inside? Kitsai had acted surprised when Ty-Shou told her that he was not really an adult, in a way-- and of course, no one would suspect a grown man to actually only have a toddler's amount of memories, but Ty-Shou felt like most people could /tell/ he was behind, that he was out of place, and he especially felt that she could tell. This was another dynamic that he knew in his heart, that he didn't have to be taught-- was he just a young schoolboy, being played with by an older girl?
"...You got that?" Kitsai finished her long speech. After a few seconds, Ty-Shou left his train of thought and turned to her with a gaped mouth.
"Uh, you got that?" Kitsai asked again.
"Sorry," Ty-Shou said. "I got distracted."
Kitsai took a deep breathe. Her eyes bore a wave through Ty-Shou like the first breeze of winter.
"I asked you, Ty-Shou," Kitsai said. "If you are the final king that the Vareeshi speak of-- and the god of all peoples-- will you claim your destiny and found your own pyramid?"
* Chapter IX
Ty-Shou stared at Kitsai like a lone animal caught on the roadside.
"We're not Vareeshi," he finally said. "Bei-San would not accept me taking part in the Vareeshi customs."
"The Bei-Sanian people seem like they would do anything to follow you," Kitsai said.
"Well that's not the only problem," Ty-Shou said. "Bei-San still has less than half the soldiers Cong Lang has, and less than a fifth of--" He froze. He was repeating talking points he heard from Wo-Sa at this point, to justify why he /shouldn't/ claim his eternal destiny-- but wasn't that what his head advisor had been preparing him for since his reincarnation?
Kitsai noticed Ty-Shou's pause and placed her hand on his, "You said the Versalists believe in you. If you even got a fraction of them to follow you, you would have the largest pyramid."
"It's complicated. The Versalists have very different beliefs about me compared to the Bei-Sanians," Ty-Shou said. "But yes. They believe I am a god."
"You can get them," Kitsai said.
"Wo-Sa is right," Ty-Shou said. "Bei-San is not ready. And I thought you just wanted us to go to a regular war against Cong Lang? Why do we have to become Vareeshi?"
Kitsai sighed. "Because it's the only way you'll win. I know the Cong Lang military, and I know Anut. It's not quite Khua, but we have a formidable force. You'll need to sweep up some more forces from other pyramids, or get the Versalists on your side, and bait them into attacking you."
Ty-Shou shook his head. "No way. I've seen the fervor with which you Vareeshi fight during king making, and by joining I'll just have everyone on my back."
"King making battles may seem more intense, as it is an all out war. Yes, everyone is your enemy. But if you play strategically, with a defensive angle, you can gain more allies without losing too many men. If you manage to take out a high ranking officer, or though difficult, a king--"
"You can gain a whole nation without sacrificing one life. I know," Ty-Shou said.
"You need to take out someone high ranking in Xirin, or at least a king of a smaller pyramid if you want a chance against Cong Lang," Kitsai said. She kneeled down in front of Ty-Shou and placed a long, smooth hand in the palm of Ty-Shou's. "Even without all this religious stuff, I can sense that you are the type of leader people will rush to follow. Please. The world needs you. I need you."
A rush of energy sprung through Ty-Shou's body. Even though he was the uncontested leader of Bei-San, and even though he occassionally went out and was surrounded by the adoration of the people, he was heavily limited in his connection to the actual citizens due to necessity. /This/ is what he really felt he was destined for-- to really be the savior that he was supposed to be, who the Versalists called Aredal, and the Bei-Sanians called Synodontis.
Ty-Shou smiled and placed his hand over Kitsai's.
"I understand. I will do everything I can," Ty-Shou said, and Kitsai smiled back. "But I thought that if I make my own pyramid, we are enemies? Don't you find it dishonorable for enemy pyramids to enter an alliance like the Vang Do?"
"I do," Kitsai sighed and her shoulders slumped. "I've resigned to join yours if you found one."
Ty-Shou nodded. In her wide, wet eyes, even without his knowledge of Vareeshi customs he could understand that though she was asking him for a favor this was still a big sacrifice on her part.
And that spirit of sacrifice ignited both a deep respect and excitement in him. Even if his life was mostly boring politics, and he felt like he was truly destined for something greater, returning to Bei-San away from the chaos of king making had made that sinking feeling he had felt when leaving Tesaak's land just like a distant premonition. But would he really throw away his peace, and his people's peace, to right what had been done wrong to Kitsai, and for a little glory?
He didn't have time to give it the thought it needed. Though Wo-Sa's patience was outstanding, the advisor was smart enough to know when things were moving against him and to snatch the opportunity before it was out of his grip. He had led the monks to the garden, slowly following. The robed men gave the peaceful glances that the garden demanded, and shuffled towards the pavillion. Ty-Shou rose to his feet and stood in front of the pavillion entrance.
"I hope you had an enjoyable conversation," the tall monk smiled, standing just outside the pillars of the pavillion. "Please, step aside so we can escort Lady Kitsai to our carriage."
"That will not be necessary," Ty-Shou spoke.
Wo-Sa and the monks froze. Some monks in the back peeked forward like an old pet thinking it's about to be fed.
"Excuse me?" the tall monk said.
"I will be founding my own pyramid. Kitsai will be one of my top fifty, and I have more thousands of currently unassigned civilians who would be ready to join, I guarentee," Ty-Shou said.
The tall monk took another moment to process. "Kitsai will still be under investigation--"
"But it will be done here," Ty-Shou said.
Wo-Sa's thick neck twitched like a stuck machine. His eyes darted back and forth from the garden's surroundings out to the pathway in which they had arrived.
"We should not make such decisions here in the tranquil garden," the advisor gave a forced smile. "Especially if they are to give rise to raised voices."
"I'm sure it is okay," the tall monk said. "If the Synodontis truly wants to create his own pyramid, then there is nothing more to speak of."
Though he was sure Wo-Sa was just stalling, and he didn't believe in superstitions like energy when it came to these matters, Ty-Shou was sympathetic to leaving the garden only for peaceful matters, even if it would just affect his own mind. He stared at Wo-Sa.
Wo-Sa kept on his plastered smile as he glanced around again. "Still. This is not a place for highly official matters. It is my fault. We should have been patient and waited in the square."
Kitsai looked to Ty-Shou, who shrugged.
"Very well then," the tall monk replied. "Lead the way."
Wo-Sa bowed and escorted the monks back to the arched entrance of the garden, followed by the rest of the group. They turned back onto the long road, slowly ascending to the large compound of temples and the grand palace where they had left above.
Ahead, a man with fancy silver-and-black robes with a circular design in the back strolled, guarded by two men with a similar armor scheme.
"Lai-Ren!"
Ty-Shou exhaled, and shook his head. He knew he should've just finalized everything in the garden. The robed man, Lai-Ren, turned, and Wo-Sa waved.
Wo-Sa sped up the whole group again, and Lai-Ren and his group stopped to wait for them.
"Lai-Ren! Great to see you," Wo-Sa greeted Lai-Ren with a cheery smile. "I know that you and the rest of the high nobles have been waiting to discuss important matters with our Synodontis. And I believe that this new issue we are witnessing just at this moment is a great opportunity for the Synodontis to recieve the wisdom of your counsel."
Ty-Shou rolled his eyes. Even as a political novice, he knew that Wo-Sa would use the nobility's conservatism to further his own opinions, even against his god.
"We agreed to wait for a short discussion before, but we do not have time to sit through your bureaucratic processes," the tall monk stepped forth. "With respect, we will be leaving with Kitsai."
"This is my land, not yours. You entered with my permission, and you will leave with my permission. And I will definitely not let you leave with one of my guests without my permission," Ty-Shou raised his hand slightly-- not enough to touch the monk, or to even be a threat if he was a normal person, but as both the ruler of a nation and a powerful Light Herald it was one.
The monk met Ty-Shou in the eyes for a deep, unyielding stare. Whether it was a challenge, or a search, Ty-Shou did not know.
The monk looked to his colleagues. "With your permission, and with due respect, we ask that this decision not take longer than a few days."
Ty-Shou lowered his hand and nodded. "Trust me, my patience will also grow short if this matter is not settled by then."
The monk did a short bow to Ty-Shou, who returned one.
Lai-Ren looked to the monks, his face beset with concern. "Well... what exactly is this matter?"
"I have decided, after the death of the current coalition leader by the hands of his own lieutenant, and that lieutenant's attempted power grab on the other East Marthian leaders, that it is time that I fulfill my destiny as the god of all peoples, starting with the Vareeshi of East Marthia. I will be making my own pyramid to bring justice to the fallen king and bring all Vareeshi under my rule," Ty-Shou said.
"Oh." Lai-Ren looked down. He blinked with concern.
"Well, the rest of the high nobles have been eagerly waiting your return to hear the result of the trade negotiations," Lai-Ren said and lifted his chin back up. "But I'm sure this matter will have them even more... high energy."
Ty-Shou realized why he found the tall monk's overly neutral cadence so smug and annoying-- he had first heard it in Lai-Ren's voice. The high noble seemed to choose every word as to come across as arrogant as possible.
"Gather them, then."


The guards bowed as Ty-Shou entered the square-shaped court building and passed through the long golden rug at its center. The building was the second largest in the grand compound, after the grand palace, and the massive lobby was decorated with a true variety of art and artifacts, only united by the maintainer's composition, and the glass displays and gold frames. The valuables were single pieces, each donated by one of the current high court nobles, ancient preserved pottery, commissioned paintings of Bei-Sanian history, ceremonial swords.
Ty-Shou turned at in intersection in the rug. He stopped in front of one of the glass displays just before the decorated red doors of the main courtroom.
It was by far the display least appealing to the eye, and least obviously impressive: merely a faint handprint, outlined by charcoal residue, on a scraggly cut piece of leather, itself barely being held together.
Ty-Shou leaned in. The only reason this piece, which would have been discarded as trash at even a shady emporium, was placed among these priceless artifacts meant to show each high nobles' prestige and dedication to the nation was that it had been touched by him. Not by Ty-Shou-- well yes, by Ty-Shou, but by the Ty-Shou, Synodontis, of a millenia past. Who the nobles, and especially the one who had donated this, the elderly Vesh-Xiao, saw as both the same as Ty-Shou, but also as a distant god.
Ty-Shou held up his palm to the glass to match the imprint. It was identical, yes. But was he the same? Was he really that man-- that god, that had crafted a legend so deep that a noble family had kept a burnt piece of leather as a family heirloom for more generations than could be counted? That really, all these artifacts, not just that, all the grand buildings, no, all the /people/ in Bei-San had just been given to him the second he arrived back? Could he really fit /that/ imprint?
The double doors opened with a /creak/ and Ty-Shou stepped back from the glass. Wo-Sa greeted him with wide eyes, standing in the door way. The rest of the high nobility were seated at the long wooden table and got up the second they saw him.
Ty-Shou marched into the room. The high nobles all bowed to him, and somehow followed his march to the front of the room on the opposite sides of the doors with their bow. As he got to the front, they remained in their deep bow, pointed at him, some of the elderly ones' backs quivered. He cleared his throat.
"Please, be seated," Ty-Shou said.
The nobles all took their seats. There were about. Wo-Sa sat at a desk in the corner, and gripped something in his palm, which Ty-Shou knew to be a Dark Crystal. Next to him, a guest chair was brought for Kitsai.
The room had no windows but did not feel plain nor claustrophobic due to the silver rugs which were hung where the windows should be, decorated with abstract forms of nature. The nobles, dressed in
:comment:

:END:
, stared at Ty-Shou with eager but nervous eyes.
"For those uninformed, we have called you to discuss the possibility of us going to war with Cong Lang and other Vareeshi pyramids by declaring our own Vareeshi pyramid this king making. We, Synodontis of Bei-San, declare the high court is now in session."
As soon as he sat down in the much taller throne reserved for him, three of the nobles spoke:
"My Synodontis--"
They looked at each other. One graciously turned his palm to the other, and the third motioned in agreement.
"Perhaps it is foolish of us to be so unfamiliar with our enemies-- but not all of us are knowledgeable on the specifics of Vareeshi law. The topic makes many-- uncomfortable," the second one, a spindly man said. "First, I think it wise that we all understand the beast we are hitching ourselves to."
The nobles nodded in agreement.
"Seeing as we have an expert in attendance," a fat noble said and turned in his chair to eye Kitsai. "Perhaps our questions should be directed at her."
Kitsai shrugged and glanced around with a defensive frown.
"So one thing I do not understand. Pyramids like Cong Lang and Khua have grown large enough that they are able to act as nations, and are even the driving force of our East Marthian coalition. On the other hand, there are small Vareeshi tribes which foolishly attempt to raid our markets and fishing docks. But even these have, probably a thousand members. But how do these pyramids really grow from a single founder in king making to the size of a nation?"
"Even during king making, the king is allowed to recruit their first fifty members from any pyramid, no matter who they are," Kitsai said. "Usually the first fifty are people who conspired before king making actually begins to all join a new pyramid under one leader."
"That seems like a random rule," Lai-Ren said with disdain.
"The legend is that the first Vareeshi king received a message from heaven that he was destined to overthrow the corrupt ruler of his kingdom. So he found fifty powerful fighters and stormed the ruler's castle, and after killing him, inherited the entire kingdom, and that was the first Vareeshi pyramid."
:comment:
replace 'heaven' here with somehing else maybe
:END:
The nobles stayed silent, though it was obvious from the crunch of their eyes that some of them found the story untenable. Still, Ty-Shou knew that men of this rank knew better than to insult a guests' culture in polite court.
"So what?" the fat noble asked. "The Synodontis will recruit fifty men to this pyramid, and then the rest of our nobles and armies will continue as usual?"
"No," Kitsai said. "Any person who is not currently in a Vareeshi pyramid may join any one, with permission from the king of the pyramid they wish to join or those the king has elected for the task. Seeing as you are all not Vareeshi, this should not be a problem.  The same also holds for children who have come of age, or who have just been married. It is only adults who are already in a pyramid that must be converted through the death of their superiors during king making, where the majority of gains and losses are usually made."
The nobles looked at each other uncomfortably at the last clause.
"Lastly any king may agree to join his entire pyramid into another king's pyramid. Which is exactly what I'm offering to do," Kitsai said.
"And how many men will you bring to our cause."
"Only ten since I left. But I have sway among the Cong Lang superiors."
The fat noble sputtered. Kitsai glared at him.
"Do not underestimate how far my determination gets me," Kitsai said. "My father and brother were murdered by that /traitor/ in Cong Lang. I will do my best to bring /anyone/ to my side againt him."
Lai-Ren stood to his feet. The man of few movements brought everyone to his attention. "I believe as much as any noble in your eternal destiny, my Synodontis. But as it stands now, this decision will only aid a foreign interest, or perhaps only the interest of this girl!"
Wo-Sa stood up-- but Kitsai stood up and spoke first.
"I am not a girl! I am Lady Kitsai of--"
Kitsai paused. Her arms rest defiantly on the table, and all the nobles' eyes were on here.
"Of-- of-- Kitsai!"
The nobles laughed uproariously. Kitsai's face turned red. Wo-Sa sat back down with a sly smile and Ty-Shou grimaced-- the advisor knew not to interrupt a foe already making a mistake.
"Soon to be Bei-San! Or Synodontis!"
The nobles' howls grew in volume and variation.
"SILENCE!" Ty-Shou's fists shook the table with a SLAM.
Every jaw in the room snapped closed until it resembled an empty museum of statues. Ty-Shou moved his glare through the entire line of nobles before standing up straight.
"I did not know that my court was full of school children. You will respect my guests as you respect me," Ty-Shou said.
The nobles gave scared nods.
"I apologize on behalf of the high nobility, my Synodontis," Lai-Ren said. "Our behavior was unacceptable."
Ty-Shou gave a curt nod back.
An old man, with a long, hunched neck, stood this feet, his back, arms and legs shaking as he did so. He raised his finger for permission to talk, and Ty-Shou nodded and motioned to him.
"For those unfamiliar," the old man creepily smiled at Kitsai, "my name is Vesh-Xiao. With all due respect, my Synodontis, this is too complex of a decision to make so hastily," Vesh-Xiao turned back to Ty-Shou. "This will determine the future of Bei-San for centuries to come."
"That is a fair point, Vesh-Xiao," Ty-Shou said. "And I have been thinking about this for weeks." Ty-Shou's heart panged at the half-lie. It was true, the peripheries of his mind had been floating around the possibility of his rule over the Vareeshi people, and if that entailed making his own pyramid. But he hadn't seriously considered it until Kitsai brought it up mere hours ago.
This time, Wo-Sa raised his hand. Reluctantly, Ty-Shou motioned to his advisor.
"I will also add that joining the Vareeshi's king making will not just bring immense risk to the nation, by bringing us from a state of no active enemies to what is essentially a total war with all of East Marthia save a few nations. This will require immense sacrifice in the forms of food, taxes, and levies from the nobility," Wo-Sa said.
This brought frowns and looks between each other from the nobles.
"Your concerns are valid, Wo-Sa, but I am sure that the nobility are aware of their duty to this nation and the sacrifice that entails. Lai-Ren reminded me this morning that you were waiting on the result of the trade negotiations in Cong Lang. As the king was murdered, that opportunity obviously fell through. But the failure of that opportunity births forth another."
Both Wo-Sa and Kitsai scrunched their eyes in confusion.
"/This/ opportunity requires that we act with urgency," Ty-Shou continued as Vesh-Xiao lowered himself. "And not just this opportunity, but the threats we find ourselves facing. Yes, it is important to me, as it is to Lady Kitsai, that we bring Cong Lang to order and justice and do not allow such a flagrant act of betrayal to be unpunished in the eyes of East Marthia and the coalition. But we also seek a solution to counter the growing threat of Khua, who are inching on our southern and eastern border."
The nobles were nodding now, and were focused on Ty-Shou except for those who were excitedly whispering to each other.
"/This/ is an opportunity to lead the coalition, and if we believe in Bei-San's supremacy, we should take it. But the Vareeshi will only support us and respect us leaders if we are willing to fight as they do."
Some nobles were struck with concern at this point and exchanged more whispers, but Ty-Shou knew what was important was that they were undoubtedly taking what he said seriously.
"But more than that, /this/ is an opportunity to grow ourselves and the coalition. To be able to not shield our eyes from the future, but to face that monstrous Gestalt from Hierhersa and overcome it. We can master those who mastered us and bring both sides of the Delmian Empire into the fold. And with my holy mandate we can even claim the Versalists under my rule. As destiny has spoken, Bei-San will be the the turning point and centerpiece of a world revolution. We may require more men, more food, more money-- but all these will increase a hundredfold upon our guaranteed victory."
The whispers were turning into loud, energetic chatter.
"/If/ this works-- we will all gain immensly--"
"Against the Gestalt? My, I've just been trying not to think about them--"
"This is the beginning..."
But Ty-Shou took a second too long to let their excitement grow-- Wo-Sa pounced on the second to get a word in.
"Excuse me. My point before was not that the nobility are not willing to make sacrifices for our great nation. My point was that every single resource that Bei-San has will be sucked out of our land to go towards this war effort-- where they will be burned like grass to a fire," Wo-Sa said. The point silenced the room.
"I have the opposite position," Ty-Shou cut off the nobles before they could chatter amongst each other again. "If we act in fear, the other powers will continue to grow around us and consolidate, as they already have, and we will be at a bigger disadvantage than we are now. But, even if that happens, /I'm/ really not worried."
The nobles looked with wide, confused eyes at each other.
"My destiny is set in stone," Ty-Shou said flippantly, reminding them of his eternal security.
His eyebrows lowered, as did his voice. "But yours is not."
The statement made the nobles touch their own elbows and scrunch over. He could feel the existentsial angst he had set in.
"I will rise to rule the world from this very seat: this is the belief that is the foundation of Bei-San itself. But that could be far beyond your generation. If you choose to just fortify the current walls we have, I will just be here until another nation wise enough-- maybe, who knows, the Versalists-- decides to recognize my holiness and help me unite all peoples of Opartha. That would fulfill our prophecies. But do you really want that for Bei-San? Do you really want that for yourselves? Or do you want this kingdom at this hour to be the true turning point of the world?"
He held out both his hands to the table. "Are you among me the high nobility of that kingdom!?"
Silence.
Vesh-Xiao was the first to raise his body, and his shaky finger.
"Yes."
The rest of the nobles erupted in affirmative applause and cheers.
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"
Even the usually muted Lai-Ren was clapping along, though he looked characteristically unphased. Kitsai smiled and winked at Ty-Shou. The only one who looked truly worried was Wo-Sa, who had stood to his feet, but struggled to get the nobles attention.
"I will remind you--," Wo-Sa's voice was pushed out by the cheering of the nobles, "--that high ranking positions in Vareeshi pyramids bring additional risk as a single elimination from an enemy can win tens of thousands of men, or even half a kingdom."
Most the nobles didn't even hear Wo-Sa's complaint, and the advisor wasn't the type to yell or humiliate himself with repetition.
"As my advisor Wo-Sa has just reminded me," Ty-Shou shouted over the applause. "You will all have the opportunity to negotiate your new position in my pyramid. And I mandate that you also inform the lower nobles and experienced soldiers of this opportunity as well," He leaned back in his chair and clasped his fingers together as the nobles chattered on excitedly.
"Hail Synodontis!" some of the nobles shouted and did a Bei-Sanian salute in between their chatting. "Hail Synodontis!" More and more nobles joined in.
Wo-Sa, knowing he was beat, slumped back into his seat. Though he had nothing but love for his head advisor, and knew he was just doing what he thought best for Bei-San, Ty-Shou felt good. All of the insecurity about being so inexperienced washed away.
Ty-Shou pushed his throne back and stood to his feet again. The nobles simmered down at the sliding of the throne.
"With that, the court is out of session," Ty-Shou smiled.

Ty-Shou, Wo-Sa, the nobles, Kitsai, Ji-Xing, some guards, and the monk's footsteps echoed through the main chamber of the grand palace. Every inch of it was both opulent and perfect, the gold and diamonds showed immense wealth but their placement in artistic patterns alongside rich dark and crimson woods showed measure and thought. Silver stained glass windows brought from Riliolan lands gave even the natural lighting a royal twinkle.
But it was the true scale of the oval shape, that seemed like the center of a planet if it was hollow, that truly wowed Ty-Shou as well as anyone who stepped inside. It spoke that whoever owned it was a god-- but in fact made Ty-Shou feel just as small as anyone who walked its halls.
Ty-Shou had decided that the center of the main chamber would be the perfect place to begin his pyramid. If there was anything missing from the massive hall, it would be that the middle, so far from the tall outside walls, itself had nothing. The floors were beautiful quartz, cut with other stones to create circular patterns, but a massive pyramid would actually perfectly fit in the center of the grand chamber.
The Synodontis looked up to the roof which converged into a massive point at the center top, and back to the ground. A similar point was found in the center of the room, with some silver circles around it to make it easier to find. He glanced at the perimeter of the centermost circle, and took one small step back.
"We will have the basin be cut and the center precisely measured later," Wo-Sa whispered to Ty-Shou. Though he knew his head advisor was still adamantly anxious and against the Vareeshi propositon, he knew Wo-Sa was above all loyal and quick to move to the best strategy for the situation on hand. He had already accepted the new status quo and would put his mind to its concerns big and small, from war policy to the placement of the ceremonial pyramid.
"If you are ready, Synodontis--" the monk spoke to Ty-Shou, who nodded.
"Synodontis Ty-Shou Xing, on this day you officially declare your own pyramid. Let it be known that from this moment forward, anyone who joins themselves to you by placing their Wealth below yours is of eternal and absolute servitude to you, and also at risk of being of eternal and absolute servitude of another if a superior, whose position in the battle is a factor of theirs, is killed in battle, including yourself."
"To mark your place as king of this pyramid, we grant you this necklace. The necklace is of a unique color for your pyramid, which also has a marking of the name you wanted to give your pyramid in Vareeshi-- Bei-San, as well as your number. As we expect your pyramid to grow immensely, we will move a monastery into Bei-San to distribute Wealths and necklaces, with your express permission, of course."
"It will be granted," Ty-Shou said.
"Please, place your Wealth where you intend to build your pyramid," the monk motioned with his arm.
Ty-Shou stared down at the ball in his hands, his Wealth. It appeared to be made of stone, but must've been hollow on the inside as it was quite light.  The court artist had already added an etch of Ty-Shou returning gloriously in the sky, the sun speaking his arrival behind him, and had already shown Ty-Shou his early ideas that would be added later, as well as the Bei-San national motto, 'Radiant glory spreads from our land.'
He whispered the motto out loud. He glanced over the crowd. Wosa stood, hands folded. It was inexplicable that Ty-Shou was about to confirm a decision the advisor so dissapproved of. On the other hand, Ty-Shou could see the excitement spilling out from Kitsai's face. He turned back to the floor, to the silver quartz circle beneath him. He placed his Wealth down in the center of the grand hall. It wobbled before stabilizing.
The monk stepped forward and lifted the necklace over its head. They had done the courtesy of giving him a silver one-- the same color as his eyes and hair, and the national color.
"You are now the king of Bei-San pyramid. May your fight on Opartha expand the heavens gloriously."
The monk stepped back into the line of monks. Ty-Shou eyed them all.
"It will. My kingdom on Opartha will be an eternal heaven of its own," Ty-Shou said. He had respected the Vareeshi up to this point, but now he would let them know that it was Bei-San that was right, and they would bear witness to that. The monk held his lips tight.
From behind them was an eruption of applause-- the high nobles. Synodontis had barely left his sphere in the center of the room when they swarmed him.
"My Synodontis--"
"Out of my way--"
The hurried footsteps and chattering echoed through the grand palace.
Synodontis just stayed silent and kept walking on. He used to respond almost every time someone in a crowd would call out for him, and would literally be swarmed in the streets from dawn till dusk, until Wo-Sa taught him better. Ji-Xing and the rest of the guards stood between them and Synodontis and walked as a barrier between them.
Regardless, a thin, short noble had weaved through the crowd and got up just between Synodontis and the guards.
"My Synodontis, I know that the grand palace is wealthy enough, but what it needs is men PERMANENTLY LOYAL to this cause! And that I have!" the small man shouted, his little legs running keep up with the moving guards.
"The Synodontis has received enough questions and has already issued times for you to negotiate this matter," Ji-Xing shouted to the noble. "Back off!"
The small noble stopped, and the rest of the clamoring died down. They began to disperse.
Ty-Shou sped up in his strut to the exit of the grand palace. However, he slowed his roll as he noticed two figures standing right in the center of the large archway, one in silver and black robes and one in a wide-bottomed silver dress. Ty-Shou pursed his lips as he got closer-- it was Lai-Ren. He skipped the ceremony, and waited outside the door, knowing that Ty-Shou would likely be the first to leave. Ty-Shou had begun to notice that Lai-Ren was always one step ahead of the others, likely due to his more observing and reserved nature.
Ty-Shou thought about just changing directions-- but he was the Synodontis, why would he make himself look so weak in front of a politicking, but ultimately friendly noble?
"My Synodontis," Lai-Ren bowed. "Congratulations on your pyramid. This is my daughter, Liang-Tai. I have been telling her about the age of glory to come, and she is very excited."
Liang-Tai smiled, her mouth stopping each time as her lips pulled apart in several steps. Though at first it was forced and awkward, she blushed after and craned her ear to her shoulder, and then the smile became more relaxed and geniuine, and Ty-Shou thought it was rather adorable. She brushed her a long dark braid away from her face and kept smiling at him. Ty-Shou bit his jaw and looked away to suppress a blush of his own. Her thin features, wispy movements, and large lips and eyes that moved as one gave her an innocent and delicate beauty, one that he could not deny.
"Our appreciations, Lord Lai-Ren. Though on the surface this conflict may seem purely militaristic, our bright minds are always the key ingredient in victory," Ty-Shou said.
"Oh, so you are aware that Liang-Tai is about to gradute from Master Jung-Ko's academy? I am not one to brag, except about my daughter. She is the top student in the Geopolitics and Relations program," Lai-Ren gave Liang-Tai a hug with one arm.
Ty-Shou eyes widened. Of course he didn't know, about the particulars of one high nobles' daughters' education. Still, he decided it was best to play it off in a way that wasn't explicitly lying.
"That is wonderful," Ty-Shou said. "We will need many competent negotiators as we expand our global reach."
"Oh? You and I think alike, my Synodontis," Lai-Ren said. "I have been trying to plan her future, though she hates to discuss it."
"Well, from what I've seen of the other delegations, you would certainly be the most charming. Though the competition isn't exactly the best-- a lot of old men," Ty-Shou said, and Liang-Tai giggled. As she caught herself, her cheeks flushed red again. She lifted her shoulders and looked to the side while itching her index and middle fingers with her opposite ring finger.
"Well, I wish you energy for all these decisions and look forward to our private meeting this week," Lai-Ren said. He turned to his daughter and clutched her hand again. "Let us go."
He did a deep bow. "My Synodontis."
Ty-Shou's smile faded as they walked down the steps of the grand palace into the main compound. He had geninuinely felt attracted to her, but this was such an /obvious/ ploy from Lai-Ren-- in fact, he would've assummed the noble would use more cunning. Was it really just, he thought it be more prudent to be upfront in a manner like this, or was something more sinister going on?
He shook it off. He didn't have time to think about that right now. He turned and blushed as he noticed that not only were his guards behind him, but the nobles had caught up and were all watching in silence.
"You know, my daughter is much more beautiful," a dark-skinned noble raised his finger.
"Hah! You don't know what you're talking about! My daughter makes the entire street stop when she walks by!" Another hollered.
"The Synodontis isn't some teenage fool! He knows what he needs men for some war to come, not a plaything!"
"FOOD is what wins wars, and I--"
"ENOUGH!"
The group screamed in agony and clasped their ears, even the guards and Ji-Xing. The hall of the grand palace spread the echo of his shout across what felt like the entire land. Ty-Shou's eyes widened-- he had used a scream of Exasperation. Blood dripped out of one of the nearest noble's ear.
"I--"
"We are sorry, m-my Synodontis," a fat noble said. He and the others looked to each other, their bodies quivering like hummingbirds.
The shout hadn't even channeled that much Light-- Ty-Shou had only gathered as much as he did standing directly in the entrance for less than a minute. He looked at the terrified nobles.
The man instinctively shrunk away. Ty-Shou exposed his palm more gently, and finally their his hand connected to his ear.
This one was easy to find, the man was Shocked and Terrified. Though he could not see inside his ear, the man's quivering stopped as golden Light flowed from Ty-Shou's fingers to his ear.
Ty-Shou didn't know what to say. He wanted to apologize, but the Synodontis was never wrong-- he was /perfect/. But how could he be, erupting like this? It was just one of many things that didn't seem "perfect" about him, and he thought about it often. He sat up at night, using his philosophy and linguistics lessons from Wo-Sa, trying to define what "perfect" could even mean when applied to humans. He even stayed up late reading a book donated by one of the rare Versalist missionaries in the area, a book he would have no interest in reading otherwise, to see how they defined perfection, and to see how they defined /him/, or at least the being they thought he was. To them, perfection meant the embodiment of specific Virtues, but Ty-Shou didn't understand how someone could be perfect, but only particularly, only embodying SOME good Virtues. And couldn't some Virtues go to far? Couldn't Bravery turn into recklessness? Joy into mania? Whatever the case, when he really thought of it alone, the definitions of perfection felt a bit... arbitrary. How would he know, how could he /promise/ to others, that he was it? Did others really even believe it?
He looked at the nobles, with their wide, nervous eyes. How could he respond so they would still believe that he was?
"High noblemen of Bei-San. I am Proud of your Eagerness, but I am Disgusted that it seems that you are seeing this opportunity for our kingdom as merely an opportunity for personal gain. I am Eager to hear what you can contribute in our coming meetings, but that is what that is for. Now is not a time to squabble amongst each other but to think about how you can use your resources together, for a much higher kingdom to come."
With that, Ty-Shou nodded to his guard and turned away. The rest of the nobles stayed at the top of the steps, and Ty-Shou didn't know where the monks or Kitsai were, though they definitely heard that shout.
He continued down the steps with his guards in tow, past the main buildings of the central compound, until he reached the hill on which the compound lie, staring down the long stretch of steps that led down the mountain.
From this height, he could see the city walls and the tips of castles which looked like little stones from this height-- the cities of what would likely be one of his main enemies, Xirin.
He heard shuffling behind him. Without looking, Ty-Shou could sense the man just by the patter of his movement and the slight smell of his favorite lavendar soap.
"What do you have to say, Wo-Sa?"
The older advisor had been the only one brave enough, and with enough authority, to follow Ty-Shou from the grand palace.
"Though you know what I think about that outburst at the end, I thought you handled the high nobility well both in the court and during the ceremony," Wo-Sa said. "I know their bartering is annoying, but ultimately this is an opportunity to further our centralization. The worrying class is not the high nobility, but the lower nobility."
"So you have already accepted my decision," Ty-Shou said.
"You have begun a new age, my Synodontis," Wo-Sa croaked. "Though my mind is pessimistic, my heart prays it is one of success and glory."
Ty-Shou's gaze didn't move from the horizon.
"Your god has heard your prayers."


Ty-Shou moved under the stars in the central compound, his bodyguards in tow.
"There you are!" A figure approached them. They had been coming out from one of the many square, clay tile-roofed buildings, the general embassy housing. Ty-Shou could tell from her bouncy, high-energy run that it was Kitsai.
"I was coming to speak to Maleesh, actually, but I guess that can be left for another time," Ty-Shou said.
Though this was her first time here, she seemed to make her way around the place exceptionally well, in some ways even better than Ty-Shou himself.
Kitsai nodded. Ty-Shou could tell by her more rigid movements that she was a bit tense from his shout earlier, even though he didn't see her in the crowd.
"Some privacy, please," Ty-Shou said to his guards.
Ji-Xing grunted. The head of security always felt strongly about being more than a few feet from him at night. Ty-Shou held up a shimmering Light Crystal to assure the man.
Ty-Shou and Kitsai wandered off behind a bush that walled a clean corner garden in the square, between two of the square buildings. In the central compound, high above the surrounding land, the only sound that could be heard at night was the peaceful /ssss/ of the imported Jaraladi garden snakes. The guards followed some fifty paces behind.
"So. You did it," Kitsai smiled. "We're gonna get that bastard."
"Well," Ty-Shou said. "Wo-Sa and I were discussing that we should focus on first fortifying, then sweeping up the local minors, and then trying to take out a superior in Hysho and Xirin."
"What?" Kitsai's mouth stretched in a square shape, her eyes pointed down like a cat's. "And then, in ten king makings, we'll kill Anut's grandson?"
Ty-Shou sighed. "I thought you were more aware of the actual reality of warfare."
"But if you just listen to Wo-Sa, he'll just keep making you play more and more defensive until you're basically not even participating any more, like he wanted!" Kitsai shouted.
"You don't know Wo-Sa. He doesn't work like that, he's already accepted that I have my pyramid and is just deducing the optimal strategy," Ty-Shou said.
"From his perspective. Which was to meddle in Vareeshi affairs as little as possible," Kitsai returned.
Ty-Shou sat down on the grass, his back collapsed against the bush. These few weeks had been absolutely exhausting. Kitsai crouched down next to him.
"Look. I trust Wo-Sa. He is the only one I know will be objective, especially when it comes to these things. The high nobles are out for themselves, and after what happened today, I don't know. And unsurprisingly, it's going to be the rest of the nation that we're gonna struggle to get behind us, all while the other Vareeshi are ready for this fight," Ty-Shou said. "I don't want to regret making this decision."
"I know," Kitsai placed a hand on Ty-Shou's thigh. Instantly, his skin sparked, almost like when he was using a Light power, but instead like it was going /inward/.
"They already believe in you," Kitsai met Ty-Shou's eyes. "You just need to do something to remind them. To wow them."
"And what will that be? Even if some see me on the battlefield, that will only wow those there, and the nobility usually doesn't care for soldier's gossip," Ty-Shou said.
"You should do what we talked about," Kitsai said. "Go to the Versalists. Imagine-- imagine what the nobles would say-- imagine how /scared/ the other Vareeshi would be, if you brought the entire west under your heel in one day!"
"But I've never been there before," Ty-Shou said.
"And you never went to Cong Lang either, and looked how that turned out!" Kitsai laughed, and Ty-Shou chuckled under his breathe. "But seriously. I don't know much, but I know the Versalists are waiting for you."
She reached for his hand, and opened up some of his fingers, so the Light Crystal shone on his face, and just the tip of her most prominent features, the underside of her hazel eyes, her thin nose, and her sharp cheeks and chin.
"We're all waiting for someone like you."
Ty-Shou shut his hand over the Crystal and pulled away. His heart went on full speed. The heat on his cheeks pushed away all other sensation.
He took a deep breathe before continuing. Though he couldn't even see more than her general outline in the Darkness, part of him wanted to get close to her. The other part was paranoid that she would reach her hand forward at any moment. He brought his attention back to the topic.
"One of the palace Portallers will be awake, they have to be on call all day and night," Ty-Shou stood to his feet. "You're right, we should do this right now. If I get Wreathward, the game will be over before it starts."
He couldn't see her at all, but her voice sounded lower when she spoke.
"Yeah, you should go tonight."
He thought about reaching out for her hand, but decided against it. Just then, he heard the footsteps of his guards round the corner.
"I'll lead you back to your room," Ty-Shou said.
"That's okay," Kitsai said.
Before he could respond, her footsteps knocked away on the stone slabs. He knew that she felt like he had rejected her. He wished it wasn't in the Darkness, so she could see his nervousness, how he really did want to connect with her but just got stuck. But it was too late, and her mission was more urgent than her feelings. Right?
"We're going to the royal portal chamber," Ty-Shou said to his guards.
If he waited a few more hours, he could arrive just as it was dawn in Nairfalk. That felt right, for the God of Light to arrive alongside the rising sun.


"We have many great stone masons in our lands," Ty-Shou said.
Ruit leaned in, "is that truly so? Perhaps I will have to come during King Making to recruit some."
Confusion turned in Ty-Shou's belly. He had tried to relate to this interloper, and the king had mocked him. He wanted to reach out to grab Ruit's face. How funny would the joke seem when Ty-Shou infused his Indignant rage onto the king's skin?
Ruit let out the same laugh he had only moments ago before his face fell to a frown.  "Ah, it appears I finished my drink."
