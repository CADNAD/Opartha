Okin shoved through the crowds as he made his way though the market sector toward the visiting complex. 

_I need to find a new place to stay, a new place to hide. I need to find a new place to sleep, **now.**_

Okin didn’t exactly trust the vagabond, and he didn’t want to be sleeping in the man’s solitary-like underground bunker for the rest of his time here--- Olitheon only knew how long it would be. 

“Sorry about that,” Okin said as his shoulder bumped into a man dressed in a lavish navy coat with yellow engravings. The man glared at him, scowling, but Okin kept up the pace of his stride, not looking back.

Finally, he had reached the visiting complex, and rushed through the hallways without confirming his identity with the Istar, who was sweeping in the hall. It didn’t matter; she knew him by name already, and he wouldn’t be staying here for long.

Okin knocked violently at Gendro’s door.

“Open up Gendro, it’s an emergency!”

He heard rushed stomping from behind the door, and it swung open, revealing a disheveled Gendro, who was only wearing a loose cloth shirt and silk pants. 

“What is it Okin, I was sleeping!”

“Gendro, we have to go. There are men here who want to kill me. I don’t have time to explain. Just get your armour on, gather your things, and let’s go!”

Even the lethargic Rothar obeyed the command with haste. He rushed over to the corner of his room where his light leather armour lay\[ Not sure if he should have this as his armour\], and began putting it on.

Okin then bolted over to his room which was just one space over, he would need the little money he had left in his coin pouch to survive the upcoming time he would be hiding out in The Citadel. Everything else could stay. 

He flung the door open, frantically searching the room for his coin pouch. It was sitting on the dresser, and he strode forward to get it.

And from behind the bed, they jumped.

Two men, dressed in black robes with even darker masks, which shielded all but their eyes, and stuck out, almost like a large bird’s beak. The robes bore no insignia, and neither did the twin daggers they held.

Okin backed up against the wall as the men slowly approached, daggers in hand.

“Gendro! Help!”

The closer one charged forward as the other leaped over the bed in an effort to corner Okin’s only escape route. The Ather had nothing to protect himself and no fighting experience,\[ I think they get some trainnig. Could be good to showcase that?\]  so he kept his movements slow and evasive; his only hope was to stall.

He narrowly ducked an attack from the approaching assassin, staggering backwards into the hall. And then he ran, both of the assassins hot on his trail.

But not for long. Okin looked back as he heard a booming *crack,* and turned just in time to see the first assassin barrel into the wall, his bones snapping against the rough stone, cracking it. The only thing remaining solid was Gendro’s fist, which had smashed into the side of the assassin’s skull, busting a massive dent into his cheek.

From his neck swung a golden necklace, its shining radiance completely outclassed by the pendant which balanced at the end of the necklace: the glowing brilliance of a full Light Crystal.

The other assassin turned in surprise, thrusting his dagger into Gendro’s side. The Rothar let out a primal scream in pain, clutching both sides of the attacker’s head, and twisting it harshly, snapping his neck in two.

The dark-robed man fell to his knees, collapsing to the floor dead.

Okin’s jaw hung in shock at the two dead assassins, and the dagger which was still lodged in Gendro’s side, just above his hip\[ 2021-03-19, 4:53 PM

Perhaps change this scene so Gendro is more shocked at killing a man\].

“G-Gendro. T-Thank you. Are you--- we need to get you some care.”

Gendro shook his head, and pulled out the dagger.

He let out a demonic exhale even through a bitten lip, and blood began to flow from the gash the dagger left. Okin rushed over to his friends’ side. Why would he have done such a thing? The dagger hadn’t pierced any vital organs, but now he was going to bleed out and die!

Okin moved aside Gendro’s armour and undershirt to see the spilling wound. “Gendro, what are you doing!? Why in Aredal’s name would you do that? What has gotten into you---“

Gendro held a finger to Okin’s mouth to silence him.  

The bright aura of the Light Crystal slowly began to dim, and Okin noticed that the cut slowly began leaking less and less blood. 

The ends of Gendro’s lips curled up in a smile as a look of understanding slowly formed on Okin’s face.

“You’ve never seen a real Absorption Herald in action before, have you?”

Okin shook his head. “I sure am glad you are one though. We would’ve both been dead.” Okin looked down to the two fallen corpses that lay dead around them. The sharp stab of shame consumed him--- Gendro’s duty, as an assigned Rothar, was to protect his Ather first and foremost. *He* had called for Gendro’s help. These deaths were on his hands, not Gendro’s. He didn’t command his Rothar to stop, he didn’t even feel any remorse until after the deed was finished.

Okin pulled off the black, beak-like mask off of the intruder who Gendro had hit into the wall. His jaw was completely dislodged, blood rivered from his nose and gums, and a dark crater was engraved on the side of his face. Okin didn’t recognize him.

“Looking at how badly I messed his face up, I don’t think you would be able to tell even if it was your best friend,” Gendro said. “Which of course it couldn’t be, because I’m standing right here.” The Rothar smiled mischievously.

“Why couldn’t they have hit your vocal cords, so at least I would get some peace and quiet for a few hours?” Okin laughed. “But thank you, Gendro. Perhaps you aren’t as lazy as you purport to be.”

Okin’s smile faded as his guilt quickly returned, a deep shame washing over him for acting so light-hearted during this dire situation. He had essentially murdered two men. But, these men *had* sneaked into his residence with the attempt to kill him, presumptively to hide a dark secret of corruption within The Citadel. Was it the Justice of Aredal that they meet their doom? 

_Aredal III, line LVI: If any being threatens or seeks to harm another, you must stand in between the wrath of the first. That is duty, that is Justice**.**_

Sure, that exempted Gendro. But truthfully, Okin hadn’t harmed these men because they sought to destroy others, but because they had sought to destroy *him.* Did that truly justify his actions?

*I’m not so sure,* Okin thought. But he didn’t have time to debate ether religious philosophy in his head. There had been so many brutal, bewildering questions asked in just the past few weeks, and Okin didn’t have time to answer *any* of them. Were Billy’s allegations towards The Synodontis completely unfounded? Why was Aldwin covering up the capture and escape of Billy? Why is Aldwin pushing to elect his incompetent son? Why had he felt such heavy guilt about the murder of the servants of Tregale? What were the true motives of this strange cult that meets during the night? 

No, he didn’t have time to sit around and think. And he was immediately reminded of that fact by the high-pitched scream of a mortified Istar.

“Gendro, let’s go!” Okin sprinted through the hallway, shielding his face from the Istar whose mouth hung open in a constant scream, her thin hands on her cheeks. The two men raced out of the complex.
