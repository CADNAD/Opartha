A flurry of chimes rung above him, and Okin jerked his neck up. It was only bells at the top of the door. 

Okin stepped inside, and the wooden door hinged itself closed, ringing the chimes again.

Okin’s eyes wandered around the shop. Papers were *everywhere*, and Okin wondered if they were merely useless or old, or if there was some sort of advanced organization to what looked to be a total mess. In the centre of it all, though, was that giant wooden contraption, lined with huge gears and centred by a stand which held what looked like to be an endless scroll of paper. And there were two identical models next to it.

The printing press. Okin knew little about its operation, only that *this machine* was how Nairfalk and Trenta had stayed ahead of almost the entire rest of the Opartha in terms of literacy and technology.

“Hello?” A creaky voice came from the back of the room. 

“Yes, hello?” Okin shouted towards the voice. He leant to get a better look, but he could only dozens of boxes piled ontop of each other and what must’ve been dozens of thousands of sheets of paper in the back. There was also a tall walnut desk completely unattended to.

He heard shuffling, and the click of a door unlocking from the back of the shop.

An elderly, square man stepped out from the door, and proceeded to lock it. He looked up at Okin with small, feint eyes and smiled. 

“An Ather? What may I do for you?” His hand and neck shook as he leaned forward, but his eyes were still so squinted it appeared as if he couldn’t see anything. 

Okin swung his satchel forward and pulled out the two sheets of paper. He had transcribed the sections of both the Fourth Book and *A History of Wreathwardian Exploration in the Second Imperial Age.*  “I need to print out several hundreds of copies of these two passages and have them pasted over town and given to every scholar, historian and clergy member in The Citadel,” he held forward the papers.

“I cannot really assist you in getting these to the Athers or the scholars, but I should be able to print out enough copies for you,” the elderly man said. “Let me see what you have.”

Okin handed the man the papers. The man waddled over to the empty desk and took a pair of large spectacles. With a shaky hand, he placed them on his nose, leaning forward as he read the pages.

Okin’s legs shook as he watched the man read. Going in, he hoped that whoever would print the text would be too lazy to read it over.

The old man’s eyebrows furrowed as he pulled over the second page. His face only wrinkled more and he grew closer to the page as he continued reading, which made Okin’s shrivel into a nervous scowl.

“I--- it appears to all be in order grammatically, and I should be able to print this without *too* much effort. B-but I don’t---  understand, what is the *purpose* of this document?” 

Okin froze. He *knew* if anyone read it they would question it. He let his eyes wander around the shop again to avoid looking directly at the man.

“It--- It is to corroborate evidence backing up a claim made in the first text, and get people to discuss this... scholarly gap,” Okin could feel his cheeks heat up. 

“I...I see,” the elder man nodded. Part of Okin wanted to rip the papers out from the man’s hand and run out of the shop entirely.

The old man folded up his glasses and looked back to Okin. He smiled.

“Well then, we should be able to get these printed in the near future. The shop is a little behind schedule, but we should be able to get it done by--- next week.”

Okin’s eyes widened in surprise, and he smiled happily. 

“Thank you sir, that would be---“

“Say, are you from The Citadel, Ather?” The older man folded up the papers. “Not to be rude, but you look as if you’ve never seen a printing shop before.

“Yes, it is true. I am from Metheno, in Southern Whenran,” Okin smiled. “Once in a while we receive printed messages from newspapers in The Citadel or\[ 2021-11-27, 3:07 PM

“Ah. I have a friend who lives in Nolosk, a small town just west of the \[ 2021-11-27, 3:11 PM

Okin returned a smile and a nod.

“So you must be staying at one of the visiting complexes, I assume? Let me guess, Oktalus?”

Okin beamed, but shook his head. The man had guessed that he had stayed in the house of the God of Bravery. “No, I have actually not completed my Dedication of Bravery. I’m staying at Palno with my Rothar, Gendro.”

“Ah,” the older man nodded.

Okin poured out a few coins from the pouch “Uhm, how much will this be, sir?”

“Oh, it would be more than fine if you paid on return,” the man smiled. “Oh--- I’m sorry, Ather, I never got your name.”

“High Ather Okin,” Okin smiled. “And you?”

“My name is Tarvon, but everyone at the shop calls me Tarv. I know, it sounds so strange and primitive, and I have *no* idea *who* started it, but it stuck,” the old man chuckled.

“Well, thank you again, Tarvon,” Okin said. “I will be back in a week to pick up the prints.”

“Thank *you*, Ather,” Tarvon held out a wrinkly hand, and Okin took it with a smile. 

Tarvon would handle the printing, but now Okin had to get the actual text into the lap of the people and the clergy. How to do that in a time-effective manner--- without really getting stomped out by Aldwin, but *also* somehow without really going behind his back--- that was the issue.

Hopefully Ateon would have a solution for that.
