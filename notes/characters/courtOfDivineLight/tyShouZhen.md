## Background
### Aredal
Synodontis Ty-Shou Zhen is actually the Versalist hero/god Aredal, but in the year ! Revictus, fearful that Deionis was planning an attack after he resurfaced, murdered Intillia, and stole a golden weapon, plead Aredal to return from his voluntary exile in ! as the leader of Beisan to reunite the currently chaotic Marthia. Aredal only agreed if he could have his memories wiped, as his conscience could not bear returning to the mainland and manipulating the people.
### Mindwipe
Revictus informed Aredal that he would have his mind wiped and believe that he had a normal birth, to which Aredal agreed, but instead decided to give Aredal a more believable set of memories that would seem divine to Beisan and could arguably fit into the Versalist cannon as a reincarnation of the Versalist Aredal. The memories were carefully crafted by several Dark Heralds, as well as Architor and a team of other Heralds to make them more vivid and believable.

Ty-Shou currently believes that he was flashed down from the Light realm by Aredal to complete the process of uniting the world as per both the Beisanian and Versalist prophecies, under an Imperial and religious rule respectively. Practically, he remembers literally forming himself from pure Light at the same age he appears now, only a ! few years ago, with a full functioning mind and body, and extremely powerful Light Heraldry.

Aredal was also not aware that other controlled actors would be introduced to help him play his part. To make his arrival seem more divine and believable, Revictus also kidnapped several innocent peasant Beisanians and subjected them to the same Manipulation Heraldry that Aredal received, so that they would believe that they saw him purely form out of Light. Revictus also set up conscious actors not subjected to any Manipulation Heraldry as long-term puppets that would influence and control Ty-Shou when necessary, the primary ones being Wosa Nasa and Tao Lasa.
# Character
## Personality
Ty-Shou is rather reserved and contemplative, and can come across as melodramatic, though not without reason, given his unusal situation and massive responsibility. He is quite intelligent, but lets others speak first. He often feels like he is an alien on this world, and is confused. He is trusting and naive, but also a bit distant, as he knows he is categorically different then most.
## Goals
- To unite Marthia
- To make new friends
## Needs
- To realize he is Aredal
- To realize that the world is complex and often dark, but there is still meaning and hope
## Fears
- That his strange feelings are right, and he is actually doing something wrong and this isn't his destiny
## Ideals
- Peace
- Love
- Unity
## Conflicts
Synodontis knows that it is his responsibility and destiny to take over Marthia, but he is quite perturbed by all the violence and unsure of himself. He starts to see the role of Synodontis not as a gift, but as a burden, as he often desires things in a normal life, such as romantic relationships, friendships, and peace. 

# Abilities
## Heraldry
Synodontis, being Aredal, is the most powerful Light Herald in existence. He also has more experience than any other, and he is so powerful his powers often manifest in seemingly unique ways. He can destroy in entire regular army without moving. His main concern in combat is the collateral damage he will cause.
