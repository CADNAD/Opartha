| Coin Mole | 2 | Coin Moles can be assigned to sniff for either gold or silver coins underground. | N/A |
| Parrot (P) | 3 | Parrots are aerial units that can collect information about the state of the battlefield, and report back to the player. | \+: N/A \-: L  |
| Spear-Man (ST) | 1 | Stick-Men are bipedal ground units which have a long pointed spear. They are of low intelligence and will attack enemy units on sight, and cannot be instructed. | \+: B, R, DO \-: S, SH, F  |
| Sniper Snake (S) | 5 | The sniper snake is a long-ranged unit that can shoot a powerful stream of venom from its mouth. This venom will instantly kill Stick-Men or other weaker units. The Sniper Snake is quite fast, but also vulnerable. | \+: D, R, ST  \-: SH, DO  |
| Frog (F) | 3 | The frog is a medium-ranged unit which shoots a small spray of venom in a cone. It can jump high to hit aerial units, or reposition. It has very low health. | \+: SH, D, L \-: R, B, DO  |

| Shadowmaker (M) | 3 | Shadowmakers are the only unit that can protect others from the sun, which slowly kills them. They are of similar speed to Stick-Men, and can be told to follow one unit or a group of units. They cannot attack. |  |
| Shield-Man (SH) | 2 | Shield-Men are bipedal defensive units which have a front-facing defensive shell. They are very effective when leading in front of Stick-Men and Shadowmakers, creating a large, durable force, and their shells are immune to Sniper Snake venom. However, they can be easily toppled by Bulldogs, or flanked by Drophawks. | \+: ST, S \-: F, B, D  |
| Bullhog (B) | 8 | Bullhogs are powerful, quick units that can destroy several units with a single charge. They can be decent tanks, but are also dumb and will leave weaker units unprotected to chase a stronger unit. | \+: SH, DO \-: S, ST  |
| Drophawk (D) | 4 | Drophawks are aerial units which can pick up the rocks near the tent with their talons, and drop them onto other units, destroying weaker units including Stick and Shell Men, Shadowmakers, Sniper Snakes and Ravhounds in one hit. However, Drop Hawks are very straight flyers who do not dodge attacks and are easily countered by Sniper Snakes. | \+: DO, SH, ST, B \-: L, R, S, F  |
| Leechrows (L) | 1 | Leechcrows are very dumb and mostly serve to attack Drophawks and put pressure on parrots. They can be killed in one hit by any attacking unit. | \+: D, P \-: N/A  |
| Domesnapper (DO) | 3 | Domesnappers are extremely slow defensive units. They are best when in place, and do lots of damage with their strong jaws. They are very hard to hit. | \+: R, F, S, L \-: ST, DO, B  |
