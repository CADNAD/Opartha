* Chapter I
:chapterOneNotes:
Explain Farsun earlier. Probably around the first mention, so the reader understand the context of the war and the front.
:END:
"...and instill your Bravery in each of these men's hearts, every one, especially those of your Light, so that none may be deterred either by fickle emotions or the Vices of the One and the Five."
The square-faced man took a pause from his whispers. The flame sang a rhythym under his breathe. He remained hunched over with his arms raised in a reverent kneel in the corner of the room. His palms shouted to the ceiling above.
"And if I may ask again, that you may instill that same Bravery into my heart, not for my achievement, nay, but for my Arising to you."
His golden silk sleeves lowered from their raised position until his arms were clasped against his chest. His left index finger traced an invisible line over the back of his right palm, connecting to a line of golden paint already there.
"Bravery", he said under his breathe.
He raised his finger and brought it back in place to repeat the motion.
"Bravery."
Again, and again.
*SLAM!* The door, feet from him, smashed against the wall. The square-faced man jumped. He swung around. He raised his arms in an awkward stance; it barely intelligible that it was a defensive one.
:question:
where is Okin? is he in a small prayer chamber in the fortress?
:END:
They lowered, along with his wide eyes, as he noticed his intruder. From a violent shake, his body gradually stilled.
"Devinar Previa!" he said. "What is the meaning of this?!"
"S-sorry, Okin," an adolescent, crooked smile and slight blush appeared on Previa's face.
Okin shook his head. "I know your father taught you not to disturb a man during his prayers. So I must conclude that this is just carelessness on your part. And that's ATHAR Okin to you."
Previa rolled his eyes. "Since Krusadar Caldro is gone, I was more focused on maintaining the chain of command," he said. "You know me, it's hard to focus on more than one thing to remember at a time... and there's something much more important to remember than that."
Okin raised an eyebrow.
:comment:
maybe explain Previa and Okin's relationship a bit here. Call Previa a childhood friend or someting
:END:
"Maldin tracked the Farsunni who captured Islovol's squad. We're gonna get 'em back!" Previa's eyes lit up.
Okin's eyes narrowed on Previa. The young man's childish declarations always poked something inside him.
"That is Krusadar Caldro's decision to make," Okin replied. He turned back to the candlelit corner, even though he knew that it wouldn't be the end of the conversation.
Previa looked at the back of Okin's head with wide eyes. He stepped to the right so his shout was basically in Okin's ear. "They'll be killed by then!"
Okin's stare didn't flinch from the light in the corner. "As much as it pains both you and me, if they wanted to kill them, they'd be dead by now."
Previa shook his head. He turned away and opened the door again. "Every second we wait, is a second they're more likely to be killed by those monstrous heretics. If you're saying that, and they're still alive, then their blood is on our hands!"
Previa turned back to Okin. "Isn't it in Bravery that we risk our lives to save those that need us?"
Okin's lips pursed. His harsh stare softened, and his shoulders shrunk. *Bravery.* He felt his finger against the back of his hand again. *Bravery. Bravery.*
"No." Okin's sternness returned to him. "It is in Temperance and Truth that remain patient, that we get more information about the Farsunni outpost, and most importantly that we follow the orders of Krusadar Caldro to remain on the defensive."
Previa turned and ran like a petulant child, the door sputtering shut on his way out.
"Previa!" Okin shouted chasing his friend out the door and into the hallway. Previa was quick, and Okin just made out the end of the young man's leather boots turning down one of the fortress' stone brick hallways ahead.
Okin looked down to his unathletic rounders. He grit his teeth and made off, his awkward, intense strides being made by the softness of his rounders and flowing Athar's robes made him look comedic, and he knew it, but he had to catch Previa.
:comment:
Not sure what a rounder is, a shoe type?
:END:
As Okin turned down the hallway Previa had, the young man was nowhere in sight. His footsteps could be heard in the distance but the echo diminished. Still, Okin kept running, he knew where Previa was headed.
The Ather passed out from the stone halls into the fortress' central courtyard. Devinars in polished armour spared with each other or ran drills. Okin heard his name called in greeting as he passed. He gave the voices a slight nod as he tried to keep pace.
Previa had disappeared in the crowd, but Okin didn't need to see him. He passed through an arch way at the opposite end of the courtyard sprinting into the barracks. He passed the Krusadar's private rooms and the Devinar's dormitories. Pass the officer's mess and towards the armory used by Caldro's unit.
Okin's burst through the wooden door. Before even shoulder-checking it open, he could hear the clank of iron boots being fastened and swords being sharpened.
*THUD.* He burst through, before instantly grasping his forearm in pain. However, he was given no attention, the few dozen soldiers scattered around the benches were focused on hastily equipping their armor, and clammoring with a mess of different chants.
He was shoved aside by an armed soldier already leaving the barracks.
His eyes urgently danced around the room for Previa. The young soldier had armor like an alien quartz statue, shimmering with an austere beauty. It was not painted steel, but a material of its own, like a glowing pearl.
The row of soldiers marching out past him, the clanging of the iron boots, made Okin and shrink. He snapped at himself for his Cowardice, and straightened his posture before marching up to Previa.
"Stop them!" Okin shouted. Even with the commotion, he knew Previa heard him, though it was easy for the young soldier to pretend that he didn't with his visor totally hiding his face, and towering armor supporting it a whole head over Okin.
"I thought you said you wished to maintain the chain of command! I command you to stop them!" Okin got up next to Previa's shoulder and shouted upwards.
Previa turned, his blue eyes just barely visible as he stared down at Okin between the white visor. "And you always tell me that all men are truly ruled by the Four, and should be guided by their Virtues. So I am doing just that."
Previa fully turned and hilted his long steel sword. He tilted his head up so his eyes were gone, and again he was like a magnificent white statue. He took a step forward that shook the ground. Technically, maybe, Okin could keep standing in his way; Previa was the one going against command, and it would be a true crime to attack Okin, and Okin knew that though the adolescent was brash. But he could not do it, his instincts took over to step aside and let the moving white tower thunder past him.
After Previa had noticeably left the room, the rest of the men who were still inside the barracks rushed themselves and each other to follw him, clumsily putting on boots or still having their helmets tucked under their arms. Okin should've stopped them, he had the authority to, but was frozen, and could only let out small utterances.
He followed them out, stuck in between two armored men; he knew, on paper, they knew who he was, his Athar's robes told them that, and he had even counseled them before, but now they were locked into war, and he was just an object to get past. The collosal raindrops of their pounding boots drowned out his thinking; he didn't really know what he was doing, just that he had to do SOMETHING.
After turning down another hall dimly lit by torches, the white stream of the world burst onto him. Three hallways met upon a masssive iron door which had been pulled open, through which the stream of soldiers marched out of.
As he ran through, the soldiers behind him swarming past, Okin scrunched his nose at the kiss of the hot air. The soldiers climbed atop their horses, those who were ahead circled or doubled back and forth to channel the energy they were amping up. Okin looked around for an empty horse, but it seemed that just as he thought one was unreserved, it was taken. Finally, he just ran up to the group of trotting mounting soldiers. As he approached, their walks became more ordered, until they were totally circling around one figure in the middle, and it felt like a defensive shell against Okin. The figure in the middle was that white obelisk glimmering under the bloody morning sun, the mounted Previa.
Previa raised his fist. Okin froze, and the circle opened on the opposite side of the Athar, and Previa's horse trotted out ahead before stopping, the rest of the circle curving to line up behind him. Once they had, he turned his horse back to the squadron. He opened his visor, revealing his thin but energetic face, and raised his armored fist again.
"The energy in the barracks has been morose. We came here to FIGHT Darkness in strength in the open promise we made to The Citadel as Devinars, not slowly watch our friends die and be captured and hear that they burned down another village of our faithful, and capture our brothers, many of who you have been mourning. But-- you have mourned falsely. They are not dead. Now, here, is our chance to fulfill our promise! Open your visors, brothers! Let me see your smiles, let me see your passion!"
The men howled, and most followed and opened their visors. Okin understood the passion. Many of them had been dissappointed by the brutal, yet slow pace of the war; instead of glorious battles, it was characterized by ugly raids, by strategically sound but dishonorable uses of attrition. And though the enemy teased them by setting camps a mere ride from their bases, the message from high command was always to hunker down, prepare, and play the long game. But here, standing with his sword raised, was an opportunity for these young men to earn the glory they came here for.
"When you draw your sword today, men of Nexon, let me see your Joy! Men of Olitheon, show me your Sacrifice! Men of Intillia, show me your Discipline! Men of Aredal, show me your Bravery!"
Their swords sprung from their hilts, and their passion sprung from their hearts. Even though Okin was trying, in vain, to stop this, the strong summoning of brotherhood gave him, as it would any man, the urge to support this valiant effort, even when Okin knew it came from an otherwise forgetful, foolish boy-- in that white armor, on that horse, that boy was gone. A soldier, a leader remained.
"This is not some dishonorable raid, some backhanded pillage like those animals did to the innocent towns on our front! It is snatching our loyal brothers from the venomous jaws of Darkness! And if you are here to fight for your brothers, then RIDE WITH ME!"
Previa raised his sword again. The rest of the men did in unison.
"VIR VERSALIS!" The men shouted. "VIR CITADEL! VIR VOUR!"
"CHARGE!" The men hilted their weapons, then screamed and whipped their horses into a sprint. Previa raised his sword even higher to the sky.
Okin was thrust out of the moment-- he was here to stop this. But it seemed his chances were charging away towards the enemy camp.
:comment:
probably establish where the enemy camp is in relation. And they probably wouldn't charge from so close. Depends on the distance to enemy camp.
:END:
"Previa!" Okin shouted with his whole body just as the white-armored soldier had finally hilted his sword to join the rest of his charging army.
Previa stopped just as he was about to whip the reins of his horse. He turned around just as Okin ran up to his saddle-side.
"Okin?" Previa stopped and pulled up his visor. His face was mired with geniune concern and shock. "Get back in the bunker!"
"You have to stop them, Previa!"
Okin looked like a child next to the mounted Previa. Though Okin was almost a decade older than Previa, Previa stared down at him like a concern adult to a lost child.
"Even if I wanted to, it's too late. They would fight on even if the Mouth of the Gods showed up to stop them," Previa sighed. "But you do not want to be here when the enemies' riders and Portalers chase us to try to get their prisoners back."
"Previa--"
"Go inside, Okin. I'll see you later."
Okin stared at Previa. Part of him wanted to jump on the back of Previa's horse, or run back in and grab some gear. But then he looked down at what he was wearing, and his shivering body, and by the time he looked up again, Previa had already turned back to his charging army, and made off.


"Unacceptable!"
The mustached man's meaty hands slammed down on the stone table.
"But Krusadar, what I'm saying is right! We got Islovol's squad back, all alive! The mission was a success--"
"Did your mother make you out of dirt? That's the not the point! You disobeyed orders!"
"To save lives--"
"Do not speak over me, Devinar Previa!" The Krusadar rose to his feet. "You saved no lives. The Farsunni thought your attack was just the start of a proper raid, and sent out an entire company after you killed the original pursuit. To ensure that the entire front wasn't destroyed, the neighboring forts had to send out nearly half their men. We're now waiting on reinforcements as far back as Klivor, and there will be much more casualities than anticipated," the Krusadar's thick eyebrows stared down harshly at Previa, who looked down in embarassment. "You might've saved a handful of men, but you've doomed thousands."
Previa's hands clapsed the bottom of the wooden chair, and he rocked back in forth in it, his eyes glancing around to the drawn maps of the region on the walls, desperately avoiding the Krusadar's harsh, continuous stare.
"Now you, Athar," he turned to Okin. "I put you in charge of the men, despite your lack of military experience, as I wanted someone higher than a Devinar to be my substitute. I saw how the men respected your character. I hate to be wrong, but I was, wasn't I?"
Okin looked down. "You are right. I tried to bring order, but it was my lack of character that got in the way."
"Honest as ever, even when it hurts you," the Krusadar paused, his large hands clasped just under his wide chin. "But I cannot respect your lack of authority when I put you in charge."
"You are both hereby dismissed as acting service members of the Versalist military. Athar Okin, as we are equals, and as I assigned you to a post of which you would not normally be expected, you are merely released to go back to your regular town cycle or to return to The Citadel for reassignment. Devinar Previa, as you were the instigator of this unauthorized assault, as your commanding officer I am issuing a discharge and a description of this incident will be added to your permanent record. Any questions?"
Previa's head hung low. Okin just shook his head.
"Good. Now get out of my sight."


Okin stared out over the horizon which stretched across over the sandy mountains, where a light breeze created a pleasant translucent curtain of sand, the red sun comfortably veiled by both the curtain and its seat between two mountains. He appreciated the natural beauty of all lands he came across, and always thought to how each of the Four contributed. All gave an equally necessary contribution, but some he had an easier time than others understanding. Intillia brought both the earth, and the waters, and the gasses and winds in the sky; Aredal brought the Light for all living things to see by, through which this view would otherwise be impossible, and by it the heat which allows all living things to survive, and according to some of the newer Istars apparently, also the sustenance for plants; Olitheon, he could somewhat understand, brought the actual area where all things are, even the stars, but not the actual objects itself, those were still Intillia and Aredal. Him and Nexon brought many other things that were quite confusing. Okin tried to comprehend it abstractly on his own. He had even asked Istars in the natural sciences he met, though it made him uncomfortable, but still, he could not really comprehend it. Still, he trusted it and felt it in his prayers, which was what was most important.
:comment:
Is he uncomfortable because he is asking women?"
:END:
"I'm sorry Okin."
Previa interrupted Okin's tranquil observation, and brought him immeadiately back to his current air of disdain. Okin turned around and continued heading forward with Previa up the hill.
:comment:
They should probably be in carriage here or on horse back. Also, maybe it makes sense for them to travel with some baggage. Maybe mail? Or for them to take a space network trip back so we can establish the space network.
:END:
"That's Athar Okin to you."
Previa raised his hands, "Oh come on, Okin, we've known each other since we were kids--"
"That's Athar Okin to you," Okin's voice sunk like a swamp.
"Okay, okay, ATHAR Okin," Previa said. "So, uh, now that this all over, what's next for ATHAR Okin?"
Previa looked to Okin with the open eyes of a puppy. Okin ignored him.
"Come on, I know you have some plan in that big, meticulous brain of yours."
Okin's glare snapped onto Previa.
"This isn't nothing, Previa. I came here for a reason. To force myself to really JUMP into Bravery."
"You didn't come here to help the Citadel spread the holiness of the Four against the Corruption of the Farsunni heretics?"
Okin glared at Previa. Previa gave a sheepish smile, before sighing.
"This was important to me, too. This was a chance for me to grow in Bravery, and Temperance, too. I know how you feel."
Okin's glare softened. He waited for Previa to hoist himself upwards into the cart. Previa offered Okin a hand, but by then Okin was already himself getting into the cart, and he didn't take it.
:description:
Add some description here about the cart starting to move after they get it. Right now its a bit confusing
:END:
Previa collapsed against the side of the cart, and rested his cheek on his arm which he rested on the side of the cart. The cart bumped up and down against the cobbly road, and the young Devinar just let his face slide into his hand like melting wood.
"Well, if you have to know, I'm going to the Citadel. Probably to see Impalias Aldwin."
Previa sighed again. He stretched his arms and readjusted so his arms provided a cushion for his back against the cart.
"Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to go see dad too."
:style:
I feel like Previa would say father
:END:
Okin stared away from Previa, outside the cart. His eyes drifted, not on any of the dry yellow countryside, but past it. His mind was on what the future could hold, but it was just soft, meaningless impressions.
He raised the back of his hand into his gaze. The singular golden stroke shone in the Light. *Truth.*
He stretched his other index finger against it. He drew out an invisible stroke, coming out from the other golden stroke. *Bravery*, he said to himself.
He drew the stroke again, keeping his finger on it even as the cart jumped upwards and his whole body shook.
*Bravery.*

"Impalias Aldwin," Previa said. He bit his lip till it formed like a parted wave, and his eyelids covered his irises in a bored expression. "You know, *Impalias.* There's only like ten of them."
"Yeah, exactly, I know, *Impalias*," the bearded man shot back. "But for what reason on Opartha would a kid like you need an Impalias for? Or better yet, why would an Impalias take their precious time to meet with a kid like you?"
:comment:
Establish where they are at the start of the chapter. And some indication of who the breaded guy is.
Give time that it took them to travel to the citadel
:END:
"It's not for clerical duties, Virtues, or anything of the sort," Okin stepped in, already feeling enough embarrassment from Previa. "It's a personal matter. We know Impalias Aldwin personally."
"He's my father," Previa scratched the back of his neck and smiled sheepishly. The bearded man gave an unimpressed nod, and Okin scowled.
"Oh. Well, regardless, I don't really have anything to give you beside the common knowledge that the Impaliases spend most their time near the center of The Citadel," the mustached man grunted.
"Oh," Previa's smile faded. "Well, thank you anyway, and may the Four bless you."
"Four bless you too," the man said plainly before strutting away.
"Ugh," Previa shook his head. "Made myself look like an idiot, and I still have to have all this anxiety as we wait to find him. Of course some random Rothar wouldn't know where we dad is."
"Temperance, Previa, Temperance," Okin said.
"You know, it's not that I'm impatient, it's just that it's like-- it's basically like what's happening right now is the same as when I was a kid," Previa blushed, "...coming home to dad after getting in trouble."
Previa glanced to Okin, checking to see if his friend related, but Okin gave away nothing.
"Oh come on, don't tell me you never got into trouble as a kid? I mean come on, you weren't *that* stuck up and perfect, Okin," Previa raised an eyebrow at his own question, and then leaned closer to Okin. "You weren't, right?"
Okin just bit his lip.
"I coulda sworn I saw you got in trouble with one of the Istars," Previa rubbed his chin. "Yeah."
A slight smile appeared on Okin's face. "Your memory is better than I expected, Previa."
Previa matched Okin's smile with a toothy grin. "I knew it! I told Vashod you were one of us!"
Previa gave Okin a friendly slap on the shoulder, and Okin's smile faded. Previa chuckled a bit more, and Okin let it fade off into awkward silence between them, as the bustling of The Citadel to fill their ears. Okin and Previa both glanced around for a while. Though he was by no means a listless slacker, and Previa, though less conscientious, was definitely more filled with actual energy which caused a certain form of industriousness, Okin was surprised and with the Citadelian's sureness of movement, in a sea of other men, inches away from them, all on their own path and mission, they just stared straight ahead as if they were the only ones in existence. It reminded Okin of the preoccupation of wild animals, and in that way, it made the people feel less human, and though definitely more alive in some senses, less in others.
:question:
I don't understand what exactly you're trying to convey here. Is it just the hustle and bustle and energy of the city?
:END:
Okin cleared his throat before turning back to Previa and continuing. "But I liked your attitude on our trip here more than this distracted nostalgia. Now is a time to learn from what happened and look ahead, regardless of your feelings of shame."
Previa's lips pursed, and then he nodded. Okin often debated with himself whether Previa really took his advice to heart as best as he could and mostly suffered due to his own undisciplined nature, or if the lad just wanted Okin to like him and thus just tried to appear as if he was processing things. Okin's advice may have seem harsh, but it was the Truth, and he had given the same to himself, he had had to give the same to himself, after restless nights on the carriage, cursing himself for his failure in Bravery. He had replayed the events in his mind so much-- he should have stopped Previa, but after that, he should have had the Bravery to go out and fight, but he was not strong enought of fight his body. It had taken the week-long journey to even begin to lift the sham eoff his shoulders.
"Good advice, Okin," Previa said, but his focus was obviously on something else. Okin peeked over the young man's shoulder and saw what he was staring at-- a market stand where some young dough-faced boys were being handed a large, thick yellow pastry covered with thick sugars on the top.
"Well, you never said how far I should look ahead, and looking ahead about thirty feet, I see something very tasty--"
Okin sighed and shook his head. "Go ahead, Previa."
Previa smiled and ran forward a few steps, before turning back to Okin. "You want any?" he asked.
Okin shook his head no. "Temperance requires especially that times of personal dissappointment are not met with indulgence but with quiet, even uncomfortable, introspection."
Previa looked up in thought, and then took a step back. "You're right, I won't have any."
"No, no," Okin looked down. "I'm sorry, Previa. I'm probably coming off as a stickler. I didn't mean you shouldn't have one."
Previa's lips pursed. "Yeah, but, I feel bad having one if you don't. What about, I just get one, and we split it. It'll still cause me to do like, that introspection, 'cause normally I'd probably have-- well, two."
Okin laughed and shook his head again. "Oh, alright," he said.
Previa ran to the stand, excitedly exchanged some coins for the pastry, split it in half and handed it to Okin. The two enjoyed the snack as they kept along the large stone brick main road of The Citadel, towards the towering statue of Olitheon ahead.
"So, do you think," Previa said between bites, "that the Citadel will be able to beat Farsun and Surkusch without us?"
Okin bit into his snack. His eyelids lowered to say, *seriously*?
"I'm kidding. But I mean, in seriousness, do you think we'll win?"
"Well, the Onorun says we will encompass the world. We've beat them before, and they have less men then us, and they seem to be losing now," Okin paused. "So of course we will win."
"Yeah, but I mean like, when? Like you know, do you think we're living in... like, the Return?"
Okin's eyes narrowed, but his head was obviously spinning.
"Only a fool or a demagogue, will say, before the signs have come, that they are near, and therefore, change should be upon us."
"Neiman Seven, Eighteen Four," Previa finished with Okin in unison. Okin raised an eyebrow and smiled.
"But I mean... you've heard the rumors that there's a man in the East..."
"Enough," Okin said.
Previa nodded. Okin looked away to get his mind on something else. It was true that he did think of these things, but he trusted in that verse, and understood why it was there, not just to heed people against manipulative opportunists, but also for the sake of the ordinary Versalist's sanity. Though the Onorun ultimately foretold the events during and after the Advent as they lead up to paradise for all, Okin was still fearful that things would change too fast, that his lifetime would be derailed. But those were selfish, small-minded, unholy thoughts.
Okin looked forward as the already busy streets got more dense and noisy. Ahead, a large crowd had gathered, all within the shadow of the massive statue of Olitheon, which was being cast to the left. He and Previa stopped just at the edge of the crowd. Near the front of the crowd, low horns rumbled.
:comment:
Add a description of the statues or cathedral here. Or earlier in the chapter
:END:
"Dad should be serving near here... but this is an awfully large crowd just to get into one of his services," Previa said. "Still it is Olithday, so..."
Okin tiptoed to get a better view, and could see a large wooden pole peeking above the crowd. His stomach twisted. "I-I don't think it's a service."
"Let's get closer," Previa said as he started manuevering through the crowd. Okin squeezed behind him, uttering constant "excuse me"s and "sorry"s.
As they reached a few rows from the front of the crowd, Okin's suspicions were confirmed. He stared up at the wooden platform, upon which the large wooden hanging post sat. His throat squeezed up.
"Oh," Previa said as he also looked upon the wooden post. The Devinar's eyes bounced away to the group of men on the side, just next to the stairs where the post, coming out from the entrance of a large cathedral made of painted stone.
"There he is," Previa pointed to one of the men in the middle who wore robes similar to Okin's, but with purple stripes instead of golden ones. A large cape came out in an apron-like structure but split in the middle, outfitted with geometrical engravings. He was clearly the central figure of the group, being guarded by many heavily armed men.
:comment:
We can probably just say this is Aldwin here. Works better and makes Previa's line less confusing later.
:END:
"I think he's the one hosting this."
The horns, which had been playing a low, ambient rumbling, suddenly erupted. The man in the ornate robes marched onto the stage, surrounded by five guards all in different, unusual colored armor-- one was the same as Previa's, glowing with a softer version of the sun's glare, one a goldish yellow, one a crimson red, one a deep blue, and one a mix of several colors in a swirl, all glazed over with the same glow, shiny yet contained. They separated out onto different corners of the stage, except the one with the white armor. They grasped a thin dirt-faced man, pushing him forward, just behind the central robed figure.
"I'm gonna move back just a bit," Previa whispered into Okin's ear. "I don't want dad to see me and get distracted."
Before Okin could protest, Previa snuck backwards and the crowd moved forward to fill the gap. Okin's eyes returned to the thin man, shivering under the massive shadow of the armored white man behind him.
The horns erupted again, even louder this time. The robed man raised one arm, and there was silence on the other side of the blast.
"Olitheon bless you on his day," the robed man smiled. "Let us all, and especially those moving towards his heaven, be filled with his Virtues. Curiosity, Humility, Wisdom, and Sacrifice. We are standing under him today in more ways then one." the robed man looked up at the massive statue above, and there was some chuckles.
"As we observe our world, and our language, without the enlightenment of Versalism, we often see the opposite of Darkness as Light. This, while intuitive, is a Deception from the Darkness itself. It is a misunderstanding that creates an imbalance in our worldview and priorities. The reality is, that it is all Four, in balance, that stand in opposition to the Darkness. And today, as every Olithday, we stand in recognition of how Space works in opposition to the Darkness. In fact, it was the Wisdom of Olitheon which first saw the evil of Tregale, as well as the Sacrifice of Olitheon which saw to his banishment."
The white-armoured man threw the thin man against the post as the robed man continued his speech. The thin man groaned, and Okin could see that he was barely a man, moreso an adolescent.
"But even though Tregale's banishment prevented Darkness from taking over our world, the war against its evil was not finished, nay, the Gods desired that many things be spread to us, that we be a part of their mission so that we could join them in the Four heavens. That we all take part in the war against Darkness, and spread the Four rightfully across Opartha."
The thin man let out a moan like a pleading animal. He was silenced by a backhand from the white-armored man, which erupted in a squeal, and a pang in Okin's chest. Okin shielded his eyes.
:question:
What made the squeal?
:END:
/These are the Forces of Darkness... they seek to destroy Versalism, the Citadel, and the world... there should be no mercy for them, as they have no mercy.../
Okin looked back to the stage. The robed man pulled out a torch.
"Every destruction of the followers of the Darkness is one step closer to its total banishment, to the total arrival of the Four on Opartha."
The red-armored guard walked over to the robed man, lit his torch, and then stepped away. The robed man raised the torch high in the air.
"Vir Versalis!"
The robed man shouted, and the crowd erupted with him.
"Vir Citadel!"
Their shouts punched across the dense streets.
"Vir--"
FTSK! Several balls of fire sparked into large plumes of smoke near the stage. Screams tore through the streets, and Okin shielded his eyes.

Coughing. Screaming. The crowd crashed like restless waves. The central cloud of smoke consumed the platform. . The colored armed guards ran into the smoke. Okin knew something was happening... that his mentor and friend, and his friend's father, was under attack. But what would he do? He would get in the way of those who could actually defend. And the screaming, the smoke, the fear he admittedly felt but hated at the prospect of the thin man being burned... it was too much. Okin was taken up by the waves of the crowd. He surrendered himself into its waters.
But after running a few paces with the crowd, he had to turn back to the chaos of the central platform. A man emerged from the smoke. He was dressed as an ordinary urban peasant of the Citadel, in a long tunic of natural browns. But Okin knew the man was not just an ordinary peasant, he was the one who had created the smoke. Okin was some twenty paces past the man, with the crowd flowing in between them. The colored guards were stuck in the smoke, and it seemed that neither them nor the crowd noticed this man descending from the platform. Maybe this was his chance. His chance for Bravery.
Okin turned against the weight of the crowd. The shoulders moving against him bucked against his, but he stood his ground. Suddenly, Okin's gaze met the man's eyes. His  face was gaunt and scarred, more dark and weathered than most peasants in the eastern Versalist lands, though it was still obvious that this was a rather young man. But something in the man's eyes, a deep, fiery hatred, screamed that he knew Okin. And with that gaze, and some features of the man's face, and with the knowledge that that man had attacked the robed man, Previa's father, a thought coalesced in Okin's mind.

Coughing. Screaming. The crowd moved like restless waves. The central cloud of smoke consumed the platform. . The colored armed guards ran into the smoke. Okin knew something was happening... that his mentor and friend, and his friend's father, was under attack. But what would he do? He would get in the way of those who could actually defend Aldwin. The screaming, the smoke, the fear he admittedly felt and the hated at the prospect of the thin man being burned... it was too much. Okin was taken up by the waves of the crowd.

/Is that-- is it Cynin?/
And then, as it often does, Okin's mind exploded in panic. /He's a Herald. And he just killed Aldwin. And he's here to kill you too./
Okin dived back into the mass of the crowd and ran with it. He crossed shoulders with many people, hoping to lose Cynin in the sea of the crowd. He did not look back.
:comment:
Be more explicit about Okin's emotions. Because he turns back pretty soon after, it feels jarring as is.
:END:
Finally, the crowd slowed their movement, but Okin was still stuck inside its mass. It became clear to them that they had dispersed far away enough from the conflict, which seemed to not have escalated further. Okin, along with many of the others, turned back to the scene. Okin searched for Cynin, but he couldn't find him.
He pushed through, ignoring the murmurming and cursing. Reaching the edge, he ran back toward the platform. The smoke was still building, half covering the face of the cathedral behind it and half covering the bottom of the much taller statue of Olitheon to its right.
The guards had all descended from the platform. They were running to surround two figures on the ground-- it was Previa, with his father in his hands. Okin glanced around the entire intersection, and down the street him and Previa had come down before. Finally, he caught a man running to get on a horse. He wasn't certain, but was quite sure it was Cynin.
"It was him!" Okin shouted at the group of Devinars and colored armed guards, and pointed towards the man getting on the horse. "I saw him come out of the smoke!"
The guards took a second between them to decide if they trusted Okin, then nodded and ran towards the man on the horse. Okin watched them run towards Cynin. He could follow, but it was probably pointless for now, they would catch him or they wouldn't.
Instead, he turned back towards Previa, who was sitting on the floor. The young Devinar sobbed. Okin moved to the side to get a better view of the robed man, who was collapsed in his son's arms. Okin grimaced; Previa's father looked beyond old, like if a man kept growing after he was dead. The first thing Okin noticed were the offness of the man's colors, his hair was much longer than before but scraggly and twisted in  different directions, though it was gray before, now it was streamed in several uncomfortable shades of grey, his teeth were yellow, and his skin was also a whitish-gray. The man's gaunt hands lay motionless. His fingernails, colonized by dust and puss, were half as long as his fingers. His eyes were stretched open, and massive drooping bags contrasted against his now ghoulish skin.
"Dad! No, no, no, no!" Previa shouted and kept shaking his father. Previa held his father's cold face against his cheek. "Please! Oh Aredal!" He screamed up, but past, the massive statue above. "Oh Aredal! Give your Compassion to my father! Oh Nexon! Give him your Care!"
He screamed directly at the statue just above them, with both its palms outstretched as if it was holding a large ball in front of its chest, "Oh, Olitheon, on your day, if it is my father's final hour, I know he will be blessed in your heaven, but please, give him some more time on Opartha, please!"
Okin's heart wrenched at Previa's sobs. He walked close enough that Previa could see it was him and leaned down and hugged his friend.
"I'm sorry," he said. "I'm sorry."
Previa kept hugging his father's cold body close to his chest, but he leaned into Okin's shoulder to wipe his tears.
"Where'd they go!?" Previa stod and shouted. "WHERE'D THEY GO?"
Okin raised a shaky hand and pointed down the street they had come from. Previa's fist clenched and he stared off in its direction.
"Devinar Previa," Both Okin and Previa looked up to see the red-armored guard standing over them. "I'm sorry, but we have to clear the streets and get your father to a hospital."
Previa nodded and wiped his eyes. Awkwardly, he slid held out his father's limp body to the red guard and another guard in plain armor who picked him up by supporting his back and legs respectively.
Previa immeadiately jumped to his feet like an angry teenager itching to get into a fight. "You're sure he went that way?" Previa said to Okin and pointed down the street.
"Y-yeah, but--"
Previa wooshed passed Okin, nearly knocking him over. The Athar sighed. He looked up to the statue of Olitheon, some several buildings' height worth above, just as the smoke was clearing from his face.  His head was numb, the events that just happened felt unreal.
/Oh Olitheon, I am sorry for all the evils that happen on your day... in all your Wisdom, you are probably looking down on us and shaking your head. Please guide us. I know I am of Aredal, but please guide me... through whatever this is.../
"Athar Okin," Okin was brought out of his trance by a fully armored guard holding a long spear. "I need you to come with me."
Okin met the guard's harsh blue eyes. He nodded and followed the man down the circular road which surrounded the statues and large cathedrals in the center of the Citadel. They turned into one of the cathedrals with paint that looked like navy leather with vines of bronze stretching down and around it.
:comment:
It's fine for Okin to recongize the catherdal
:END:
The guard led Okin up a set of stone stairs into a small but fancy room, outfitted with custom wood dressers, and a petite table and tea set that one would think fit for a rich old lady. The guard motioned for Okin to take a seat and he obliged.
"We're just having everyone close to Impalias Aldwin and any other potential targets under watch for the time being," the Devinar said. "I hope you understand."
Okin nodded. "We'll keep you fed and guarded and notify you if we have any updates," the guard continued.
He gave Okin a curt nod before leaving the room and bounding down the stairs. Okin just stared out at the parially transparent window, sitting upright in the chair much too small for him. His eyes seemed to ponder nothing but the second floor of the stone building on the other side of the street. But though his eyes were still, his mind was not. /How did Cynin survive all this time? Had he been waiting under their nose, just waiting for an opportunity, or was he living far away? Was Damin still alive? Did Cynin want to kill Okin? Was it really Cynin, or was it just Okin's fears that were getting in the way? What will Previa do now? Is Aldwin dead? Who will be the next Impalias?/
His train of thought was interrupted by a knock on the door. His head whipped to it like a bird noticing a predator, and his fingers grew white against the table. The door squeaked open, and he readied his fists--
He lowered them in a sigh as a short old woman pushed open the door with her lower back. She gave Okin a kind smile and he got up to help her with the tray she was holding, a plate with a loaf of sugared bread and some tea.
"Thank you, Infantii", Okin smiled. He sat back down as she left the room, accidentally slamming the tea tray too hard against the table with his shaky hands. The tea in the cup jostled, just barely staying within.
:question:
Is infantii the persons name. Is this to esatblish that old ppl can be infantis?
:END:
Okin stared at the tea, which moved back and forth yet maintaining the top surface as a perfect oval, and the ever-so-slightly rattling cup. His eyes fixed on all the tiniest details, on the slight ripples in the brown water, on the chaotic triangles and small smudges in the leaf inside, to the little white specks quite natural for the stone the cup was made out of. His gaze shifted to the small loaf of sugared bread, running down the gradient from a soft yellow to a warm brown, over the distribution of sugar droplets. He sat down into the chair without moving his head, still focused on the treats in front of him. His stomach rumbled, but he didn't move a muscle.
Okin stayed like that, waiting, salivating, feeling the dryness of his own body, analyzing the snacks before him, as the same thoughts bounced through his mind. He didn't know how long he stayed there. Eventually he started to hear the rhythym of his own breathes.
The door squeaked open again. This time, two guards in the same steel armor, indistinguishable from the one who brought him in before, shifted and crouched to fit through the small wodden door. Okin stood to his feet to greet them.
"Athar Okin, sorry for the wait," the first one said, plopping down his visor to reveal a face marked by spotted dark hair, on both his beard and eyebrows. His eyes went to the plate of snacks, untouched, and back to Okin.
"Did you catch him?" Okin asked. His eyes went back and forth between the two guards, and he could tell the answer was no before they said it.
"No," the second guard, noticeable by a scar across his left eye, said. "He was assisted by another group of Heralds, one of them Teleporation, at the North entrance."
Okin scratched his chin. "And was there two of them? In the original party?"
"We were not in the pursuing party," the dark-haired guard said. "But the reports so far say so, that two individuals fled for the North entrance after Impalias Aldwin was attacked, though we also don't know exactly how many accomplices there were or what their roles were in their attack."
"And the criminal? The one of the Darkness? Did he get away?" Okin asked.
"His whereabouts are unknown," the scarred guard said. "But if you have any information about either him or "
"I believe the attacker was a Light Herald," Okin said without skipping a beat.. "And uhm, I believe he may have an accomplice who's... of the Darkness."
The guards looked at each other. Their jaws clenched, and it was obvious they were forcing overly unphased faces. The scarred guard nodded.
"Understood," The dark-haired guard cleared his throat. "Uhm, that is not the only reason we're here. We've been notified that it is unlikely that Impalias Aldwin will be making a recovery soon, Four bless him."
Okin gave a solemn nod, "Four bless him."
"And the Impalias noted you down as a replacement in case of his temporary leave, until an election can be held", the scarred guard said.
Okin's eyes widened. His heart quickened. "I'm just a junior Athar. I've only achieved Truth, and I-I'm only thirty! I am far too inexperienced to be an IMPALIAS!"
:comment:
Okin can note some other notable young Impaliai here. Or talk about the typical job age range
:END:
"It is the will of the Impalias, who's authority is willed by the Mouth, who's authority is willed by the Gods," the guard said.
Okin shook his head. "In Truth, I felt I did not even deserve the title of Athar. This-- this is a mistake."
"It is not like this is our decision," the dark-haired guard said. "We are merely the messengers. Though if Impalias Aldwin has selected you, I'm sure there was Wisdom in his judgement."
"I do not mean to insult a man I so dearly respect," Okin said. "But he has known me since I was a child. I'm afraid that nepotism has clouded his judgement."
:style:
Nepotism is prob a weird word to use.
:END:
"With all due respect, it is not my job to debate you or encourage you," the scarred guard interjected. "My job is to take you to the central chamber, to prepare for you duties as Impalias. We'll go through the Nexon chamber, if you don't mind."
Okin nodded. The dark-haired guard held open the door for Okin and the three of them left the building.
As they moved back onto the main central street, it was clear and clean yet bustling; one who was not here a few hours ago would not have known that the event nor the violent attack took place.
They turned into an arch set between the legs of two of the massive stone statues into a large building made of a dazzling quartz-like surface, also outfitted with green, orangle, purple, and multicolor gems. Inside, Okin awed at the series of massive paintings. They depicted men and women in different outfits, most of a simple and ancient nature, yet different in color and shape. Some were portraits, some were landscapes, some set in the austerity of cold winter, some ontop of a picturesque mountain sunset, some depicted battles, others depicted meals. Yet though everything of the environment was different, and though the individuals varied in race and appearance, it was not just the style--- which were of a romantic yet semi-realistic nature, with deep, contrasting colors ---that told the viewer that these people all shared something in common; there was an unspeakable quality among them, like they knew the people in the other paintings, or even that they knew that the other people were in the paintings that they were in, even though the events depicted were nations and times away from each other.
:comment:
Having a hard time visualizing the hall. Painting descriptions are good
:END:
As they left the hall wherein all the paintings, and walked the steps of a stone spire, Okin's lungs squeezed inside his chest. Here he was, in the most powerful and holy complex in the world, about to be inducted as one of the most powerful leaders in the continent, after ironically being sent here by a failure. How could he tell the Council that he did not belong there? Surely, they would see that he did not, and it would all just be a quick, embarrasing moment to forget. It was Okin's dream to be here, in some ways, but no, because it just felt too distant. He remembered how he felt when Aldwin became an Impalias, how close it was to be so near to the heart of Versalism. And now, here, he was, and it felt surreal.
Okin stepped up to the exit of the claustrobic, dimly lit stair spire, and entered a tall, long hall with quartz walls set with topaz accenting that made long lines with swirling patterns at the end. Here, there were paintings as well, but they were all of one man, a figure who looked nearly identical to the statue of Olitheon that stood above them, with his narrow but still masculine face, tall frame, and long, pointy nose. Yet there was a quality different about him, mostly in his expression, which in every picture was a smile of some sort, both large, childish smiles, but also some soft smiles of an old friends appreciating each other in a quiet moment, as opposed to the kind yet serious expression on the massive statue outside. Like the paintings downstairs, these depicted the man in a variety of scenes; a few of the scenes had other individuals, but it was obvious he was the center and the throughline; In one he fought off four other figures, but it was him focused on the dominant side of the image, and the four on the other, and there were actually many with another man who looked identical to him that was no doubt the same man as the massive statue outside, Olitheon. In every artwork was composed to feel their closeness, and they both smiled, though the one that was not Olitheon always smiled brighter.
As soon as Okin had fully stepped in the room, and had more than a spare second to take in the exquisite air that the display created, he immeadiately joined the two guards in a line in front of a statue of the featured figure at the far edge of the room. At once, they all knelt on one knee.
"Nexon, God of Joy, God of Creativity, God of Peace, God of Care, God of Time, we permission ask that we be brought before your messenger on Opartha, the Mouth of the Gods," the two guards said. "We are returning his request for Athar Okin Santac."
For some moments, there was nothing, and the guards and Okin looked almost comical standing so reverently, almost hoping for a response from the statue, which was in a childish position, mid-jump. Then left of the statue, a man in light-armor stepped out from a line of four light-armored men in front of a narrow doorway.
"The Mouth has spoken. Permission is granted," his voice rumbled through the hall. He stepped back into the line, and then the line broke and folded so that pairs of men were facing each other. Okin and the two guards stood up from their position, and Okin noticed that on the right side was an identical line of guards, but unbroken, except these were heavily armored in the identical armors as the ones who were guarding Aldwin when he was attacked on the platform, except the white one was missing. Okin followed the guards through the left side, between the two pairs of men.
/How powerful must these four Heralds be? They could probably take down a whole army of their own.../
As they reached the top of the staircase, Okin's mind spun in a million directions. Here he was, about to meet the most powerful, holiest man in the Citadel, the direct leader of all Athars like him. Once they finally got through the doors, Okin's panic was only stopped by one fact: he expected the central chamber to be /bigger/. The room was nice, no doubt, not too cluttered or ostentatious; each priceless material was placed with intention; on the opposite side of which they came out elegant emeralds encapsulated a set of paintings, the largest and central being that of a dark-haired, angular woman with foreign eyes. There were two paintings on either side of her, one man and one woman on each side, of different builds and skintones; next to that entire set was another, this one surrounded by rainbow gems. The central figure in this one was another foreign-looking man with yellowish skin, jet-black hair, squinted eyes, a strong jawline, and a kind smile.
:comment:
Who is the women? Is it Intillia? I'm confused who the paintings next to the women are supposed to be
:END:
As he looked at each piece, Okin realized, as almost all men did when entering, that in fact his expectations were wrong, that the room was perfectly sized, that it had the symmetrical beauty both for form and function, and that every item within had itself the perfect amount of positive space it filled and negative space around it to shine itself and complement the items around it. That the closeness would remind the people within that they were sitting on top of an organized, holy order, where everything is already in its place and that they must act with total Wisdom to ensure its perfection.
:question:
who is saying the dialouge after this? I don't understand what it means 
:END:
"I'm gonna have to extend my nighttime prayers by two hours today. Being the plainest thing in the room for years has caused me some Envy," Okin's wandering eyes found a man sitting directly ahead of where they had entered, on a chair in the round red wood table in the centre of the room. He wore a hat shaped like a diamond, with one of the tips ending right above his nose bridge. His robes were puffy, and four lines of equal measure streamed down the sides, green, orange, purple, and multicolored. He had a variety of jewelry, including four brooches on top of his hat, and a large necklace with sixteen gems.
He gave Okin a bright smile. Okin knelt immeadiately, and only noticed after that the guards already were.
"We'll leave you to your privacy, Holy Mouth of the Gods," the guards said, before exiting back down the staircase in which they came.
The Mouth of the Gods nodded before standing. He stepped forward, still with a mischeivious smile, almost like a teen asking /Am I doing it right? Do I really belong here?/, before shaking Okin's hand. Okin locked in the shake for a long time, probably too long.
"Why so nervous, Athar Okin?" the Mouth asked.
"Well-- only handful of clergy even meet you, Holy Mouth of the Gods," Okin said. "And here I am, barely thirty, only having achieved Truth, and hearing that I am going to be inducted as an Impalias."
"Sometimes... a thing does not profit from immediately receiving what is already finished," The Mouth of the Gods smiled with his cheeks. "Sometimes, it is not the beginning nor the end state of a being that the situation needs, no, it requires the process, the effect created by the transformation itself. I believe that may be the relationship between the Citadel and you."
Okin's slow nods betrayed his confusion.
"It is good that we have someone so young, and going through the beautiful journey of pursuing the Virtues, among the High Council now," the Mouth of the Gods said.
"Well, it's due to tragedy that I am here, so I hope it's not too long."
"I assure you we will have our best on the case for the investigation of this terrible event. But enough of that Pessimism. It brings me Joy that you are here," the Mouth motioned for Okin to take a seat. "I always love to meet new people. I /see/ new faces, but to connect to someone new, to grow with someone, like I get with the other Impaliases... it is rare. It is quiet here in the central chamber."
"Well, I hope you can understand-- I hope I am more than a face, but as I said I still hope that it is Aldwin here growing with you soon, and not me," Okin gave a tight-lipped smile before siting down.
"Of course," the Mouth nodded, and took his original seat. He cleared his throat and brushed some dust off his robe. "Devinar Aktro! Please will you bring me Athar Okin's things now?" He shouted down one of the corridors.
:comment:
Maybe these guards should be Krusadar
:END:
Heavy footsteps echoed through the hallway in response. A massive man, armored in the same kind of white shiny armor as Previa had worn before, walked up to Okin and presented a set of jewelry ontop folded robes to him. Okin received the package with open palms.
"I apologize we don't have time for a formal ceremony, though if you really want one it can be arranged," the Mouth said.
Okin shook his head, "There's not a more respectable place I could be." He felt the warm touch of the linen filling his palms.
The Mouth smiled. "You have more Humility than many of the Athars of Nexon." He stood to his feet again and hobbled over to pick up a staff leant against the wall. The staff reflected a soft light from the chandelier above, its body satin and subtle. He rose the tip which formed from four arches that stretched out from the body and created a hollow center where a large orange Crystal shimmered.
"I'm always casual, but the Citadel requires that you kneel. And you've seen how tough its walls look," the Mouth chuckled.
Okin fell to his knees and placed the folded clothes in front of him. He raised his palms to the ceiling, in the same position that he always prayed in.
"Athar Okin Santac, do you recognize the Truth of the Versalist world, and claim yourself as part of it?"
"I do," Okin spoke with a measured voice.
"Do you recognize that the Citadel is the center of the Versalist world, and out from it the holiness and the authority of the Gods dissapates across Opartha?"
"I do."
"And do you recognize that I am the Mouth of the Gods, and from my Mouth the will of the Gods is given?"
"I do."
"And as a member of the clergy of the Citadel, have you dedicated your life to the Gods and the Versalist world, but heard the calling of one of the Four?"
"I have."
"And which of the Four is that?"
"Aredal."
"And do you understand that Impalias Aldwin of the Citadel, who receives his authority from the Mouth of the Gods, who recieves his authority from the Gods themselves, his called upon to be his replacement as one of the holy ten Impaliases of the Citadel in a time of need?"
Okin froze. His eyes travelled upwards to meet the Mouth of the Gods'. /I understand, but I don't agree. There's thousands of other Athars, older and holier than I, who should be taking this decision. Every night I will be up praying that by some miracle of Light Heraldry Aldwin instantly recovers. I shouldn't even be here, I was only planning to be here for a week to get reassigned./
The Mouth of the Gods looked at Okin expectedly, and lowered his staff until it brushed Okin's hair. The ocean of concerns almost flooded out of Okin's mouth.
/What an act of Cowardice it would be now to whine like a child about my fears./
Then, his voice shaky yet determined, he delivered.
"I do."
The Mouth smiled, "Then as the Mouth of the Gods, he who proclaims the will of the Four on Opartha, I declare you Impalias Okin Santac of Aredal."

** Chapter
Aldwin's manor was in the Nexon quarter of the city, nestled between two townhouses. Okin had visted the home manor before, but it had a different air about it now that he was the Impalias-- he felt he actually had the permission to look around.
The manor was a two story house, surrounded by a well-kept garden. The manor had enough room to house the Impalias of Whenran, his family, and few select servants. The remainder of the staff would likely live in the same quarter, in the many town houses and low lying apartments of the Citadel.
Okin had been escorted from his meeting by the three guards: one in crimson red, one in golden yellow, and one in deep blue. Three of the guards who had failed to protect Aldwin. The only words the men had exchanged with Okin were to inform him that the last two guards were watching over Aldwin's body. Okin didn't blame the men for their silence.
Lights shone out of the window as Okin approached the manor. In the drive way up to the entrance, stood a man and a women. They each wore the uniform of an Athar and Istar respectively.
"Impalias Okin!" The woman said. She was a short middle aged woman with the blue eyes, almond brown hair and pale peach skin of a Nairfalkian. Her hair was cut in a straight bob that framed her round face. 
"I'm Othar Amesa, and that's Athar Gendro." She said pointing to the taller man behind her.
:comment:
is she othar or istar
:END:
"There is no need for that," Okin said, quickly trying to wave the pair off.
"We insist, Impalias," the man, Gendro, said. Okin couldn't place the man's ethnicity, but his curly black hair indicated he was from one of the central provinces. Based on his long face and plump cheeks, Gendro was young for an Athar, not much past Okin's age.
"Come, come, we have so much to catch up on." Amesa practically shoved Okin down the drive way and into the manor's two story entry hall.
"Wh- where are we going?" Okin asked.
"To Aldwin- I mean, to your study," Amesa led Okin down a hall on the first floor towards the back of the manor. They passed busts of the previous Whenran Impaliases and oil paintings of the Gods, till they reached the study at the back of the manor.
The study was obviously not designed as such. It was awkwardly large, and had a glass door that led to a conservatory. A huge oak desk set to Okin's left, and behind it a painting of Aldwin and a young Previa. The room was crowded with at least fifteen other staff members of all ranks. The collective turned to Okin as he entered, and silence fell over the room.
Okin could feel Gendro looking between the crowd and himself silently. Okin's heart skipped a beat under the weight of those eyes.
"This is Impalias Okin," Amesa said after a long pause. "Impalias, meet your aides."
"It is an honour to meet you all," Okin said.
There were murmurs of agreement amongst the crowd. Gendro motioned for Okin to take a seat at the head of the oak desk. The Impalias took the seat silently. Gendro, Amesa, and the three guards--- now without helmets ---filled in after.
His aides seemed to be from all over the Versalist World. He had heard most Impaliases recruited exclusively from their home province, but only half the assembled aides appeared to be from Whenran.
"The first order of business is ensuring the Impalias is prepared for tomorrow's meeting," Gendro took a place at the side of Aldwin's desk.
An Othar stepped up to slide a piece of paper across the desk. "I have this week's Registir here. I just updated it this morning, it's all the same topics as last week."
Gendro gave the Othar a solid nod as she handed a second copy to him, then another to Amesa.
"No, I have a more pressing issue," Okin said. All eyes in the room once again went to the new Impalias.
"Impalias Aldwin was attacked today." Okin paused. He hung the silence long enough for the assembled aides to begin to nervously shift. "We can not let this go unpunished. I want to assemble a task force to hunt down the two attackers."
Okin paused, wondering if he should reveal that he knew the attackers personally. He had already told the two Devinar about Cynin and Damin, if it would tarnish his image there was nothing Okin could do to stop it.
"It was an orchestrated by a man by the name of Cynin Gruissem. Aldwin knew him as a child, but some old grudge seems to have driven the man to his attack."
There were gasps amongst the crowd.
"The man is dangerous, and armed. I won't force anyone to go after him, but I need Brave men and women to pursue this assassin."
The crimson red anti-Herald guards stepped up. Okin put out a hand to stop the man.
"I have a task for you three already."
The guard's jaw visibly tensed as he bit back a retort.
"I want you to gather the White Knight and go after the escaped Dark Herald. They are the most pressing issue. We can not allow a rouge agent of Darkness to be free within the walls of our hallowed Citadel."
The guard still seemed annoyed, but nodded his head in understanding. "After you capture the Herald, you can transfer to lead the search for Cynin Gruissem."
The man gave a slow nod, "it will be done, Impalias."
"May the Four bless you."
"And you Impalias." 
The three anti-Heralds exited the room with their task as Okin read the Registir over. He had learned what the Registir was during his training as an Athar. It was a list of all the issues and disputes from over the Versalist world which the Impalises worked to resolve in their weekly meetings. The Mouth controlled the flow of issues. He had the power to decide which issues were discussed in each meeting, and the power to take any topics off the Registir.
The list had twelve items on it, some of which he recognised. /Troop allocation on the Western Front, Versalist presence in Marthia, Space Guild rate negotiations,/ and various requests by high Othars to fund their research projects. Some were ones that would be solved within a week. Others were debates that might've gone on past his life time, and would only change in name.
Two items caught Okin's eyes. /Funds for a new Terellian shipyard/, and /Wolstamm food shortage/, "Are these all real?" Okin asked.
Gendro nodded, still reading over the paper.
"There's a food shortage in Wolstamm? No one's said anything about it? How could they not?" Okin felt himself rise from his chair.
"With all due respect Impalias, you were on the front," Gendro replied.
Okin glanced at Gendro.
"How did you know?" Okin asked.
"Impalias Aldwin thought quite highly of you," Amesa said with a fond smile. "He made sure to keep tabs on you and young Previa."
Okin nodded, that made sense.
"But news that big, it must have travelled to the front. Wolstamm is less than a day by Portal, and only a week or two ride by horse. Plus this news of a new naval shipyard? How many ships do they plan on needing?" Okin said.
"Fifty ships," an Athar in the crowd said. Okin blinked. That would be doubling the size of the Navy.
"Fifty?" The room nodded in response. "How long would that take?"
"If they approve the new ship yard, a decade. If we invested all excess resources from the region into it and brought in wood from Whenran."
"So Aldwin... opposed this?" Okin asked. Aldwin had mostly supported the Army since it was inducted into the Versalist world.
Gendro and the aide both nodded.
"What about the food shortages?" In his lifetime, Okin had never heard of a food shortage in the province. Wolstamm was said to be one of the richest provinces. It had been the bread basket of the army since it was brought into the Versalist world, and contained a great wealth of minerals. It was said that the mills of Wolstamm never stopped spinning.
"It was a particularly bad harvest," a third, new aide, explained. "In addition, two brigades of Surkusch cavalry raided the country side for months before Impalias Volmunst could gather the troops to fight them off."
Okin looked at the aide, and his mouth widened.
"How did I not hear about this? I was on the front. If two brigades of cavalry had crossed into Wolstamm, we surely would have been mobilized."
Out of the corner of his eye, Okin saw Gendro biting his lip.
"We think you should avoid this topic tomorrow," Amesa said.
"Why?"
Amesa hand clutched the folds of her skirt. "There are... dynamics and alliances built on years of disagreements which we simply couldn't teach you by tomorrow's meeting, even if we tried. And this issue was a particularly sore point for many of the Impalises."
Okin took a deep breath. There were ten more issues on the Registir, and he was sure he had missed a hundred details. He was in so far over his head that he had no hope of breaking the water's surface, even with his great memory.
"What can you teach me by tomorrow?" Okin asked with a shaky breath.
"Enough," Gendro said.
Amesa waved an Infantis over, "get refreshments for the Athar. Tea or coffee, Impalias?"
"Tea please," Okin said with a smile. "And crackers if you have them."
The Infantis nodded and ran off.

The sun was beginning to rise over the Citadel's inner most wall by the time the briefing had concluded. There was doubtless details the briefing had missed, but Amesa had declared that Okin needed rest and had dismissed the staff of aides. Amesa herself had left not long after. Now only Okin and Gendro seemed to remain in the manor.
"Shall I have your lunch brought to you before you leave?" Gendro said as he followed Okin up the main hall's grand stairs to the second floor.
"No, no, I'll take it in the main dining room before I leave."
Gendro nodded, "the guest bedroom is at the end of the hall, on your right. I can have the Impalias' bedroom made up if you wish."
"The guest bedroom is fine. I am a guest after all." Okin paused pondering a question he had been holding since he had first arrived.
"So what are you and Amesa's roles?"
Gendro's eye brow raised, "I'm your personal aide, Impalias. Amesa is your head aide, and head of staff. I'm sorry Impalias Okin, I had assumed that you would be briefed on your staff prior to your arrival."
Okin shook his head, "it was a fair assumption."
Gendro made a small grunt of affirmation.
"Goodnight, Impalias Okin."
"Goodnight, Athar."
Okin pushed the door to the guest room open and collapsed against the door once it closed. He brought his knees up and began to cry. Alone in his mentor's home, the Impalias cried until he had no tears left.

This could be a chapter break tbh
:END:

"Aredal, God of Truth, God of Compassion, God of Bravery, God of Temperance, we ask permission that we be brought before your messenger on Opartha, the Mouth of the Gods." Gendro and Okin knelt in front of the chiselled statue of Aredal. One of the guards at either side of the Okin signalled them through double doors at the end of Aredal's cathedral.
"I'll be waiting for you here," Gendro said as they passed through the doorway and onto the same spiralling staircase Okin had taken less than a day ago to see the Mouth of the Gods. "Aides and guards aren't allowed in the chamber. But it's customary for us to walk you up."
A hundred or so steps up a hall way split from the staircase into in to an antechamber. Even in a simple antechamber, there was overwhelming detail in the brick work. No face was unordained. A small window in the ante chamber looked down upon the interior of Aredal's Cathedral.
"I leave you here, Impalias Okin," Gendro tipped his head and Okin returned the gesture. As Gendro left, another party crested the staircase. The Impalias at their head was easily identifiable as Impalias Henard. The man stood tall despite the age apparent in his greying hair and wrinkled, square face.
"Impalias Henard," Okin nearly dropped to the ground in respect before catching himself. 
"I see the new Impalias is here," the man's baritone voice was tinged with a rough gravel edge.
"It's an honour to meet you."
Henard had been one of the men Okin most admired and most strived to base his own life on. A paragon of Truth and Virtue.
"And it is an honour to have you amongst us young Okin." Henard said. He had the same soft fatherly smile of Okin's own father. Okin understood why so many over the Versalist world has sought the man out for guidance. "A fresh set of eyes and ears have always done the Impaliases good. It takes many perspectives to fully reveal the Truth."
Okin nodded, focused, absorbing every word. The mention of Truth spurred his heart, as it always had-- it was the Virtue he felt most confident in.
Henard stared at Okin waiting for him to speak. The young Impalias dared say no words. Moments later, Henard let out a hearty laugh at Okin's silence.
"Come, I'm sure they're waiting for us already." Henard walked past Okin to the double doors at the antechambers far side. The chamber within was circular, and silent. Eight men sat around a large circular table. Behind the table was an ornate cushioned chair.
Okin let out a silent gasp at the sight. Before Okin had learned Temperance, he had dreamed of being an Impalias. He had dreamed of living in the manor and of making policy and directing the Versalist world.
Henard motioned to an empty seat between the Impaliases of Monasque and Golzen, and Okin took it.
"I am very sorry to hear about Aldwin. He spoke of you well," The Impalias of Golzen said. He was a fit man, even into his late sixties, and handsome. The Impalias sported a bald head and curling gray mustache.
"As am I," said the fat man at Okin's other side.
"I thank you, Impalias Mikeol," Okin said, turning to the bald man. "And you, Impaliases Vovaq. Your condolences mean a great deal."
The Impaliases around the table took turns offering their condolences and introducing themselves. It was only after all had gone that the Mouth of the Gods entered the chamber. He wore the same robes and pointed that Okin had seen yesterday. He gave subtle waves and nods of greeting to the Impaliases as he passed to sit on the ornate chair at the back of the chamber.
"Shall we begin?" The Impaliases around the table nodded in response.
"The first issue we shall discuss is..." The Mouth looked over the Registir squinting. "Let's begin with a light issue. I would say it's for our new recruit, but we know that it's really me that needs the easing in," the Mouth smiled, and a few of the Impaliases chuckled. "Othar Julesh has requested we approve a new sub-committee to research what she calls /flintlock/ muskets. She claims that they'll be a marked improvement on our current matchstick muskets. Impaliases?"
There was silence for a moment before Impalias Ovolo of Farsun, Grand Marshal of the Western Armies, spoke. "I believe the idea to be solid. We have reports of Sirkusch's calvary using such weapons to great effect."
Even in their chairs, the Grand Marshall cast a shadow over the room. He was not the most handsome, but there was not a stain on his broad shoulders, and his groom was cut short and perfect, giving his hawkish face two sharp peaks. He was one of the youngest Impaliases ever, elected when he was thirty-four. The old Grand Marshal had been ousted after the early years of failure in the most recent war against Farsun and Sirkusch.
"Why can the Council of Advancement not manage such a project with their own resources," an old man's voice croaked out opposite from Ovolo, Impalias Levinor. "We've given them more than enough to accomplish such a task."
"She claims that the best way to acquire them is to buy a shipment from Apathasaw. A deal she can't make without our approval," Mikeol said, leaning back in his chair. "I personally think we should allow her to negotiate with them. If she manages to find a way through the Kaihani pirates to get our shipment, then that solves us all some headache, and its buying a single product to possibly increase the effectiveness of our entire army."
There was a series of nods from around the table.
"The only solution to the Kaihani pirates is to increase our naval outreach," a shorter man on Okin's side of the table said. Groans came from a select few Impaliases.
"Not everything is about your damned Navy!" A high-pitched voice yelled.
"Maybe it should be," the shorter man replied.
Okin searched for the high-pitched voice and found it had come from a hulk of a man to Okin's right. Even sitting, he clearly towered above the other Impaliases, including Ovolo. He had a short mustache and beard, scattered with trimmed but thick, rough hairs, and a few greys showing a mix of vitality, experience, and roughness. A huge scar cut across his left cheek and nose, ending a hair away from the man's right eye.
The Mouth waved them to silence, "we will get to your proposal later, Impalias Mathelin. Please. Focus."
The shorter man barely bit back a word of protest at the Mouth's command, leaving the hulk of a man with a satisfied smile.
"I vote in favour of forming this subcommittee," a man with hair braided in two strands said. The braids began at the hair line and divided the scalp in thirds. The Impalias had smaller thin eyes and a pointed chin.
"I agree with Impalias Ricartotten," Mikeol said. The other Impaliases all gave their support until it was only Okin and Mathelin left.
"I, uh..." Okin's eyes darted between the other Impaliases. Their faces were relaxed, almost unreadable. "I support this motion. I see no reason to reject an earnest proposal made in Curiosity."
Mikeol patted Okin on the back, leaning in to whisper. "Well said, young Impalias. Be not intimidated, we are all equals here."
Okin nodded slowly. Those simple words were somehow comforting and nerve-wracking all at once.
Mathelin gave an over-dramatic sigh, "Fine. I agree. Let this motion be passed."
"Let this motion be passed," the Mouth repeated as he made a mark on his copy of the Registir. "I suppose Mathelin would like to discuss his proposal?"
Mathelin stood without prompting. "Yes, I would like to propose that we commission an additional shipyard to prepare for the planned expansion of our navy."
Okin could see the hulk of a man roll his eyes, as did Levinor. The room was still aside from them, as if encased in amber.
"No protests? I suppose we shall move to approve it then?" Mathelin's face shifted as a smug grin came onto his face.
"How many ships are you building?" Okin blurted out. He hadn't meant to speak out of line, but still didn't believe the figure his aide had given him.
"He wants fifty, he's getting zero!" The hulking man's high pitched voice yelled out, causing a quiet chuckle from around the table.
Mathelin wheeled on the man, "you have such a strong opinion, do you, Volmunst?"
"You're putting the cart in front of the horse is all," Volmunst shrugged. A murmur of agreement came from the crowd.
"Impalias Volmunst makes a wise observation," Henard said. "How do we know if we truly need these ships and this ship yard?"
"Any man can see it," Mathelin scoffed. "Apathasaw is becoming a more and more important nation by the day. The Kaihani become more aggressive with each turn of the leaves. Our colonies are thriving in the South. How are we to protect our interests abroad and spread Versalism if we are limited to the land?"
Another wave of agreement.
:comment:
I am confused here. do you mean disagreement?
:END:
"You already got fifteen damned ships last month, and still decided to just repost this issue to the Registir. Shouldn't we at least see your grand plan for ourselves before we go dumping resource that could be used /elsewhere/ into your project."
:comment:
seems like something's missing here.
:END:
"What would you propose instead?" Mikeol said.
"I purpose we move to an issue that's actually pressing to our people. The food shortages in Wolstamm."
"Of course you wish for us to shield your own province from your mismanagement," Mathelin threw the comment into the crowd with a casual roll of his eyes.
"My mismanagement?" Volmunst said in a quiet tone. Okin instantly understood why he was to stay away from this topic in the meeting.
Volmunst rose to tower over Mathelin. Mikeol let out a small whistle from Okin's side. "Krusadars, what else can you expect," he said.
"Was it my mismanagement that allowed 6,000 mounted men and horses to cross the Strait and land in Wolstamm? Was it my mismanagement that allowed those two brigades to slip past the first and second army and into the heart of Versalist territory?" With that lat comment, Volmunst turned to Ovolo. "Was it my mismanagement that kept me here for weeks, discussing the budget for these new ships and rate hike contracts with the guilds? Weeks that prevented me from rallying my own men and riders to repel a force which should never have gotten so far in the first place!"
Volmunst slammed his fist on the table, causing the whole table jump.
"Impalias Volmunst, that is enough! Back to your seat," the Mouth roared. "We will maintain the sacred order of this meeting." 
"I will not yield!" Volmunst yelled. "My people are starving, /dying/! Wolstamm has given everything the Citadel has ever asked of it. We arm, house, and feed the righteous forces of Versalism. Two hundred years of the Citadel asking my people to turn their farms to mines. Wheat mills to steel mills. Bakeries to forges. My people have given all for the good of the war, for the good of the Citadel. Yet you ask us to invest in shipyards, missionaries, and more Devinars!?"
Okin shied away from the man's passionate speech.
"All I ask is a tax on your harvests, to be help feed the army and alleviate the pressure on my people," his voice shook this time, and Okin thought he saw wetness in the massive, rough man's eyes. "What Charity do we have if we let our people starve?"
There was silence in the room. Volmunst looked each Impalias over slowly till he made eye contact with Okin. There was a plea in his eyes clear as day. /What would Aldwin have done? Surely, he would have helped the people in need. Whenran could afford to sacrifice for the good of all Versalists./
"I support this motion," Okin was the first to say.
"As do I," Mikeol said with a grudging sigh.
Another round of silence before Henard spoke, "Volmunst speaks to Truth. We have asked much of the people of Wolstamm. If they can not support themselves, then we will fail to support our own Army. There is Wisdom in this decision. I agree."
The others slowly agreed until only Ovolo and Mathelin remained.
Ovolo ran a hand through his combed hair. The man chewed on his decision, slowly running it over. "It's true the army does need more food. I will agree if Impalias Mathelin does. As I hold no land, it is improper of me to make a decision on your behalfs."
Mathelin had cowered from Volmunst's rant. He had slipped silently back in his chair and had allowed his wavy hair to fall over his eyes. As he began to speak, Okin could see his hands visibly shake.
"I... I understand Impalias Volmunst's concern," Mathelin gripped his hands into fists. "But we have a careful balance--," He paused and glanced over everyone, except Volmunst. "Who's to say this food tax won't ruin us all?"
"Mathelin," Henard spoke with an even voice. "Do you not know Sacrifice? We all know the Truth of the matter. Terellia can afford to share its bountiful harvests with its brothers and sisters."
Okin could see a line forming between the two Impaliases as Mathelin glared at the older man. Henard's face held only a soft, nearly condescending smile. Mathelin bristled, but did not back down. There was an internal order to which the Impaliases seemed to all defer to, if not respect
"I. Approve. This. Motion." Mathelin practically spit each word out. Henard tipped his gray head with a satisfactory smile. Volmunst gave Okin and the others a respectful nod.
"A second issue, resolved," the Mouth said with a heavy sigh.
Okin could tell today's meeting would be a long one.
* Chapter V
** Chapter
Okin sat in Aldwin's study, reading over a stack of reports from his aides. His head still hurt from the meeting two days prior. Okin had expected Impaliases to be composed and formal, he had expected the decorum to be overwhelming. The meeting have been much more casual and adversarial than Okin could have ever imagined.
Had Aldwin somehow kept order amongst the Impaliases? Okin had gathered, from Amesa and Gendro, that Aldwin had been somewhat of a leader amongst them. /Of course he was a leader, anyone would know to respect Aldwin./ Okin did not feel similarly about himself. Previa and his Devinars had barely respected him when they were at the front, and those had been men that he worked closely with and advised: some had even come to him with their deepest spiritual fears. One that should have known the quality of Okin's character, yet they could did not respect Okin. And could he blame them? He was ten years younger than even Volmunst. And he only had two Virtues, the same as some Rothars and Devinars!
A knock came at the door and Okin bid the knocker to enter.
Gendro craned his neck through and gave a cheeky smile. He was holding a plate of food, and the smell made Okin's stomach grumble loudly.
"My apologies," Okin said. "It seems I let my hunger get the better of me."
Gendro smiled, "No apologies required Impalias. It's my job to do things like bring you food after all. Would you like to eat here or in the conservatory? I could also bring the plate back to the dining room if you would like."
"Which did Impalias Aldwin prefer?" Okin asked.
"He enjoyed his lunches in the conservatory. One of the many reasons he had this room converted from a sitting room to a study."
Okin waved Gendro towards the conservatory. "Outside it is, then."
Gendro held the glass door to the conservatory open for Okin. He drank in the sunlight as he sat down at the room's small table. The sunlight gave the room a pleasant, but not stuffy, warmth.
The Rothar set the plate plate of food down. It was a dish of spiced beef on a plate of roasted vegetables, with a dark red sauce that drenched the plate. "Aldwin picked a great cook, didn't he?"
"He did, Impalias. It is the way I show my Joy and Creativity the world," Gendro smiled.
Okin eagerly dug into the food, shoveling bites into his mouth. He was five bites in before he realized how Gluttonous his behaviour appeared. He set his fork down and wiped the sauce away from the corner of his chin with a mirthful smile.
"I guess Aldwin was more dignified, wasn't he?" Okin asked Gendro.
Gendro leaned against one of the glass walls, watching two birds hopping around each other in the garden outside. "Not at all, Impalias. I don't think I've ever seen a man eat faster than Impalias Aldwin did."
"Truly?"
Gendro nodded. "If he ate at all, that is. I remember when I first began, Amesa would often have to force Aldwin to make time for meals."
Okin could understand why. He had spent the better part of the night reading papers by candle light, but the stack of reports on his desk had only grown and grown. Most of the reports were meaningless numbers to Okin. A confirmation of shipments at a dock, reports on the elevation of this Othar or that Athar, a Krusadars' distinguished actions, a string of murders in one of the northern regions. He knew each of the reports meant everything to someone, but they meant nothing to him.
Okin wanted desperately to slow down and learn each and every person's story. He wanted to know the Othar's and Athar's under him, their wishes, their struggles, their families, and understand how exactly every resource of Whenran was used. But he didn't have time.
"Perhaps it's best if you do the same and remind me when to eat." Okin said as he forked another piece of vegetable.
"I already did, Impalias," a small smile tugged at the edges of Gendro's mouth.
Okin ate the next few bites in silence. He watched the two birds in the garden alongside Gendro, wondering what problems troubled their worlds.
Far off, Okin could hear rapid knocking at the main door. The two clergymen turned at the sound.
"Were we expecting anyone?" Okin asked.
"No, we were not," Gendro motioned for Okin to stay seated as he moved off towards the main hall. A moment later voices came from the hall; it was a voice Okin recognized.
"Previa?" Okin asked, standing. He made his way back to the study as his friend burst through the door, out of breath.
"He's here!" Previa's eyes popped wide with veins, and he looked almost manic.
"Who's here?" Okin looked to Gendro, but the aide was equally confused.
"The man, the one from the East that we've been hearing about. He's here, and he's claiming to be Aredal!"
Okin froze. If he had been holding his dinner plate, it would have shattered across the floor. He had heard the rumours, but they were just that. /Rumours/. Made by some trumped-up warlord in the East trying to spread their heretical religion.
"Y-you need to see him," Previa gasped. "I ran all the way here from the outer gates."
"He's attacking the Citadel?" Okin asked.
"No, he's in the walls," Previa replied.
"He's already breached the wall?"
"He comes in peace!" Previa yelled. "He wants to recruit us? He wants us to join him for something, I couldn't make it all out."
"Thank you for coming to get me," Okin said. He pushed past Previa before turning back. "Gendro, get a carriage and guards ready, and Previa something to drink."
Gendro nodded leaving the study at a run. "Sit, sit, catch your breath."
Previa waved Okin off, "My dad. Where is he?"
"They didn't tell you?" Okin blinked, dumbfounded.
"Just tell me where he is."
"He's in a hospital near here. Two rings in, and four streets clockwise."
"Thank you," Previa grabbed Okin into a tight, sweaty, hug.
The younger man ran off faster than Okin had ever seen him move. It reminded him of what had just happened at the front. Had he made a mistake? He couldn't think about what that boy was up to. He probably was just excited to see his father.
Okin clasped his cape on as he ran to the street. He was surprised to find Gendro ready with the carriage. The aide sat in the driver's position, one armoured Devinar beside him, and another in the carriage. Okin leaped in and yelled at Gendro to drive.
Gendro spurred the horses down Nexon boulevard. It seemed most people in the inner wall had yet to hear of the figures' arrival; along the avenue people milled about their daily tasks, unaware of the gravity of the moment. Okin felt like a fool-- there's no way Previa would be pulling a prank about something like this on Okin's first week as Impalias, would he?
The carriage passed through the gates of the inner wall at a worrying speed. It soon became clear that Previa was in fact not lying. Gendro shouted at pedestrians as they barrelled past shops and homes. Halfway through the outer ring, they began to run into a thicket of bystanders. From inside the carriage Okin could hear their shouts of amazements, but couldn't make out the exact event or words.
"What can you see?" Okin asked Gendro, leaning out the carriage window.
"I can't see anything."
"Get out, we're walking," Okin hopped out of the carriage. The two Devinars fell in behind him, allowing Gendro to take point.
"Impalias coming!" Gendro's voice bellowed over the crowd. The outer ranks turned to see him and parted. A whisper passed like a wave through the crowd at the sight of Okin.
"Impalias, it's truly him!" A man in the crowd shouted in esctacy. "Aredal, reborn!"
Enthusiastic nods followed through the crowd.
"He did it!" Another voice came. "Aredal's power, he has it!"
Okin wheeled on the voice, practically grabbing the man. "What did he do, what did he do exactly?"
"He made us all /powerful/," the man seemed to be vibrating with energy. His eyes had a faint glowing sheen behind the iris. The man claiming to be Aredal had obviously done something to the crowd, showed them something. Okin just needed a reliable source.
Okin pushed past Gendro, despite the Rothar's protest, and into the crowd.
As he neared the front the voice of the man claiming to be Aredal trickled in his ears.
"If you all join the pyramid, all our problems would be easily overcome. We believe this to be the optimal course for us all."
Okin pushed past the final ranks of the crowd and found himself face to face with /his/ God. The man had the correct look of Aredal. He looked slightly older than Aredal did in the paintings. But he had the correct silver eyes and hair. Okin wasn't sure if he felt more comfortable that he had seen this man as a giant statue in the center of the Citadel so many times. He froze like a frog as the man stared down at him with an expectant look.

:END:
"Are you the one claiming to be Aredal?" The word left Okin's mouth in a frantic rush.
"We are," the man's voice had a calming, authoritative air.
"Why have you returned now, of all times," Okin asked.
"Yeah! Is Tregale coming back?" a voice from the crowd yelled. The rest of the crowd drew silent at the name.
"Tregale..." the man paused. "Tregale will one day return, and we will be there to fight alongside you all."
"But how?" Okin asked. If the man was truly Aredal reborn, he would know the Truth. The Truth of it all.
"He will return by his own will," the man said. "If you join me in my pyramid, we can prepare the world for Tregale's arrival."
The crowd seemed to accept that answer.
"Do you really hate Tregale?" Okin asked.
"We do. He is an evil that must be wiped out." The end of the reply tightened Okin's body. The Onorun said that Aredal was the most Compassionate man. That he hated no one, not even his greatest enemies. He understood his role in protecting, but took no great pleasure in combat.
A cheer went up from the crowd, and Okin felt his stomach drop at the response. The man looked the part, and maybe he had done some special Heraldry, but he had none of the Truth about him. The Impalias fell silent, allowing the questions of the crowd to drown him out. The shells of some questions drifted around his mind, but they were overshadowed by a monstrous, depressing weight.
"When will the others return?" he heard a faint echo in his ear, though the question had come from so close to him.
"Soon. Soon," the imposter said, sounding days away now.
A woman burst through the crowd, "Show it again, please. Show us your power."
Okin turned this time to see. The man smiled at the woman, and touched two fingers to her forehead. She began to glow, until she was a brilliant light in the crowd. She laughed and began to grow. Her laughter shifted to calm and she began to grow back to her normal size. It was as if the imposter had blessed the woman with the gifts of a Light Herald.
"We are Aredal reborn." The man said, his voice booming with Light Herald amplification.
From behind, a new commotion moved the crowd. Okin turned to see Impalias Henard and Impalias Ovolo parting the crowd.
"We are glad to more Impaliases have come to observe our majesty," the imposter said.
"I am Impalias Ovolo, and this is Impalias Henard." Ovolo stood two paces in front of Henard, his hand resting on his sword.
"Your reputations proceed you."
"You claim to be Aredal?" Henard asked, his eyes bounced up and down the imposter's face and body.
The imposter shook his head, "we make no claims. We simply are Aredal."
Ovolo raised a scarred eyebrow. "Why should we believe you?"
"Because your people do," he gestured to the crowd who gave a deafening cheer. "We only ask for your support in our quest to unify Central Marthia under our banner. The world will eventually be united, as your Onorun speaks."
A guard, dressed in a stark white uniform, motioned for the imposter's attention.
"Unfortunately, we do not have much time. The people in Central Marthia require my attention."
As the man turned away, a new shout rose on the wind. Okin recognized the desperate voice as Previa's instantly. He was more than a hundred paces away, trailing a cart with two Istar nurses in it, sprinting as fast as the horses that pulled it.
"Aredal! AREDAL!"
The imposter hadn't heard Previa. The guard opened a portal as Previa continued to barrel towards the Imposter. The portal grew, and Previa's cart seemed to grow further and further with each and every second.
A final cheer went up in the crowd as the imposter stepped through the portal. A moment later the portal collapsed. The sound of thundering hooves came to a halt as Previa drew up at the edge of the crowd. The Devinar hopped off the cart to run through the crowd at Okin.
"Where did he go? My dad, he needs to heal my dad!" Previa grabbed Okin by the shoulder, shaking his older friend.
"I- I think he left," Okin was in shock from the whole ordeal. The crowd erupted in cheering and chatter as Previa clasped his face in panic, but Okin's world shrunk to the little void in his mind.
Previa shook Okin once more, "what do you mean he left!? He just got here!"
The younger man's hair fell in front of his face, his eyes losing focus. Okin could feel Previa's finger digging into his shoulders till the pain surged through his upper body.
"How could he abandon us?" Faces in crowd turned towards Previa's ranting. "He's Aredal, isn't he? Aredal wouldn't abandon us, he wouldn't!"
A bronze skinned hand grabbed Previa by the shoulders, yanking the man off Okin. "Pull yourself together, young man. You are better than this. Do not shame your father."
Ovolo had one hand on Previa's shoulder-- it was he that trying to shake the sense back into the man.
"My dad needs to be healed! He won't sur-" a slap cracked the air as Ovolo back-handed Previa.
"What would your father say seeing you like this? Ranting and raving like a mad heretic."
"Impalias Ovolo, there's no need for this...," Henard placed a hand on Okin's shoulder to silence the younger Impalias.
Previa's face fell slowly, "dad would be ashamed... you're right Impalias."
Ovolo let Previa go with a slight scoff. Okin was shocked by the Impalias' attitude, he had seemed a calm mediator in the meeting-- no hint of the domineering attitude Ovolo had just shown could be seen.
Ovolo turned to the crowd and shouted over the bodies, "all of you, disperse yourselves."
Before the crowd could react, the Grand Marshal turned to the two other Impaliases. "I will go inform the Mouth of these events. You two handle the crowd."
Ovolo whistled his horse over and flung himself into the saddle in one fluid motion, the same process would've taken Okin minutes, not seconds.
"What-- what do we do now?" Okin slowly turned to Henard. The older man gave a slight shrug. Okin was surprised at how unphased the two Impaliases seemed, though he could see Henard's eyes darting around in thought. This was ultimate, unreal-- a moment that marked the beginning of the end of the prophecies in the Onorun. A moment that no one imagined their lifetimes would take place during.
"The people will leave soon enough, Ovolo worries too much about them," Henard said.
"I mean, about the impostor!" Okin shouted. The words exploded from his lips, and by the time they left he tried to shut them. By Henard's look, he could tell he sounded almost as unhinged as Previa.
Henard raised a gray eyebrow, "why are you so quick to label him an imposter?"
"He's obviously not Aredal. He knew nothing about Tregale, and his attitude is all wrong."
"There is no Truth in that," Henard said. "How do we know whether he is or is not Aredal? Those who believe will see the signs. Skeptics like you will point only to inconsistencies and say all evidence is coincidence. To truly embody Truth, you must leave your mind open to all possibilities."
Okin saw the Wisdom in that reasoning. Okin had called the man an imposter based on a reaction, on one sentence and his knowledge of the Onorun. But there was doubtless countless arguments and passages in the Onorun that would justify this man as Aredal reborn.
"I'm sure this will be quiet the topic in the next meeting." Henard said with a smile.
* Chapter VI
** Chapter
It had been twelve days, three whole weeks since the man claiming to be Aredal had arrived at the Citadel. Okin had set a member of his staff to collect all the information they had on the imposter. They hadn't been able to turn up any new information, only growing rumours. People said he was a man controlled by Deionis to trick them all. Others said they had seen him give the man the ability to fly, or that he had healed the dying. None of those were the Truth. Okin still felt it was useful to keep track of and make note of.
Even without the rumours, Okin could feel the difference in energy as he walked towards the central Cathedral. Okin had spent the previous two weeks in Whenran, overseeing certain matters in person. He had returned the previous day via the Citadel's own portal network. Okin had never been able to afford to use the Guild's network of portals, nor had he been granted access to the Citadel's portal network as an Athar. Being able to get anywhere in the Versalist would in a matter of hours was a level of privilege that was hard to comprehend.
The Cathedral was overflowing with worshippers as Okin and Gendro approached. They had come down Nexon Boulevard, passing devotes leaving and making their way towards the Cathedral. In front of statue of Nexon, people had gathered in group prayer, the smell and haze of burning incense filling the street.
Aredal's entrance was even more extreme. People lined the boulevard, shoulder to shoulder, all the way past the statue. If Okin had been just an Athar there was no hope he would have been able to make it to the crowd. Even with his robes on and Gendro's bellowing voice, it took nearly half an hour to get from the statue of Aredal to the Cathedral's door.
Inside the Cathedral, people packed the pews in every one of the four quadrants. The constant song of prayer rose in one harmonious voice from the crowd that shook Okin's very soul. He had only ever seen a mass as large as this outside of the army's pre-battle prayer; those prayers contained thousand about thousands of ranks of Devinars and Krusadars but paled in comparison to the devotary before Okin. As Okin ascended the stairs to the meeting room, the prayers could still be heard in muted tones.
Okin was the first to arrive in the meeting room, alone he finally had the opportunity to explore the details of the room. Portraits of all the sixteen hung around the room. The portraits were evidently aged by their slightly faded colours and faint cracking. It seemed nothing, even in the heart of Versalism, was eternal.
The portrait of Aredal looked nearly exactly like the man who had claimed to be Aredal reborn. The same silver eyes and hair, the same hawkish nose and pointed chin. Upon closer investigation, it was clear the portrait had even included the folds around the man's small thin eyes. It was remarkable how closely the man's appearance mirrored the one in the portrait. As he stared at the portrait, Okin could easily understand how one could believe the man had in fact been Aredal.
"The resemblance is truly uncanny," Okin turned to see Henard enter the chamber. "These are the oldest paintings of the gods we have. They date back to only a hundred years after the Ascension."
The fact caused Okin to take a step back. He had thought these paintings to be a hundred, maybe two hundred years old. To know they were nearly nine hundred shocked Okin. They hadn't been preserved poorly, rather it was incredible they had been preserved so well.
"Do you believe these portraits to have Truth in them?" Okin asked.
Henard nodded in response.
"Then should we not believe the man is speaking to Truth with his claims?" Okin asked.
"It is a component," Henard said after a long moment. "But we must consider every component to arrive at Truth. Come, take a seat, the others should arrive soon."
Okin took the same seat as he had in the previous meeting, Henard sat three chairs down from him. As the first Impaliases arrived, Okin sat alone till Volmunst arrived.
"Impalias Okin," the hulk of a man said as he took the seat next to Okin. Okin gave a small nod in reply.
"I want you to know that I appreciate your support in the last meeting. I find it harder and harder to find sympathy for my people amongst this /council/."
"Of course, Impalias," Okin said.
"I liked your predecessor quite a bit. Very fair man." Volmunst gave a long, sad sigh with his words.
"He's technically not my predecessor. I'm only here temporarily." Okin said.
The older Impalias shook his head, "you're a shoe in to be the next Impalias now. As long as you don't completely ruin everything, which you seem smart enough to not do."
Volmunst flashed a quick chuckle and patted Okin on the back.
"Be nice, Volmunst," bald-headed Mikeol said as he swept into the room. "Our role is no easy task."
"I was being nice. Simply complimenting the young Impalias on how well he's performed. Don't you think?"
"We have seen worse," Mikeol sat down in the other chair at Okin's side as the final Impaliases filed in. The small din of conversation fell to silence as the tenth and final Impaliases sat, a man who hadn't been present at the prior meeting. Impalias Xohl'a of Neiexilee'i, the black sheep of the Versalist territories. Like the colonies that had recently been founded in the ruins of Vianarya, Neiexilee'i existed overseas in Caspo, but had full territory status. It was self-sufficient, and one of the more materially rich territories in the Versalist world, and didn't require support from the Wreathwardian territories like the colonial lands did.
Xohl'a was a tall wisp of a man, the Impalias robes fell off the his thin frame to swallow him in a swath of cloth. The man had dark obsidian skin, far darker than any of the Wreathwardian Impaliases, which stood out against the the golden jewlery he wore. Two large golden bands hung around his neck, and small golden hoop earrings threaded the lobe and cartilage of his left ear.
No one spoke as the group waited for the Mouth to descend from his room above the meeting chamber. The Mouth had not been seen or heard from since the man from Bei-San had come. When the Mouth finally descended into the chamber, all ten sets of eyes turned to watch him.
He looked like he had aged ten years in the last three weeks. The already old man now hunched as he walked, new wrinkles had set in across his forehead, and his walk was now shaky and hobbled. Volmunst and Ovolo rose from their seat offering to help the Mouth to his seat. The Mouth waved them off and went to collapse into his elevated chair.
"For the past weeks, I have prayed, fasted, and given all I can to the Gods in hope that they shine their Wisdom upon me. All so I may know if this man from the East is one spoken of in the Onorun. But this is not a question I can answer on my own. I am putting the topic of the man from the East onto the Registir and forcing its selection as the first topic for today's meeting. I'm sure everyone will agree."
Of course that would be the topic, Okin didn't need to see it on the Registir to know it was the only thing that would be discussed on this momentous day. Okin glanced to his side to see Mikeol sat up from his casual lounge. The bald laced his fingers together, leaning forward.
"No comments? For such a chatty bunch, I had thought you'd all have your opinions." A small smile tugged the Mouth's lips. "Mathelin? You're always so vocal."
The shorter man visibly tensed as attention in the room passed to him.
"If you must know my thoughts, I believe it's too soon to say. None of us witnessed his arrival did we?" Heads around the table shook. "I did not even witness the man with my own eyes. Only three of us did."
"That is a good point," Henard said. "It is in both Truth and Wisdom to make such impactful decisions based on solid and ample evidence."
Evidently, news of how the events had transpired had spread as Okin felt more than half the Impaliases glance over to his direction.
"I did see him," Ovolo's deep voice carried as if yelled in the anticipatory silence of the room. "I believe this man to be Aredal returned."
Ovolo cut through the gasps from around the table barreling forward, "the Onorun says he will appear in response to a great evil, in a time of great need for the Citadel. We've been fighting a war with the Western heretics for nearly four-hundred years now, but somehow despite our greater masses and stronger military they hold their ground. Perhaps the Darkness has conjured some threat in Surkusch that we've yet to see unleashed upon the Citadel."
"If that were the case would he have not appeared during the Crisis of 670?" Henard asked.
Ricartotten shook his head, his two braided cords of hair shifting, "Aredal knew that joining the strength of Ottencollen to the Citadel would be enough to weather the crisis. The coming storm is greater than even the crisis which forged the Citadel as we know it now."
Mathelin rolled his eyes, and though Okin didn't think such childish expression was necessary, he did agree that neither was Ricartotten's boastfulness about his own territory, in the high council of all places.
"Evidence? Do we have it? For this, coming storm?" Xhol'a spoke in a clipped Trentanian accent.
Henard shook his head, "I believe there is folly in this line of thought. This man from the east could be the coming storm himself."
"/There will be deceivers/," Okin quoted the Onorun.
Henard nodded his square head. "The Onorun is the highest Truth which we must all uphold. It speaks clearly of deceivers, and cautions Wisdom in the face of men who declare the Return."
"But we must also be Curious and explore all possibilities." The jowls of fat on Vovwaq's chin vibrated as he spoke. "This man has power we haven't seen since the Gods ascended."
"All foreign propaganda," Mathelin dismissed the possibility with a wave of his hand. "What has this man done? Some tricks in front of some commoners? Yet he asks us to join him in a war to conquer the East? He asks us to overextend ourselves, give him what technology we know, and bow to his foreign religion, and we are supposed to believe he is Aredal reborn?"
Okin had found his request for the Versalist World to join him in the heretical /Vareeshi/ religion strange. Bei-San had not been a Vareeshi country until their Synodontis, this man returned, had declared them one-- their prior worship of a figure who seemed to possibly be Aredal was still a lacking heresy, but obviously closer to the Truth than the chaotic and violent Vareeshi. Still, the pragmatist in Okin could see the ways in which they could be exploited to swiftly unify the heretical lands to the East.
"If we had increased our missionary efforts, perhaps he would not have been forced to adopt the local religion to unite the East." Ricartotten had long been an advocate of the idea that Wreathward needed to aggressively send Athars and Othars into Marthia to convert the populous. It was a project his precursor in Ottencollen had begun to great effect.
"The Onorun does say that he will return in the East, and in Bei-San. We all heard the reports when he initially appeared, and we all knew they matched the descriptions of Aredal's return in the Onorun. Perhaps it was a neglection of Truth that we did not pursue this matter further before." Okin leaned forward at Levinor's words. The man seldom spoke, but it was the contents of his words that drew Okin in. Okin had not even believed the man existed, let alone heard the stories of how he had appeared.
:comment:
Figure out how Aredal returened. Also work out the rest of the signs of his return
:END:
"Not all the signs have yet to pass. However, I see enough signs of the Onorun's Truth that I believe we are witnessing the Return."
"What of the other Four? That is one of my biggest concerns." Okin asked. "The Onorun tells that all Four will Return as one."
"As one, but not at once," Levinor replied. "The others may be amongst us already. The Onorun does not say when they will reveal themselves, they may be waiting to surprise the Darkness."
"Rubbish!" Mathelin sputtered. "It is just reading whatever you want the Onorun to say that "as one" means they would arrive far apart from each other! And the Four aren't a den of theives who need to sneak up behind the Darkness, like some Dark Herald themselves! They would proudly claim their right as the Gods of the Citadel!"
Levinor's thin, wrinkly finger clasped his chin. "That is a fair point, Impalias Mathelin. Still, /it is folly to say that any man alone can read the minds of the Gods, even reading the words from their lips/."
"It applies to every man," Mathelin gesticulated forward.
"We are losing the war with Surkusch," Volmunst finally said. "As much as I disagree with Mathelin's approach to the problem, the Kaihani and other Hierhersans are growing in power. We could well be on our way to a second Crisis of 670. It's very possible we are living in the Return."
"It is impossible for us to know whether we are witnessing the Return until it has passed. There are so many signs of the Return that have yet to come to vote now would be folly."
"And that is not even the issue," Mikeol said. "This man does not only ask us to acknowledge him as Aredal. But swear our troops to his holy crusade?"
Okin understood Mikeol, but failed to see the distinction. If the man was truly Aredal, then they should happily swear their troops to his crusade, even under the guise of Vareeshi.
"I would sooner believe this man is Deionis attempting to lure us into self sabotage, than Aredal truly returned. How many of you believe this Imposter?" Mikeol looked around the room then to the Mouth.
"Perhaps it is good to find the temperature of this issue. Please, if you would now, confirm this man as Aredal raise your hand."
Okin was shocked by how many Impliases raised their hands. Vovwaq seemed to be convinced by the signs that existed and taken up by the excitement brewing in the Citadel. Ricartotten obviously saw this as an excuse to throw more into the Marthian front and his missionary projects, and Okin was scared by the Impalias' lack of care for the sacredness of the matter. Xohl'a was unreadable, Okin knew so little of the man's home land and the needs of this far off territory. Levinor also raised his hand, but with a caveat that he would vote no if everyone else voted yes as he only thought it was more likely than not but they needed to discuss it more.
Ovolo and Volmunst both surprised Okin. It seemed they both truly believed the war was going so poorly that Aredal would return to put them back on the path to victory.
That left only Okin, Mikeol, Mathelin and Henard in the way of the Imposter from Bei-San taking power and being declared as a God that marked the end of times.
* Chapter VII
Okin's eyes popped open. The world was blurry, and felt upside down... hazy Light shone in from below. His arm was limp but also in pain, dragging him down to the center of Opartha, wherever that was...
"YEECH!" He felt a little stab at his eyelid-- and another at his chin. He jerked up, and nearly slid off table. Wiping his eyes, he saw the stack of papers he had cut himself on, and a ball of spittle mixed with the ink on the lone sheet below. His curtains were still open, letting a little bit of grayish light into the soft yellowish room.
He jiggled his head and bounced his shoulders until the blood flowed normally and his arms came back to life.
/Knock knock./ He turned to the door. /Knock knock./ That must've been what woke him up.
"Come in!" Okin shouted, his legs still to limp to move.
There was a /chk-- chk/ behind the door. Okin sighed and got up to get it.
He swung open the door and met Previa's bright smile.
"Devinar Previa," Okin's voice was still groggy. "Were you not greeted by Athar Gendro?"
"He told me you had a late night and I could get you myself. This was after I came here three times and he'd said you were busy. No matter which of the Four you are, the requirements for Athar should be to have a little more balls," Previa chuckled.
Okin groaned and his thick eyebrows narrowed at the young Devinar. "Previa, I'm an Impalias now. What are you here for?"
"I apologize, Impalias Okin," he spoke in a voice like a young teen pretending to speak like his father and saluted. "I won't busy your schedule with such non-urgent matters."
"Previa, if you came all this way, stop wasting both of our time and get to it," Okin said and rubbed his forehead.
"I just came to check on you. I know that all these guys are just running around with their agendas," Previa wrapped an arm around Okin's back. "It's just like when you went off to Oleda to study: there's none of the Dockmasters looking out for ya!"
Previa slapped Okin on the back. "'Cept me now!"
Okin squirmed away from Previa and sighed, but the boy inside him had to resist cracking a smile at the 'Dockmasters'. It was the place where all the rowdiness of the teenage boys of the south side of Metheno gathered-- Okin had been the 'mature' 'overseer' who both Tempered the gang, but also let them run wild. But the smile faded as his mind shuffled through the faces-- Previa, Donnin, Losoh, Paal-- /Cynin/.
Okin had forgotten about the man; over these several weeks, he hadn't even really been able to think about him-- it was crazy to think that his old friend returning and nearly /assassinating/ his former mentor had only been the /second/ craziest thing that had happened in the past two months-- scrunched between a possible /Aredal/ returning and Okin becoming an Impalias. Previa and Cynin were closer in age, and were close friends before.
Inside, Okin gasped. He stared at Previa's excitable, sharp eyes-- he hadn't even told the young Devinar that it was Cynin and Damin this whole time.
Previa didn't read Okin's concern-- he had already begun talking.
"So. What do you Impaliases think about-- you know, /him/?"
Okin cleared his throat. Even Previa was thinking more about the Aredal-or-not then what had happened to his father. "Our meetings are of the highest confidentiality. You know that, Previa."
"Oh come on, Okin! This is the biggest event since-- since the Ascension and Creation of the Citadel, for crying out loud! How is it in Truth that we don't know what the Mouth speaks on this issue?"
"That's Imp--"
"Sorry, /Impalias/ Okin," Previa rolled his eyes.
Okin sat down on the bed. His backside had been sore from all the paperwork and meetings. Even his short stint as a purely behind-the-desk logistics Rothar in Whenran didn't compare to how much time in the chair this was-- sheer amount of reading and writing had to be more than triple, even with his whole team of assistants.
Previa plopped down next to him, jiggling the entire wool mattress.
"I will say that there are differing opinions, as you could have surmised, and I have been surprised that so many are so ready to accept that this is without a doubt, Aredal, so immeadiately. But unless you'd like to engage with me in a theological debate-- which I don't have the time for, and I doubt you have the patience for-- there is not much more to say."
Previa nodded emphatically and threw his hands up. "I know! There's no way something isn't going on. Where are the others of the Four? Why would he have us be Vareeshi, of all things? Isn't there supposed to be an attack from the Five before the Return?"
Okin just stared at Previa. Even though he actually agreed with all the points, he knew that Previa didn't come up with them himself, he was just repeating talking points he heard. He hoped the Devinar at least understood what he was saying.
"I know that the attempt on dad's life was part of this, too. Whoever's behind this just knew that dad wouldn't be pushed around and would stand for the Truth!"
Previa turned and smiled to Okin.
"Thankfully, they didn't know that dad would be smart enough to recommend 'honest Okin' in his place. You're going shout to every citizen of the Citadel he's a Deception of Tregale and Deionis, I know it!"
Okin shook his head. "I agree with you Devinar Previa, this does not seem to be in Truth. But my duty is as an Impalias now and I will just do that, my duty."
"Yes, and isn't your duty to /strike down/ anyone who dares imitate our God?" Previa's knuckles grew white in a clenched fist.
"But would the Aredal-- the Aredal WE WORSHIP-- really be callous enough to just show up to all his believers, and then leave them without healing one of their leaders in need?" Previa asked.
"I don't think he saw you, Previa," Okin said.
"He's supposed to be /Aredal/. Perfect. He wouldn't make a mistake like that! The Onorun says /My Compassion will touch everyone who calls/!
"Aredal 2 4:14. But it's actually /My Compassion will hear all those who hear me/."
"Oh. Right."
Okin chastised himself for being so Pessimistic, but part of him knew Previa didn't know these verses before-- he had only started putting his nose to the Onorun after the man from Bei-San had arrived in the Citadel. But still, Previa's point stood-- surely Aldwin and Previa were those who heard Aredal, right? There were a lot of debates about the nature of the Gods' perfection, that had moved from spiritual retreats for Athars and theological debates for retired Othars to conversations on the market street, to the dinner table, and to of course, the high table of the Impaliases. Even the minor Gods were seen as holy and perfect, but the Four were seen as /more/ perfect, but does that mean that in every way they could make no mistakes? If that was true, how did they let Tregale and Deionis bring in the Darkness and the other Devils? But of course, it wasn't their fault. But still, that had to be a mistake of some kind, right? The text said that though the Gods have prophesized and created their own destiny, and by that the destiny of all of Opartha, even they could not stop all the Darkness alone, which is why Versalism was required. If they had Returned, would they be perfect enough to /literally/ hear the needs of every person, or was that just not even possible as an incarnate being, regardless of perfection?
Previa stood to his feet. He paced around the room.
"We know that wasn't Aredal, but with how much support this has been getting, and you saying even the Impaliases seem on board, I know this is just all one big thing, and it all ties into what happened to my dad. Whoever the assassins were that day, I'm gonna find them, and I'm gonna unveil this whole conspiracy!" Previa's voice shook the papers off Okin's table. His throat popped with a vein; his shouts like the day the man from Bei-San had arrived.
"Oh. Sorry, O-- Impalias Okin," Previa lowered his arms.
This was a smooth opportunity for Okin to tell Previa about Cynin-- one he needed to take, even though it made his skin crawl. /Aredal 1 8:2: Truth is not just telling no lies when asked-- it is a duty to use one's voice to spread it as far as possible./
"Uhm, Previa," Okin stood and put his hand on his friends' shoulder. Previa turned-- his eyes shook with pain. Okin felt a pang in his heart-- perhaps he had been too distracted by the recent chaos and his new responsiblity too perform his real duty of comforting his friend in such a time.
"We'll make sure whoever hurt your dad will be brought to justice," Okin said. "But I think it's important you know who I think it is. I should have told you sooner."
Previa focused on Okin. Even though they were alone, Okin lowered his voice to a whisper.
"I think it was Cynin," Okin said.
Previa's eyes widened. "That's not-- he'd be dead, Okin."
"But, it would make sense, them coming to kill Aldwin. And he--," Okin said.
"How would you even know it was them?"
Okin flinched at the slight venom in his friend's words, "I-- like I said, I don't. But it just, it looked enough like Cynin. I didn't see the other one, but it was probably Damin. Only one came off the stage, and hsi face looked like Cynin."
"I mean, how far away were you?" Previa asked.
"I don't know. Twenty paces, or something."
"You could've mistaken, especially if you only saw one," Previa said. "It's been ten years. Cynin had hardly started puberty when you last saw him. I don't think it was him. I just /know/ this has to do with what's happening now. But whoever it was, I won't stop until they're brought to Justice."
Okin nodded.
"I want to lead the task force that's searching for my dad's attackers."
Okin looked down and clasped his hands together. It would obviously be nepotism-- which could become Corruption-- but perhaps Previa did have the passion to maximize the chances of the offenders being found.
"Okay," Okin said. "I'll notify the task force tomorrow, but I can't promise that they'll let you be leader. Krusadar Vintro is already assigned, and it would be an insult to the chain of command."
"At least get me on their trail," Previa said.
Okin bit his lip. "I will."
"Great, great," Previa paced around the room again. "I haven't been lying down on the other front, either. The Four have seen that I'm fighting against Corruption and Deception and led me to a group right here in the Citadel. They've seen through the lies of this Deceiver and are fighting them! We're called the True Light, and I at a street rally yesterday and told the others I'd invite you for the next one in two days-- we're having one every Aredal. An Impalias on our side is exactly what we need!"
Okin frowned. Though he was still steadfast in believing that this man was not Aredal, and therefore, had to be a Deceiver, fracturing factions in the Citadel was bad news, unprecedented bad news. Perhaps this was truly the sign of the Return.
"I can't do that, Previa," Okin said. "And the last thing the Citadel needs now is more division."
"/Do not be afraid to stand with the Truth, even if you alone stand with it, then I am standing with you. Aredal 3 9:17/," Previa quoted.
Okin raised an eyebrow and smiled. "Impressive, Previa. If this so-called 'True Light' is getting you to memorize your verses, then perhaps I am not against their influence."
"So you'll come then?" Previa's eyes lit up. Even though he thought Previa was coming from a Foolish place, it was also his responsiblity to be informed about the people of the Citadel, and to support his friend.
"I will."


Okin strut down the austere, cramped white quartz halls. His eyes drifted over a gold-framed sign that read "Whenran - Heddsen" and another that read "Monasque - Maritou" that led to another hall, but his body moved steady; he knew where he was going.
"Impalias Okin," a thin man with a sharp goatee nodded as Okin turned into a corridor. The man stood at the end of the corridor, and though his neck turned to Okin his arms were stretched out. Wispy, glowing, swirling violet lines flowed from his fingertips into a an oval filled with the substance a bit taller than a man, gradually increasing in size as Okin approached.
Okin gave a respectful nod. He stepped /through/ the oval-- the portal-- the violet swirling substance filled his peripherals.
The purple all around him snapped to a living room with warmth on all sides, rug, wool curtains, mahogany fireplace. He had been transported to the Impalias head office at Heddsen, where he had been working for the past few weeks. He stepped forward and nodded to a short man behind him, who was maintaining the same portal like the man with the goatee.
Okin stopped in his tracks as he heard a /sippp/ over the crackling of the fireplace. A large, round back covered with fancy robes, the same as Okin's, faced him.
"Impalias Vovwaq?" Okin raised en eyebrow.
"Oh!" the massive form turned around, squeaking the wooden chair as he did so. "There you are. I apologize, Okin, I meant no intrusion. I thought it would be worse to bug you at your home in the Citadel," Vovwaq smiled and held up a large bottle. "I brought some premium Monasquen wine-- aged since 889! Can you believe that this bottle is older than the two of us put together?"
The fat Impalias chuckled.
"Here, why don't we go to your office," Vovwaq stood up and motioned with his arm. Though Okin felt rather ambushed by the Impalias, Vovwaq had a way of welcoming himself in and being hard to deny. Okin just nodded and walked towards his office, Vovwaq in tow.
The office had a similar style to the hearth. Artifacts and bookshelves lined the walls, but set up in a neat, warm way-- only browns and dark reds were chosen for the bindings, and a sword hung on the wall was softened by the oval wood display backing. The chocolate desk was placed in the center of the room, with just enough space on each side to get around.
Vovwaq placed the wine bottle and glasses on the table and went immeadiately for the guest chair leant against the side of the wall, and put it in the space between the desk and the bookshelf, so he was partially behind the desk like Okin. Okin was about to ask why he was here, when he started pouring the wine into two cups with a big-lipped smile.
Okin cringed as Vovwaq filled the bottle. "That's enough."
Vovwaq continued for a moment longer after Okin said it. The glass was near full-- far too much for Okin's Temperance. But such expensive wine felt like it could not be wasted-- perhaps he could have the glass over the entire day.
"So first I wanted to congratulate you on being a successful new Impalias," Vovwaq said and raised his glass. Okin cinked his glass against Vovwaq's.
"Thank you, Impalias Vovwaq."
"All you've gone through-- and stepping up as the youngest Impalias-- /yeesh/, maybe in the history of the /Citadel/-- you surely deserve Bravery."
Okin's lips stopped just on the rim of the wineglass. "We've known each other for less than two months, Vovwaq. I don't think that's enough time to know a Virtue, and I have done nothing special to consider for Bravery."
"No, no," Vovwaq flicked his wrist. "You're an equal among us, and we've already come to respect you-- you're definitely already more popular than Mathelin. It's just I think you're deserving of looking a little more like an equal."
Okin's eyes narrowed. "What are you trying to say exactly?"
"Well, I think you deserve Bravery," before Okin could protest, Vovwaq raised a finger. "However, it would be amazing if you could receive your Virtue just as Aredal is returning to the Citadel after being recognized."
"Well, if you're referring to the man from Bei-San, I don't believe he's Aredal, as I made clear last vote," Okin scoweled.
Vovwaq swallowed. "Oh, well I know you'll /change your mind/. And I think that is quite a Brave thing to do, to change one's mind and to be so young but still a leader bringing forth a new era; I could personally see that as worthy of Bravery."
Okin set down his glass and raised two hands between him and Vovwaq. "A-are you trying to bribe me, Impalias Vovwaq?"
Vovwaq's jaw dropped, and he shook his head. "No, no! No such thing!"
"You're saying that if I change my vote-- if I act against what I understand as Truth-- you'll mark my Bravery. That is a bribe," Okin stood to his feet. "Leave."
Vovwaq shifted in his chair. "Well, if that's the way you see it, so be it. If you change your mind any time--"
"I asked you to leave my office," Okin pointed at the door.
Vovwaq stood up. He set down his glass-- now empty. The chubby, gregarious Impalias' face closed from inviting to fearsome.
"You are making a mistake, Impalias Okin."
Okin matched the Impaliases' stare and just kept his finger pointed at the door. Vovwaq brushed off his robes before leaving without a word.
Vovwaq slammed the door, and the desk shook. Okin's eyes fell on the wine, which had overflowed over the desk.


Okin stepped up and entered the room. He was early and it was silent. He sat in a different seat this time, across from the portait of Aredal. His eyes transfixed on it, and he tried to remember the details of the man's face from that day he arrived again-- he remembered his sharp silver eyes and hair, the way his tongue moved when he talked. Even though he had done this several times, on the portraits in the gallery below, he had to realize what was going on-- how their appearance could be so similar even though the man was not his God-- and secretly prayig for some dissimmilarity he could point out. He had asked some of his staff if they knew any other Bei-Sanians, if there was just many that looked similar, but the sample size was low.
"Greetings, Impalias Okin."
Okin jumped in his chair. He hadn't noticed the petite Mouth sitting calmly a few seats left of him.
"Oh! Hello, holy Mouth of the Gods. I--"
Okin looked to one of the empty chairs, where Vovwaq usually sat. Now would be an opportune moment to tell the Mouth what had happened-- such Corruption should not be taken lightly here.
"Yes?" the Mouth looked at Okin with eager eyes.
"I wanted to tell you about something before our meeting begins. Impalias Vovwaq came to visit me yesterday while I was at work in Whenran."
The Mouth smiled. "Vovwaq really does love being hospitable. I sometimes wonder if he would have been better off choosing Nexon."
Okin shook his head. "It wasn't just a normal visit. He tried to bribe me to change my vote in exchange for marking my Bravery."
The Mouth placed a hand over his chin. "I see. That's concerning."
"I do not mean to create division, but I think it right to tell the other Impaliases," Okin said.
The Mouth's lips puckered. "I don't think that would be necessary. As I said, I will reprimand him in private."
Okin was surprised at this, but before he could protest the other Impaliases started piling into the room. Vovwaq was one of the last to take his seat, and gave Okin a serious eye but nothing more. Okin felt the urge to tell them all, and didn't understand why the Mouth wouldn't tell the room, but he didn't want to disrespect the Mouth's command. Surely the Mouth would dish out the required punishment.
"Good morning," the Mouth said once the group had settled. "The same as last week, we will be continuing with the issue of whether the man who arrived from Bei-San is Aredal, Returned as per predicted by the prophecies in the Onorun. In the last count, Impaliases Ricartotten, Vovwaq, Levinor, Xohl'a, Volmunst, and Ovolo were in favor, while Impaliases Okin, Mathelin, Mikeol, and Henard were against."
"I guess if we are gauging opinions I should start," Mikeol raised his hand. "I was talking to Impalias Ricartotten and Ovolo after last weeks session, and we have been in conversation this week. And I'm not definite, but I think I'm leaning a bit more towards the for side, depending on how this meeting goes."
Okin eyes widened and he looked between Ricartotten and Ovolo. The former had a proud smile and a nod, while the latter retained his stern gaze. This was very concerning-- not an argument exchanged, and already things were looking more dire.
"And what fact changed your mind, if I may ask?" Henard raised a furry grey eyebrow.
"First-- Impaliases Ricartotten and Ovolo's knowledge on foreign affairs helped me realize how full of Vice the world is right now. The Citadel has been growing in holiness, though of course we have Vice among us-- but especially us who don't aren't directly on the front, or focusing on Marthia like Ricartotten is, sometimes forget that outside of our borders is a vast land of heretics. I feel like as the front has mostly moved to Wolstamm, I have forgotten about how much our neighbors hate us, and how their lives are controlled by Deception. What Ovolo shared with me-- what the leaders are doing in Farsun in Surkusch-- I can see how this is a time where Deceivers are rising. And though the distance and the Barrier Mountains might make it easy for us to forget about the east, Ricartotten reminded me that even more demonic entites may be waiting for us there. The entire kingdoms of GaoLei, _ and _ have been wiped out by some monstrous construct of the Darkness. And I'm sure Impalias Xohl'a could tell us more about the errors of the southeast. Point is-- Darkness is arising all around us, and it's been a thousand years now. Doesn't it make sense that now the Gods would Return to save us?"
The for Impaliases nodded, as did Henard. Okin considered the point before responidng: he had also heard reports from abroad, and especially from his new staff, of all the monstrosities that took place outside Versalist lands. The Gestalt, as many called it, was a demonic entity where people lost their own autonomy and were collectively controlled by a plant, and was spreading rapidly. What a Dark Corruption of the Citadel's idea of unity. And it was true, the western threat was growing, and they housed and protected Dark Heralds. But weren't the Vareeshi an equally degenerate threat?
"But this man /supports/ the Dark ideologies of the east," Okin said. "He wants us to join him in a /Vareeshi/ tradition-- /Virtue and Vice cannot be united, neither can Versalist Truth and Wisdom with foreign Deceptions and Foolishness, just as the Four could not be at Peace amongst the Darkness: Neiman 4 2:8./"
"Perhaps he is just trying to give us a way to convert them more easily! Four know the Citadel hasn't supported the conversion of the east nearly enough, as I have been saying for years! This is finally a chance to get all of the east under Versalist law in one big move!" Ritarcotten said.
"My point still stands. By us joining them, in this way, they have more power and influence over us then we over them," Okin leant into the table.
"But perhaps you lack faith, young Okin," Levinor raised a wrinkly hand. "The Four will Return, they will victorious over the Darkness, and the world will see the Truth. We all believe that with our lives. Does your doubt resist you from moving with its happening?"
Okin shook his head. "But how do we know these are not the decievers the Onorun speaks of?"
"We must look at it carefully, to see the Truth and make a decision in Wisdom," Henard said. "Not a verse in the Onorun should be overlooked in this decision."
"Yes, and we are the Loyal Impaliases of the Citadel! We know we are speaking with our minds fixed to the Onorun! Most of you did not see him arrive-- I did. He performed amazing acts of Light, touching the hearts of the Citadel. And it was /Aredal/-- the Aredal I've seen walking into this hall for a decade--," Ovolo pointed at the painting just across from Okin. "It was like it came to life. Impaliases Okin and Henard, I am surprised that you both are against him when witnessing what I did with my own eyes."
"I must admit the resemblance was uncanny," Henard said. "But Impalias Okin had the closest interaction with him, and claimed that in the more important element-- the spirit of Aredal, rather than the appearance-- he was nothing like him at all."
"You did not mention this in our last meeting, Okin," Mikeol said.
"It's true," Okin said. "When I asked him about Tregale's return, he only mentioned that we should join his pyramid to defeat him-- and he said that not only does he intend to wipe out, but that he hates Tregale. Do I need bear repeating the verse we all know? /As the embodiment of Compassion, he hated no one, not even his enemies./"
Henard and Levinor spoke the verse in unison with Okin.
"You asked him directly?" Levinor said. "Whether he hates Tregale? And he said yes?"
Okin nodded.
"I do not see it as unholy that the man declares himself as an enemy of the Darkness," Ovolo said.
Okin sputtered. "B-but the text says it itself! /Neiman 1 4:4: He hated no one, not even his enemies!/"
"That is a surface-level reading, Impalias Okin," Vovwaq spoke for the first time since Okin and his encounter in Whenran. The Impaliases heavy, cheek-filled voice which before had been disarming now pricked Okin's skin. "Tregale and the Darkness are more than an enemy. As you quoted this meeting, /the Four could not be at Peace amongst the Darkness/."
Ovolo and Volmunst nodded.
"Yes. I do not see it as a flaw that he is determined to save the people from Tregale," Volmunst said. "As the Onorun promises."
"Do not let your personal view of Aredal cloud our judgement," Ovolo added.
"It's /not/ my personal view," Okin said. "It's what the Onorun says. And even if the hatred wasn't a problem, he spoke nothing like Aredal-- it is said that Aredal was second in Humility only to Olitheon, and his Temperance demanded no worship. Yet this man said to your face, Impalias Ovolo, that he was glad you came to observe his majesty. And Aredal is the embodiment of absolute Truth, regardless of any opinion, yet when you asked him to justify himself he only cited the opinion of the people."
"You are reaching for points-- I see no problem in Aredal recognizing that he is majestic above us, and pointing out that the people that arrived their before us recognized him. And you seek to judge a man that appears to be your /god/ based on only a small conversation," Ovolo said.
"Exactly! We have only heard him for minutes and yet he has already said three things that contradict the spirit of Aredal we know!" Okin cried out. "Do you not remember, /spirit is more crucial than appearance, as the Darkness can manipulate the appearance?/"
"Yes, spirit is more crucial then appearance-- but it still tells us it was /him!/ It is true, there are deceivers, but they are those who see impurely. The Gods made this reality. Why would they destin us, their Loyal believers, to fall for such a convincing trap! He was surrounded by Light-- there is no way there could be any Illusions of the Darkness. I do not see how this can be a Deception!," Ovolo shouted.
"It seems we are not getting anywhere," Mikeol held his hands between Okin and Ovolo. "It is emphasized to us followers of Olitheon that Wisdom and Curiosity flow into each other," the bald Impalias held out both hands and rotated them like he was holding an invisible ball. "Curiosity grows Wisdom by being open to any information, only neglecting that which Wisdom deems impossible. I feel like I am in the middle. I ask everyone at the table to think about what evidence would make them change their opinion now."
"That sounds like a good idea," the Mouth nodded.
The Impaliases drifted into thought-- some hands tapped against the table, some rested their chin on one arm, some looked off into the void.
"If we join him-- and he betrays us, or subverts the Citadel to the Vareeshi, or any other foreign power," Ovolo said.
"If you think that-- why should we declare that he is Aredal-- something we surely cannot go back on-- if we don't *know*!? Maybe we should consider removing you as lead general, if you're so willing to take such disastrous risks!" Mathelin shouted.
Ovolo's eyes curved in on Mathelin and gave a snarl that nearly made Okin defecate. The smaller Impalias visibly whitened. "YOU QUESTION--"
"Impalias Mathelin-- we are listening to everyone's breaking point," the Mouth stepped in, raising his staff. "Go on, Impalias Levinor."
Mathelin looked away. Okin somewhat respected that the little Impalias had the Bravery to stand up to a fearsome general like Ovolo, without even being of Aredal.
"Though as of now we are voting on opposite sides, I agree with young Impalias Okin. If he does show himself to be against the spirit of my god, then he is a deceiver. And on the other side, if he continues to be an inspiration of Light, it as the Onorun says," Levinor said. Okin's skin prickled. He found the older Impalias of Aredal to be an inspiration, but why did the man not agree that the obvious contradictions between their god and the man who had arrived.
"Impalias Xohl'a?"
Okin's eyes moved from Impalias to Impalias. Their answers were reasonable, but nothing that truly struck Okin. Xohl'a: if he clearly betrayed any of the Virtues, especially Aredal's. Ricartotten: Same as Xohl'a. Mikeol would say he was Aredal if he performed similar feats of power and goodness as in the Onorun, and not if he fell short. Volmunst was vague, saying that none who were not gods could pretend to be one.
"Impalias Vovwaq?"
Okin's jaw tensed every time he heard the fat Impalias' name now. With Vovwaq's Corruption, it seems the game was unwinnable until he was gone.
"Well, let's look at the facts. The facts say that Aredal will Return, in Bei-San, that he had silver eyes and silver hair, that it will be during a time of turmoil, that there will be deceivers in the Citadel, and that he would make not just himself beam with unending power, but also could truly feel others and thus give them unending power as well. Did this man Return? Yes, reports say as a fully grown man, as we would expect. Is this man from the Bei-San region? Yes, and he was recognized as their leader, which is understandable as we know of all the great works Aredal performed for his people. Is this a time of turmoil? That is more debatable, but our Impaliases on our borders say yes. Is there deceivers in the Citadel?"
At this one he paused, raised an eyebrow and looked around.
"Perhaps, those who oppose him, are. Not that those who vote against here are, but those who will oppose Aredal in the time to come. And we know from our citizens, that he gave people endless powers they did not before possess, and they felt known by him. That is why I hold my position."
Okin's teeth clenched as Vovwaq raised his saggy chin. But as much as he hated it, everything Vovwaq had said was correct-- and though he already knew the facts, hearing them out loud like this really made him start to doubt. Was his steadfastness against the man from Bei-San really True?
"Impalias Okin?"
Okin swallowed. What would make him change his mind? Of course, of course, he would feel overjoyed if Aredal really did Return during his lifetime. It would be a blessing second only to the Fourth heaven itself. But still, he hadn't escaped that Dark feeling inside his chest since he met the man. Why would he feel that if it was his god, who was Compassionate before all?
"Wait," Okin said. "I thought we would saying what would make us change our mind. Impalias Vovwaq just listed his own points."
The circle's eyes turned back to Vovwaq.
"Good catch, Impalias Okin," Vovwaq said. "Leaders are forced to make decisions. I'm sure we'll see whether his leadership matches that which we know of Aredal in the War of the Gods. If it does not-- my mind will change."
The Impaliases nodded, seeming to accept his answer and turned to Okin.
"I-- I--"
The piercing eyes pulled down a bead of sweat from Okin's forehead.
"I don't know."
Vovwaq cleared his throat. "All due respect, Impalias Okin. But I thought you would have your own answer after calling me out for not giving one," Vovwaq said. Okin had to look away from the man-- if he he stared into his little grey eyes one second longer, he felt like he would blow up.
"I agree. How can we trust your judgement, young Okin, if there is no way you would change your mind? If you believe this is a deciever, how would you even accept Aredal, when he does arrive?" Volmunst's body turned to overshadow Okin's.
"I-- I believe he has already broke the Virtues, as I explained earlier. However, I am not infinitely Wise, and perhaps my judgement is wrong. I will send him a letter and perhaps he will correct me," Okin said. "And my mind may be changed."
The room was silent at Okin's answer, and Ricartotten and Ovolo shook their heads dissapprovingly. Okin's heart sank-- he hoped it was not Pride, but he didn't like feeling as he did the first day, as he did now-- an unqualified junior among the Impaliases of the Citadel.
The Mouth kindly directed attention to Henard.
"Impalias Vovwaq made many great points, and I believe his method is exactly what we should be using. But we need to go deeper, and I advise every one on this council to think through this issue more thoroughly. Every line in the Onorun that speaks of Aredal can act as a criteria, and if he seems to fail any, we should strongly consider the fact he may an agent of Tregale or Deionis. That being said, if he meets every one-- I will Joyfully claim him as my god," Henard said. As usual, the Impalias of Aredal spoke with precision, tact, and logic.
The Impaliases' eyes turned to the last in the circle-- Mathelin, who had been uncharacteristically quiet this meeting. The short Impalias pipped up from his slumped posture.
"Unlike usual, I've tried to be less-- brash and outspoken in this discussion-- uh, besides my outburst. I apologize," Mathelin looked to Ovolo. "I've been reminded that rage is conducive to Foolishness."
Mathelin nodded to Mikeon.
"But that does not mean I lack opinion! I want to see proof in this man's actions that he is Aredal. So far, he has been here for a few years, according to some reports, but has not interacted much with anyone. It is said that /the Light of Aredal was radiant, none could look upon him and admit him a normal man, or be left unchanged by him/. And we all know the story of Aredal and Revictus. Therefore, this man must change hearts towards holiness if he is our holy Aredal. And, as of now... well. I hear reports his nation adores him, but that is to be expected. But I am also not deaf to the cries of Joy within the walls of the Citadel. If he changes even the Vareeshi-- that may well convince me."
Henard nodded. "That is an important criteria, and you are well balanced in your analysis."
"It is also said that /Aredal could not help but heal the hearts of men, for his Compassion was unyielding/. You said it yourself, he has sat in Bei-San for years doing hardly anything," Okin looked at Mathelin, before turning his eyes back to the center. "I never entertained the rumors about this leader because I knew that our God, especially my holy Aredal, wouldn't corner himself off in some foreign nation without reaching a hand out in Compassion to those who have been longing for his return."
"So you are letting your own personal previous judgements Corrupt our process of making Just, Wise, and Truthful decisions as a council?"
Okin's eyes narrowed like a hawk to the commenter. Vovwaq. Okin wasn't sure if he was just imagining the Corrupt Impalias' smug grin. Tempting him. How dare /he/, of all people, call Okin's judgement's /Corrupt/?
Okin was about to open his lips when his gaze fell on the Mouth. The man did not look stern, but in his kind eyes he could see a worry, like a disabled grandfather who was witnessing his infant grandchild about to do something dangerous.
He glanced back to the rest of the table. Vovwaq had folded his hands, and everyone's eyes were on Okin.
"You are bold to call me Corrupt, Impalias Vovwaq," Okin's lip shook. The rest of the table moved back and forth between Vovwaq and Okin. "After trying to bribe me in my own country."
"What are you talking about, Okin?" Mikeol looked at the Impalias.
"Okin-- I said I would deal with this," the Mouth's voice raised in warning.
For just a moment-- Vovwaq gentle smile had turned to a steaming glare. Quickly, the Impalias widened his eyes in confusion, and then an opening of the mouth in realization-- all an obvious act to Okin.
"He met me yesterday in my office in Whenran and tried to get me to change my vote. Offering to mark me in Bravery if I did so," Okin said.
Xohl'a gasped. "Is this true, Vovwaq? How could you, as a man of Olitheon?" Mikeol asked.
"Impalias Okin is mistaken," Vovwaq spoke calmly. "Yes, I did come to him. But I was merely came to compliment him and tell him that I saw Bravery in him and would be happy to recognize it upon further discussion. I believe he misinterpreted what I was saying."
"That is nonsense!" Okin shouted. First Vovwaq came to him, now outright lies? How was this man an Impalias of the Citadel, with Four recognized Virtues no less?
"ENOUGH! I had told Impalias Okin this would be discussed privately," the Mouth turned to Okin. "You are an Impalias now, but even an Impalias must remember his place."
The other Impaliases stared between Okin and Vovwaq. It seemed they were unsure of who to believe. /Oh, if only they knew the Truth!/
"I understand. I just thought that from layman to Rothar to Impalias, the approval of Virtue and the condemnation of Vice should be spread," Okin said.
The Mouth sighed. "I understand, Impalias Okin. I want us all to listen to Impalias Henard and be more thoughtful in our contributions here, both opinions and how we express them to our fellow Impaliases. I understand this may be the biggest issue the Citadel has ever faced, and am blessed by this honor, as you all should be, but I hope it does not divide us further."
Okin looked down as the votes were taken. For: Ricartotten, Ovolo, Volmunst, Vovwaq, Levinor, Xohl'a-- Mikeol. Seven in total. Things were getting worse, and the new Impalias didn't feel particularly blessed. His mentor had died, and he had taken a place which he was wholly unqualified for, and in two meetings he had gone from stressed but optimistic to it seeming like most of his colleagues were against him. Was he rejecting his own god? He prayed to him, that it was not the case, that and that Okin's role would be more clear.
* Chapter VIII
"Please, I thought my secretary would have told you, I am not taking meetings today," large bags weighed down Okin's face, almost keeping him glued to the page he was writing on.
"I'd never thought this was how we'd be meeting again," a croaky, yet charming feminine voice spoke.
Okin read with his moving pen, /Lopamu Infantii training for all three wings will be transported to.../ when his hand released his pen in a sudden drop.
He looked up gradually, his eyes intent.
"Liejuett," his mouth and eyes were frozen spheres as he stared across at the striking woman that stood between the bookshelves of his office doorway. Even though Othars wore deemed to wear headdresses and robes that obscured most feminine features, and were forbidden from wearing makeup of any kind, Liejuett still shimmered with a beautiful blush.  Her eyes fluttered with her movements in grace that gave her a gracious, slow aura, as if cherry blossom petals were falling around her at all times-- a memory Okin saw on replay. She was many places to him-- a convenient log on the side of a windy pond, the dilpidated end of dock on the far side of town, an overgrown cliff overlooking the port town.
"May I come in, /Impalias/ Okin? Or do you want me to haggle with your secretary again?" She spoke the title in a fake deep voice, and giggled.
"Come in," Okin's mouth barely moved, uttering the words in an airy breathe. He shook his head wildly and let out a deep groan. "Sorry. Long night."
"I would expect. Not like pretending to bless Devinars on the war front, but really taking a big long vacation with ol' Previa?" She placed her hands atop the desk and gave him a mischievious smile.
"Liejuett! That's--" Liejuett giggled again, and Okin blushed.
"Always too serious. From Impalias, to Infantii, down to when you were an actual infant," Liejuett stared around at the office and its surrounding bookshelves. Though Okin was usually a clean freak, every nook was stuffed with random scrolls and other paperwork, and there was an uncleaned ink spill on the carpet. Liejuett obviously noticed.
"Lot of work, eh? See, you try to take a lazy route, and then catch on and give you the hardest position in the Citadel," Liejuett wagged her finger at Okin.
"It furthers my respect for Impalias Aldwin, if that was even possible. I don't know how he kept up a warm front-- I struggle even with you here," Okin pursed his lips as he finished the sentence. He had always been more talkative around Liejuett.
"Aldwin was a good man, even if he always ruined our fun plans."
"Is, Othar Liejuett," Okin said.
Liejuett looked down. "I was devastated when I heard what happened. Is Previa doing all right?"
"Emotionally, he's handling it better than I thought he would," Okin said. "But he's joined an extremist faction-- I suspect in response."
"Well, everyone grows up at different speeds," Liejuett said. "Not everyone can be serious Rothar-in-training Okin right out of the womb."
"No one I meet in the Citadel is serious anymore. You, Previa-- even the Mouth of the Gods," Okin said.
"Really?" A crooked smirk appeared on Liejuett's lips.
"Like you wouldn't expect. I mean, he still holds authority and can be stern when he wants to be. But yeah, he acts like one of those old, too nice Infantii who never had kids of his own but regretted it and became one so he could work with them," Okin said.
Liejuett smiled. "Was that an Okin joke? As unfunny as I remember."
Okin glowered at Liejuett and bit his lip.
Liejuett's eyes widened. "I--"
Okin snorted. A wide grin appeared on his face.
"You!" Liejuett hit Okin on the shoulder before play-hitting Okin on the shoulder. Liejuett was always more feisty then what was often acceptable for a girl, and though Okin was usually uncomfortable when people strayed to far from the norms, he had always been comfortable with her. Unlike other loudmouths, Okin felt more a part of Liejuett's antics. "You can't do that now that you're Impalias!"
"Maybe not a comedy bard, but I could've been an actor in one of Doshtoff's plays," Okin beamed.
"I would've left my post as an Othar to come see you every day," Liejuett said. Her voice was still high in jest, but her eyes sparkled with true appreciation. The last time Okin had saw that look as a teenager, he had ran for the hills in an awkward effort to retain Temperance. This time, he had a lot more self control and the only had a slight delay in his smile.
"Okay, okay, Liejuett. It's nice to see you, but what are you doing here?"
"Well officially, I'm here to thank you for financing the weapons shipment from Apathasaw--"
"That was you?"
Liejuett nodded. "I'm not the only one who has moved up a lot since we met. But I'm also here to show you another proposal we have in the works, this one an improvement to our Herald-powered freighters, optimizing our own designs as well as Kaihan's and Apathasaw's."
Okin grabbed the blueprint from Liejuett and held it up to the window light. "I don't understand the technicals, but this is great. Mathelin and Xohl'a will love to see this. But I thought you were focused on theory and education?" Okin asked.
"I do, but engineering is the only thing you old men get excited about," Liejuett said. "And hey, a performer plays for a crowd who pays."
Okin nodded. Despite her outward silliness, Okin always respected Liejuett's realism and competence, unlike someone like Previa. The Virtues of Creativity and Joy shone from her in a true way, not as a facade to hide other Vices, like many of Nexon he knew. She was one of the few of Nexon that went into sciences, usually reserved for followers of Olitheon, or occassionally Aredal or Intillia.
"But the work is just that, the work, it doesn't have much to do with us and would happen whether either of us were here right now," Liejuett tilted her head while still staring at the side of Okin's head, where the little hair he had was sharply cut. "And if you weren't here I would've just sent a lower Istar to deliver the message."
There was an air of silence as their eyes passed over each other. Liejuett scratched the top of her headdress-- Okin remembered exactly how her red curls clumped and swirled down the back of her neck. He was never good at reading people, but his lack of response was killing her. And he didn't want this night to end yet.
"Do you want to come to Metheno for me for a night? As an Impalias, I can get us portaled there in minutes," Okin said. "For memory's sake."
Liejuett's green eyes sparkled again. "Is that how Impalias Okin chooses to use his portal perks?"
"Well yes," Okin stood up and led Liejuett to the door. "Metheno's an important city, and "
"It'll be a busy night. Of course, one cannot do business in Trenta without first visiting the dockmaster. Then, as usual with any city, I'll go to the head of town management. After that, the accountant who heads trade tax," Okin said.
Liejuett smiled.
"But of course not really. I won't actually be seeing any of them."
Liejuett rolled her eyes, but a crooked smirk remained on her cheek. Okin didn't like making jokes much, as they often involved lies, even though the Citadel of course made it an exception.
Okin told the portaller in the living room that he was going to Metheno, and they waited for about forty seconds as he made a new portal. They walked in and entered another place-- this one, a dark castle, and met another portaller there, who took another minute or so to open one to Metheno.
The portal had opened up in a small stone slab corridor, though there was no one to receive them except the tiny purple Crystal used to waymark the location for the portaller in the castle. Liejuett smirked at snoring coming down the hallway-- likely the Metheno portaller, as the end nodes weren't required to be awake at this time.
They slid past the sleeping portaller's room into a wide, square hall, with four thick mats that stretched several horses' length in each direction each knelt before a candlelit altar gilded in a different shimmering color-- Purple, Green, Orange, and a Rainbow hue.  Though since then he had dedicated himself to the Citadel as a clergyman, and risen from Rothar all the way to Impalias, it was under the four converging pillars of this wooden building that he had felt the most reverent. He remembered kneeling on the mats, with his four fingers clasped and his thumb hidden behind his palm, not distracted by the shuffling of the other children, and even adults, but fully focused for the entire service, entirely focused on his Gods.
"I missed this place," Liejuett said, leading Okin on the colored tiles just outside the mat. "Except the Broton brother's nonsense."
Okin nodded. The Broton's had the mixture of Envy and Lust that often characterized teenage attractions. Okin had to struggle to not feel too dignified by their punishment, lest it turn into Wrathful feelings.
Liejuett looked back and smiled at Okin as they strolled to the entrance of the church. He held open the door for her.
Even though as an Impalias he was in and out of churches, and surrounded by holy symbols every waking moment, and he was not one of those fools who did not realize the Gods were everywhere, controlling and sustaining reality regardless if their holy symbols were present or not, Okin felt like he could truly speak to them at this moment. /Am I doing right by you?/ is all he could ask before his heart reminded him to follow Liejuett.
Torch light came up from the dock, though the holders were mostly tired men who were forced to unload the ships an hour too late. Okin felt the weight of their heavy eyes pull him down-- every decision he made poorly made /these/ mens lives', and millions like them, harder. Liejuett ran up to Okin, so they were walking side-by-side, and he felt himself caught between her bright innocence and the heavy labored wrinkles of the dockworkers.
He wasn't comfortable to turn directly to either, so he just stared at the algae-covered floorboards. It may have just looked like an empty dock, but it was really a deep portal into the past. Okin saw happy-go-lucky children and stern, all too serious young Devinars-- much taller than his youthful stature-- run by him, each immerssed in their own daily mission. Tired sailors being overwhelmed by grabby crowds salivating over the shiny gems from Golzen and foreign spices from Rilliola. Deldin being knocked into the water and everyone having a laugh except his mother. Giving a warm hug to his father's good friend, who he had come to know as an uncle, who's family was leaving on a boat to Neixilee'i. And-- worst, but deepest of all, taking in the stench of brine and salt just to look over the seas, where Billy and Damin had gone, and stir in his head for the four hundredth time whether he should wish they had drowned, as they were of the Darkness, and against all Virtue, or whether he wished they were fine and would come back, as they were his friends, and just two little boys.
"Whatchu thinking about?" Liejuett peeked her head into Okin's periphery and the Impalias realized he had been awkwardly staring out dark blanket of ocean.
"Oh. Well," Okin's mind hurdeled over that temptation to lie, like a trained athlete hurdling over a pebble. "I was thinking about all the people I saw here. And mostly, Billy and Damin."
Liejuett pursed her lips. "That was-- "
"The Dark Herald and his brother," Okin finished her thought.
"Yeah," Liejuett paced away from him in a circle. "That was a long time ago, Okin."
"I thought I saw him recently. I thought I saw him come out of the smoke when Aldwin was shot," Okin said.
Liejuett gasped-- she was never one to hide her reactions.
"He's the reason I'm here now," Okin said. "And I'm the reason he was there. I ruined his life."
"If he killed Aldwin, it proves that he's been taken by the Darkness," Liejuett said.
"Or he's just taking revenge on him for executing his father," Okin's eyes didn't leave the moist void that was the ocean.
"Okin, they were hosting the Darkness!" Liejuett shouted. "You did the right thing!"
"Did I?" Okin turned to her. "If I hadn't Aldwin would still be alive right now!"
"Is this really you, honest Okin, thinking like this?" Liejuett asked. "First: you don't know that! The Darkness could have claimed several more lives beside his here if Aldwin didn't put a stop to it. And second, that's not the way to think! We can only be responsible for fighting the Darkness. We aren't responsible for what the Darkness does-- as well as those who support it."
"You say that, but I don't remember fighting the Darkness-- I remember a little boy. I remember the day I told Aldwin-- what were we doing? We were playing. An older boy, still only up to my chest, but older than him-- pushed him to the ground. And there, from his hands, yes, came a monstrous beast full of Darkness. But the boy-- he still had the wide, scared eyes of a child. He was as scared of the beast as we were."
Liejuett shook her head. "I know it is hard. There could be no harder temptation given-- especially to a man as Compassionate as you are," she smiled and placed a hand on Okin's shoulder. "But we must remember-- it is a temptation. /Tregale and Deionis are so evil, that--/"
"/That they would even attempt to Deceive the Compassion of Aredal, the Care of Nexon, the Charity of Intillia, and the Sacrifice of Olitheon, they would attempt to Decieve these Virtues that have been placed into your hearts, as they spread their evil. Always remember, that giving these Virtues to the Darkness takes them away from the rest of the world, the world formed by the Gods, as the Darkness is not of the Gods. To give into this temptation is not of the Virtues, but an act of Foolishness, Deception, Treason, and Destruction/," Okin finished the line for Liejuett, without skipping a beat. She stared at him, impressed. "I said that passage to myself thousands of times after Billy and Damin fled."
Okin sighed. He had been taken out from the weight of his new job, back to the weight of his past. And now, seeing something as innocent as an empty carriage brought him back to both. He remembered how his friend's dad had lost his livelihood and ended up in jail after hijacking and stealing a carriage of food. He had been a local portermaster who had been outcompeted after a new Space Guild depot was constructed to connect the major cities in Whenran to encourage local trade in higher volumes. At the time, he wasn't aware of the economics, and it had been a tragedy he had prayed about, and a lesson to still not engage in Vices, even in the worst of times. But now he knew that this decision came onto an Impalias' desk, and either with a whole lot of thinking, or none at all, he signed it, and indirectly ruined that man's life. How many lives had Okin ruined already?
Okin was taken out of his trance by what felt like a smooth peach fuzz on the back of his hand-- but he nearly jumped. He looked down to see Liejuett's hand-- and back up to see her soft green eyes, and a smile that was concerned yet warm.
"I know what you're thinking about, but I came to help you relax. All your stresfful decisions will still be there tomorrow. Just forget about it for a night."
/But how can I forget when it's all so crucial?/ The thought slapped back her warm approach-- until her delicate, pale fingers laced around his. Okin swallowed, before nodding. He felt nothing but her finger against his innermost being. A jolt of energy shot from his elbow through to it. He hadn't felt the temptations of Lust since before he was an Infantii, but a wave of memories flashed into his mind. A quick glance through an open window at long auburn hair. An apprehensive fist inches from the front door and then a quick retreat out of the yard. Watching as she giggled amongst a group of friends. Facing each other-- reaching for a delicate hand. Panicking, heaving, running away. A friendly wave as she sat on a cart driving out of town.
His body stiffened. Would he run away this time, again, not as an awkward teenager, but as a thirty year old man-- and now, one of the dozen most powerful men on the continent? His heart pounded as he stared into her eyes-- it seemed so loud to him, that he was surprised that she could not hear it, that she just smiled calmly at him, that she could not tell he was wrestling with Vice, regretting old memories, and totally intimated by both her and the moment.
He got the Bravery to stare into her eyes-- until they stared right back where they normally do-- into the pages of the Onorun.
/Temperance is not always mindless renunciation.../
Okin's gaze lowered the slight pink pillows under her nose, which opened ever so slightly at his gaze. He wanted that opening to widen, for them to surround him...
Okin's entire body followed his gaze until they lowered to stare at Liejuett's lap, but really, into the void.
"We should go home now," Okin said, just as he felt Liejuett's body inch closer to his.
He looked back at her and saw her mirror the exact position he had just a second ago-- the lifeless stare of deep thought.
"/...but it is taking the middle road. The road of reason, contemplation, and patience./"
"But-- please come back again. I do want to do this again."
Liejuett's empty stare turned into a bright red smile. "I will."
They walked back to the sleeping portaller with his wrist wrapped around hers.


"WE WILL NOT BOW TO DECIEVERS! WE WILL NOT BOW TO THE FALSE *LIGHT*! WE HOLD THE VIRTUES OF CITADEL LAW! WE WILL NOT BOW TO THE FALSE *LIGHT!* OUR WORSHIP IS TRUE! OUR WORSHIP IS PURE! WE WILL NOT BOW TO THE FALSE LIGHT!"
The tall, rectangular buildings surrounding the Citadel streets made a vice of shouts which squeezed in on Okin's ears. The Impalias, though he outranked all the other marchers, appeared like a child with a hunched back and fingers on his ears. The group was relatively small compared to how much noise they made, and the bystanders around them moved like flies-- some darting away, some being traped by the honey and joining in.
As they reached an open intersection, the front of the march stopped and the squeezed in and blobbed out. Previa was at the head, clad in in his White Anti-Herald armor, which Okin saw as an adolescent overcompensation-- the full set was worth ten crystals, or even more. Enough to feed a whole family for years.
The group had brought a makeshift stand, really just two blocks of wood. Previa stepped up on it and lowered his visor.. He pumped his fist in the air, and the crowd cheered.
"Istars, Rothars, Devinars, and layman of the Citadel!" Previa cupped his armored hands over his mouth. "We are here because we are the citizens of Versalism. We are here because we are the defenders of the Citadel--," Previa pointed to the Four statues and the central cathedral, "the cathedral," he pointed out to the street and above, where the massive walls encapsulated the city, "the city," he raised his arms high and wide, "and of all the believing lands from the Farsunni front to the Barrier Mountains. "
In a private class, or a formal study of the Onorun, Previa was as lost as a Hierhersan child. But when it came time to deliver a big speech-- he always managed to seem like the most passionate believer.
"And we have a special surprise for you. We are not alone! The ally I have told you about-- the one who told me about his own conversation with the False Light, confirming his Vices-- he is here."
The crowd shouted and raised their fists. Okin gulped.
"My father, Impalias Aldwin of Whenran, was tragically attacked in /this very square/. But the deceivers were too short-sighted to expect my father to pick honest Okin as his replacement-- and he's here to tell you about the Corruption we're all going to root out together!"
The crowd cheered as Previa motioned for Okin to join him on the stand. Okin stood, frozen, and glanced up at the massive statue of Olitheon, casting a shadow over the group, and the towering Citadel structure behind it. Surely, the Mouth of the Gods could /hear/ him from here. What would it look like, if an Impalias heading out of the central cathedral caught him ramping up a crowd against their very authority. Okin was starting to regret the promise he made to the Devinar.
"Come on, Okin! They're waiting for you!" Previa held out his long, gauntleted arm. Okin thought back to the little school boy he knew, with the same wide eyes encouraging the other kids to run outside when they weren't supposed to. Anyone smart knew it was never a good idea to listen to that kid.
"That's alright, Devinar Previa! I was not planning to speak today. You're doing an excellent job," Okin replied.
The surrounding crowd booed.
"He probably supports that Deceiver from the east!"
"He may look younger, but he's one of them!"
At even the first shift into negative reactions, Previa had already turned back to the crowd, seeking to change the tide.
"That's all right," Previa held out his gauntleted hands. "Impalias Okin is on our side, he just--"
"What a COWARD!"
Okin's fist clenched, and his arms shook. His mind was brought back to the Farsunni front, to making the decision to go there, through staying up all the nights imagining the worst situations where he could be Brave-- and in the end just floundering and being discharged. Here again, would he let Previa be Brave but ultimately fail without the support he needed?
"I am fighting against the deceiver every day!" Okin shouted. He had enough of rowdy know-it-alls, from the Impalias high court to the streets, who just spat out lies based on nothing. The crowd silenced.
He shoved his way onto the stand, pushing Previa off, even though the man weighed over double with his armor.
"You are right. I believe Corruption has infected even the highest levels of the Citadel, as I have told Previa."
The crowd jeered.
"And we are voting on whether this man is Aredal-- and it is rushed. And we do not know anything. And when I talked to this man, he. Did. Not. Seem. Like. Our. God!"
The crowd exploded in aggreement.
"Name names! Which of the Impaliases support this false GOD?!"
Okin turned in the direction of the heckler. "I am still an Impalias and my holy duty is still True. I am allowed to tell you my opinions, but I cannot reveal confidential Citadel votes."
The crowd booed again.
"COWARD!"
"Stop it!" Previa had stepped up to the stand again, and Okin used it as a que to step down. "Impalias Okin is on our side!
"How do we know that when he won't tell us anything?" A heckler shouted.
Previa looked down at Okin and motioned for him to return to the stand. /Give them something more/, his eyes said.
"For any of you that are doubting, this is not empty talk. I will let you know that an Impalias tried to bribe me to change my vote on the issue," Okin stepped back up. The crowd gasped.
"I knew it! Tell us who it is!"
Okin paused as he saw the animalistic faces of the crowd. As always, when any matters like this came up, he remembered with the Onorun said, that Truth must always be spoken. However, the Impalias' voting, under normal circumstances, was confidential. But Vovwaq had come to him outside of
"What will you do if I let it be known?" Okin croaked at the crowd.
"He is a DECEIVER who seeks to give the Citadel over to the DARKNESS! WE WILL KILL HIM!" A heckler shouted.
"WE'LL KILL HIM!" voices in the crowd screamed in agreement.
"I cannot let that happen," Okin said. He had said he would stand by his duty, and he wouldn't feed this Wrathful crowd. He stepped down from the stand.
Previa made his way back up as the crowd booed Okin. "D-do not worry! Whoever it is, Justice will come to them. Impalias Okin is just making sure that it is done through the holy law of the Citadel! That we do not turn to Wrath!"
Okin pushed through to the edge of the crowd, blocking out all sights and sounds around him.
"The Impaliases have turned against us! Just as the Onorun predicted!"
Okin took a sharp breathe-- a hand clutched his arm. Three more pairs of arms reached out for him. Okin yanked his body away in his panic, and covered his eyes.
He looked through his fingers and saw another robed man, stand between them, blocking the approachers.
"The Citadel's eyes are upon us. Let us not engage in Vice today," the robed man said.
The three men pushed just past the defender's arm, and then stepped back. They nodded to each other and dispersed back into the crowd, as if nothing had happened.
Okin's breathe had exploded to the pace of a hummingbird. As soon as he registered his own panic, it was covered by a heavier coat of shame. These were not even the brutal raiders of Farsun-- he, an Impalias, had been shook by three ordinary citizens of the Citadel.
"Thank you," Okin hobbled forward and whispered as the man turned back to Previa, taking a stand in front of the Impalias. He did not respond back.
For the rest of the protest, Previa gave a standard speech. He repeated the talking points he had told Okin several times, standard, solid ones, but predictable, some even similar to ones Okin had brought up in the meeting. In the end, he claimed that though there were deceivers, the Onorun promised that Versalism was eternal and their movement was proof that the False Light could not win. The crowd gradually dispersed and the once angry, loud mass whittled itself down to a few dozen quiet clappers.
Okin stood on the sidelines, directly underneath the massive statues' shadow, alongside the robed man who had stepped in to defend him. He was grateful that someone-- surprisingly, only an Athar, judging by his robes-- had done so. Okin wasn't exactly supposed to be here, and his security was probably wondering where he was.
As the last word was said and Previa stepped down from the stand, held out his hand for Okin to shake, and Okin took it. "Athar Misthiel."
His long white robes were adorned with long, thin golden triangles, indicative of an Athar of Aredal. Long, thick black hair hung over his eyes-- quite an unusual groom for a member of the clergy. His head was oddly shaped, being quite a bit larger and wider than the rest of his body.
"Thank you again, Athar Misthiel," Okin said. "I did not expect this to be so rowdy, but I should have known with Previa. Are you just observing?"
"Well I may not be as rowdy as the rest of them, but I just as firmly believe in True Light, and am one of the organizers," Mistheil said.
Okin glanced over in the direction where Previa had gave the speech. The young Devinar was surrounded by a small group, shaking hands.
"You have a name, already?" Okin looked back to Misthiel.
"Yes. Because the man who arrived a month ago is the False Light, but the Onorun says Aredal is the Light and also Truth. So, we believe in True Light."
Okin showed Misthiel his palm, where his Virtues, Truth and Temperance, were marked. "I know, I know."
Misthiel chuckled. "Oh yes, I am sorry, Impalias. I help the Istars teach school children, so I'm used to overexplaining everything."
"I understand," Okin said. "Regardless, no matter how much I agree with the Truth of the matter-- I am worried if this is the energy your group cultivates."
"The people are angry and know something is wrong. They want to be recognized, and they're not thinking straight," Misthiel said.
"A hallmark of Wrath. And Foolishness," Okin replied.
"But yet they've come to the right conclusion?" Misthiel raised an eyebrow. "Haven't you said that?"
"Well, somewhat. I do not know what all these people think exactly. But yes, in terms of denying this deceiver, I agree. But, though I cannot name names, I can admit that on the voting level, our propsects do not look good," Okin said.
"But it is a unanimous vote, so as long as you are there, we are fine," Misthiel smiled. "And we know the Gods overcame things we would call impossible, and they are called by spirit, not argument. Perhaps praying together will give us strength and guidance."
Misthiel placed a warm hand on Okin's shoulder. Though he was awkward looking, it was rather disarming, and even though Okin's schedule was packed, an ally, and one who would pray with him, was something he desperately needed.
"That sounds wonderful," Okin said. "With permission I may be able to get you into the Impalias manor here."
"I thought maybe you would like a break from your usual places of business," Misthiel said. "I have a room just outside the inner wall-- no one would know looking at it, but it is a great silent place to pray."
Okin concluded that Misthiel must've been a logistics Athar of quite a large area and just helped the Istars in his free time; only someone who been there respected the stresses of a high administrative position and the desperation for quiet it demanded.
"It's not far from here. Why don't we go now, to calm down from this?"
Okin glanced at the man's hand as he motioned down the street. He saw three feint multicolored outlines of sharp triangles-- Bravery, Compassion, and Truth, judging by their position on the palm. That was more than Okin had.
Okin looked up at the sun to gauge the time-- he had just a bit more before he /had/ to be back in Whenran. He might as well save time by making two outings at once.
"Okay," he said and followed Mistheil down the busy main road.
As usual, the Citadel streets choked Okin. Men moved like stones in a whirlpool, and Okin was reminded why he had been so grateful for the priveledge of portal travel.
"He is here, the time is upon us, the time for change!" A vagabond raised his bony hands to the sky. He had not been the first in the street shouting praises of this new age, of the arrival of the man from Bei-San. "They have all been Decieved, from the Impaliases down to the lowest beggars," Mishthiel commented.
In general, besides the usual alienating bustle, and the occassional hymn from a Rothar shouting praises to the Four and blessings upon the Citadel, the air seemed different. Groups shot out in more desperate prayer, more passionate praising, as if a well of hot lava had burst up from beneath the cold crust of the Citadel. It was worrying, but Okin found himself not shocked, rather, alienated; all this rapid change from an ordinary Athar to the foremost prodigy of the Citadel, making decisions about the /Return/-- it was just too much change, that his mind just cast it all with the atmosphere of the surreal.
Okin and Mistheil went through the usual about Okin's new life as an Impalias, and a few spiritual matters, before returning to the topic of the True Lights.
"I do not think your faction can be taken very seriously, with Previa as its apparent leader," Okin said. "It's bad enough he's just a Devinar, but-- I have known him a long time, and he is not one for reliability. With the passion already infused in this debate, I think a more stable leader would serve you well."
Mishtiel nodded. "Here it is," he pointed and diverted to the side of the street. He lifted up his robes and took out a rusty key. He unlocked the door and held it open for Okin with a /squeak/. The building a few stories high and was made of tough, old stone, and would have been very worn if it was not.
"I apologize, it's a bit Dark. The stairs are solid, but you can keep a hand on me if you struggle to feel your way down," Misthiel said.
"That's alright", Okin said, but his mind was still on the conversation.
Misthiel unlocked another door, and the Dark staircase moved into a room with the dim, warm glow of candlelight.
"I bring people here to pray whenever I have the chance. I was just communing with another family before I went to the protest," Misthiel lead Okin to a group of prayer mats and sat down, cross-legged, his face dimly illuminated by the candles. The warm glow in the dark room shrunk Okin's world, and he noticed the details of everything as he always did when things became dark and small-- soft sillhouttes of urns, flower jars, shells-- memories and offerings of those who had prayed here.
"This is blessed. Do you own this place?" Okin sat down across from Misthiel.
Misthiel nodded. "While I think he has done a fine job growing the movement so far, I can see the Truth in what you said about Previa. People do know he is Impalias Aldwin's son, which gives credibility," Misthiel said. "But I do agree. He is too impulsive. He is good as a front man though-- youthful and energetic. Overall, I thank the Four he is with us."
Okin nodded. Perhaps he had been too critical of Previa-- though Aldwin was a great father, he had become very busy, and Okin thought of the young man somewhat like his pupil, somewhat like a son. But a parent-- especially one of Aredal, had to be Compassionate, too.
"Previa brings some of the most important things a clergy member can bring to the table-- Passion. And though sometimes he can lack respect for the order the Citadel establishes, he is ultimately honest and I believe he will recieve Truth soon," Okin said.
The dancing light of the candle flashed Misthiel's smile in and out of the Light; his mouth had kind lines that gave him an innocent look despite his eyes being covered by his floof of hair.
"But what we are both getting at is that the True Lights need many types of leaders for what is to come," Mistheil's countenance dipped down to the candle. "And I believe this may be a case where my prayers really are answered right in the room I am in."
Mistheil stared at Okin, and the Impalias' hand crumpled. Even though he was now technically higher rank than many of the older Athars and Krusadars he was meeting in the Citadel, and though they followed protocol and gave him the same respect as if he was an Impalias elected in normal circumstances, he still had felt like a junior; his natural inclination to take a respectful bow and be led in body and mind, to listen instead of lead, or at most to lead in moderation and just perform one's duties. That attitude had served him quite well-- even as an Athar, he was one of the youngest Athars in Whenran, and the only one he knew that became one at an age younger than thirty. Now, here, Misthiel was the one proferring his hands to Okin, expecting a decision made by true authority, a decision of grace or austerity. Could the man see Okin's inner trembles, that though he may be confident in doctrine, he was really lost?
"I-- I do not want to pick sides so soon," Okin said.
"But you already have, Impalias," Misthiel said. "/No one can straddle between the Gods and the Darkness./"
The man's hands stayed folded near the fire; he was a statue next to the wandering flame. /This man should have been Aldwin's replacement-- someone sure, and firm/, Okin thought, though at this point he knew little of the man, and he was not even from Whenran and thus would be invalid.
"It is not so simple," Okin said. "Our revelation is not perfect-- even the ten Impaliases, we move back and forth on this decision, and even those on one side are not there for the same reasons."
"The prophecies say that in the end there will be those that stay true to Versalism and fight the Darkness and those who join it-- that there may be /Traitors of the highest rank, in the least expected places/," Misthiel said. "Even the Gods did not see the manipulations of Tregale and Deionis, and the Treachery among their friends."
"Even considering the prophecy, I would be wary of such cynicism towards the Citadel that you are so determined to choose. /Intillia: A rebellious nature fosters Treachery/," Okin looked to Mistheil as the words left his lips. Though the two men were hunched over in prayer, and not a word was raised over the volume of a slight whisper, Okin knew a verbal spout had soaked over this warm prayer. Though believers usually prayed in silence, they were taught that a Disciplined one could pray in any situation-- even an argument.
Perhaps," Mistheil said. "We do not want to be led astray from the Citadel-- like the Farsunni heretics. I ask that you just consider that in the end there is only one Truth. And even the Impaliases can choose to align with it or against it, and thus, with the Darkness."
"You believe that the Impaliases who choose the man from the East are not of the Gods? And even the Mouth?" Okin asked. He had wrestled with the thought himself-- and even worse, if the man /was/ Aredal, would he be against his own God for denying him? How could that be, when he had Loyally dedicated his life, and followed the Virtues to the best of his ability, all that was required a believer?
"I believe I have made it clear," Mistheil said. "Previa told me that you were certain he was a Deceiver... I would think you would believe the same."
Okin turned away and clasped his hand over his mouth. Some of the Impaliases, namely Vovwaq, were likely making the decision based on more than the Truth and Wisdom of Onorun. But he knew that some had come to their decision based on their honest analysis. How could the Four punish them, or moreso, the believers who found themselves on the side of the True Lights or against them, when they were just trying to loyally follow the Onorun? Even the Onorun said that while the world would recieve Versalism gradually, its heart expanding from the Citadel, all men were given the choice of whether to follow the Gods and their Virtues-- and the book itself said no man could know the Truth of the Gods, but only seek and uphold it.
"No matter," Mistheil said. "As long as you are on our side, our beliefs in this matter are peripheral-- their fates will be left up to the Gods. What is central is that you believe the man from the east seeks to ruin the name of your God, and with that conviction stand as the highest-ranking member of the True Light."
"What are you asking me?" Okin had been conflicted that so many had changed the way they treated him the second he had become Impalias-- it wasn't just the obvious Corruption like Vovwaq, but the slight looks of calculation, the little offers, bowing and greetings just a bit too friendly and a bit too long. Calling it Corruption and Deception at its root sounded too harsh-- the fact was that as an Impalias Okin had the power for change, whether good or bad, and men would take advantage of it. But it did reek of those Vices, and the stench of them shriveled Okin's heart. Were holy Athars really so holy, or just conniving after their own interests?
"I do not mean to be so forward, but I saw your palm earlier. The Four have called you to a higher station-- and we are all sent to and fro, high and low, on the best course to develop our Virtues. You are already deeply rooted in Truth-- perhaps this is your opportunity to grow a branch into Bravery. I think that standing for True Light would show that."
Okin snapped back. "Another had offered me that exact thing-- and they had no holy motive."
"I do not know what you speak of," Mistheil craned his neck lower in his crouched position. The man was impossible to read in the dark, his floof of hair and plump cheeks yet thin lips obscuring any expression from a side profile. "I only seek to recruit as many as I can to the cause of stopping the Deceiver."
"It sounded shockingly similar to a bribe I had received earlier, even if it was from the opposite side."
"I did not intend to bribe you. I was merely stating how the Gods put you on this path, and the opportunities for growing the Virtues they provide," Misthiel said. His focus on spiritual growth reminded Okin of his school teacher during his teenage years, one of the three men most responsible for Okin's decision to become a Rothar. He had implanted that idea that it was always about development, about sticking the course, into Okin's heart. It was simply the Truth-- but now things felt different, as if they were at the end of things, as if treating these crisises as a training ground was simply too adolescent.
"And where do you find yourself in this movement? Was it you that sucked Previa in, knowing his advantages as the son of a popular Impalias, and a hearty yet naive one? Perhaps you saw it even more advantageous that that very Impalias was disposed and could not be used as a moderating force?" Though he fired accusations, Okin's voice remained stoic. The duty of Truth was to remain objective and not afraid, but not to devolve into belligerent Wrath.
"I thought he was your friend. Why you are so against his determination, a determination we need?"
"Precisely because he is my friend. I am afraid he has joined your movement out of a personal vendetta. "
"It is not my movement, Impalias, but the Gods'. "
"And what would you have me do? Relinquish "
"Does Impalias Mathelin keep quiet about recruiting sailors in Terellia? Does Impalias Ricartotten not take every opportunity to send missionaries to the east? The words you say in the central cathedral are for your ears only, but your responsiblity as an Impalias-- an Impalias of /Aredal/, is to Bravely speak Truth to your people."
It was a good point. Okin had rather zoned out the ocean of bureaucracy-- the paperwork which put a mask of ink over the real problems of Whenran, and focused entirely on the debate. Yet he confined that debate to the diamond walls of the central cathedral, and to the ten other men who sat within them. Even the cries in the street for or against the man from the east were placed into the same zone in his mind as cries for bread, or admonishings against the Darkness. He had forgotten that the first duty of the Impalias was as the ruler of his nation.
* Chapter IX
But it did not seem like the Mouth had done anything about Vovwaq.

"In our last meeting we discussed what would make us switch sides," Okin said. "I did not give one before, but I realized what would convince me now."
// make them ban dark heraldry, but really adopt all versalist law


Okin sighed as he stepped into the main cathedral lobby, where the paintings of all the gods were hung. Another full day, another unproductive meeting. At least this time his side hadn't lost any votes. But what would have otherwise been an enlightening deep dive into a specific section of the Onorun was just stressful and long-winded, given the stakes and heated environment the Impaliases had created. Usually in a classroom or between other Athars or Istars Okin could just leave a footnote if there was something he needed more Wisdom in, and later on his own time mine the passage for all its Truth, but now each point, each /word/ was a life and death tug where neither side would let go-- and it wasn't unwarranted. Okin was both loathed and yet protected his attachment to the issue-- in fact, he had stayed and argued with those Impaliases who would stick around before the Mouth told them that they were not allowed to remain in the central chamber after the debate had ended.
"...
If there was an Impalias who had a chance to bring
A familiar voice-- Henard. The Impalias was one of the only ones who contributed a lot that was actually enjoyable to speak to-- he always kept up with whoever he was talking to, and never pulled strawmans, insults, or any other rhetoric tactics in bad faith. He had given both Okin and the other side well-placed questions, while not being afraid to disagree but always speaking with respect.
"Are you doing alright, Impalias Okin?"
"I am-- exhausted," Okin said. "Ever since the guards told me, I was skeptical that Aldwin chose me. But now--" Okin shook his head, "I am sure it was some sort of mistake."
"You know Aldwin as well as I do. It is not like him to make mistakes like this," Henard said. Henard's kind blue eyes gave Okin a look of certainty. His expressions were reserved, yet not hidden or shy, just a good reassuring smile. It was exactly what Okin liked-- moderate politeness that could not be mistaken for flattery.
* Chapter X
"Tell me or I'll kill you all!" the attacker screamed and slashed his sword at Okin.
"I AM, I AM!" Tears rushed down Okin's face. "I voted against Synodontis. If your heart is so Dark, kill me then."
The attacker leveled his sword at Okin's neck. He lifted up Okin's chin. Okin gritted his teeth as a drop of blood buried itself out from the under its chin and hit the ground.
"Good to know, but that's not what I asked. Did /he/ vote against our God?"

"He is not our God," Okin said. "So he did not vote against him."
The man growled, whipped around, yanked Okin by the collar. His blade pressed into the side of Okin's neck, threatening to behead him.
"Listen. I'll give you one last chance and even put it in words you'll agree with. Did he--" the man hissed. "Did he vote for or against the fact that the Synodontis is Aredal?"
Okin looked down to Mikeol. The bald man shook his head, red eyes flooded with tears, mouth frozen open, begging without uttering a word.
The attacker shook Okin by the collar, the blade serrating against the side of Okin's neck, cutting the skin.
"DID HE VOTE FOR SYNODONTIS?"
Okin swallowed in three pieces, feeling the thrust of his adam's apple upwards jut his neck into the hovering blade. Okin and Mikeol-- two of the most powerful among dozens of millions-- stared at each other with wide, bloodshot, teary eyes, and flushed cheeks, both shaking.
"Yes. Yes he did."
Mikeol's two eye sockets and mouth expanded like a python's jaw. His trembling stopped and he became a frozen statue, but in an inhuman state, like every muscle in his body had stretched out. A crystallization of doom.
On command, the soldier slashed backwards. His sword stuck halfways into Mikeol's neck, and then released in an equally sharp motion. Okin jumped like he was the one who had been slashed in the neck-- while Mikeol's head just collapsed to the side, his body limply following the waterfall of blood splattering from his neck to the floor.

"Good to know that you live up to your name, honest Okin," the attacker smiled. He stepped over Okin's prostrated, weeping body. The other Impaliases whimpered as he stepped towards them. Okin heard a sharp yell.
"Now this one!"




Okin charged at the attacker.
* Vovwaq taunts Okin
Vovwaq waved his hand, finger by finger, like a little girl saying goodbye.
* Okin denies Misthiel, says he will not associate with True Light
"What we was against the Virtues. There is no denying that, no justifying it," Okin said.
"It had to be done, and thus was for the Gods," Misthiel said. "What would have happened if he got elected, while contacting foreign interests, foreign interests of Darkness, with a Dark Herald? If he voted to declare that the Deceiver was our God? The Gods ordained that you and I interfered to ensure that would not happen, all by revealing the Darkness from its hiding place. How can you say that is against the Virtues?" Misthiel asked.
"Enough! I have stirred over it enough," Okin said.
* Henard's reveal

"B-but you argued on my side! You were trying to convince the others that he was a deceiver!"
"All a Deception itself, I'm afraid," Henard scowled in shame. "The other Impaliases I was 'convincing' are his agents. They would have never changed their mind-- it was all a ploy to get you to trust my objectivity, which I would use to eventually change your mind."
"I thought you said they really believed-- how could they sanction using such tactics-- such tactics against what we professed to believe?"
Henard sighed. "We do all believe. More than that, we /know/. He has told us the Truth," Henard said. "We /know/ we are fighting Tregale. We /know/ building the Citadel, destroying the threats to Versalism, helps to stop him and the Darkness from taking over and destroying the world."
"How can it be the Truth," Okin shook his head. "If you hide it from the rest of the world, even the most studied Athars? And just who is this /he/ you keep talking about?!"
Henard lowered his head. Out of the shadows, a darkly dressed figure stepped forward just inside the precipice of the candle's flickering sphere.
"Our God of Wisdom."
* Okin and Revictus
Okin's eyes widened. "Olitheon?" the ghostly gasp escaped his lips.
The pale, tall man, lowered himself to Okin's level. He moved in a smooth yet hyper-measured way, as if he was being dragged like an object instead of really walking.
"No," the man finally said, his pale blue eyes-- the same eyes that demanded Wise action to him in the chambers of the Impaliases-- struck into Okin's heart. "I am not Olitheon. I am Revictus."
"But Revictus doesn't look like you. He has long black hair, tanner skin--"
"That was someone else," the stranger said. "I had to paint myself as Olitheon, so I could be him in the Return. I could've lied to you right now, and pretended to be Olitheon, but I thought it'd be better for you to finally hear the Truth."
Okin eyes darted around the periphery of light cast by the candle. This was all too much-- he had been forced into this moment, into this candle light with somehow /another/ stranger, who looked just like his God he knew, who he had to decide whether he was or not.
"Truth /what?/ So first there is someone who looks just like Aredal, and claims to be him, and now you look just like Olitheon, and claim to be Revictus?"


"So what?" Okin sneered. "We are all just accessories, background characters to the main event, to /your/ story?"
"You are the only one saying that," Revictus said.
"You said it over a thousand years by presenting yourselves as our gods, by forcing yourselves as our gods. By building the Citadel," Okin replied.
Revictus' eyes didn't budge an inch. Okin would not mistake the man as thoughtless, but by the mechanicalness of his response, he knew it was a calcified, prepared one. "I created nothing to be worshipped, to make my contemporaries and I objects of worship as an end. I did it all for the safety of the human race."
"I knew you would say that," venom still laced Okin's lips. "But sometimes our thoughts only cast a film of justification. /It is what we do over our lifetimes/-- and you have had multiple to change your ways-- /that shows what we are/."
"/The Four or the Darkness within. Neiman 2 14:25/," both Okin and Revictus muttered the ending together.

"ALL THIS-- IS A LIE! YOU made me, and all my friends, fight a WAR for you! You made me watch a man die, as I spoke the words that killed him! YOU made me almost KILL MYSELF!"
Okin's voice was shaking.
# idk what to put here. would revictus know Okin is a Dark Herald.
