They passed merchants wearing feathery foreign caps,  men and women holding their children with one arm and pottery with the other, and Rothars and Athers, dull expressions inhabiting silver suits and golden robes. Most were heading out of the market district, as it was almost sunset.

Gendro made his best effort to make any of them laugh or smile. “Was there some holiday I missed?” He’d quip to the merchants. “That looks just quite big enough to stuff that little gremlin inside and forget about it,” he joked to one moustached man with a cylinder vase tucked under one arm and a baby tucked under another.

None of them smiled, in fact, some looked offended. Okin was rather embarrassed to have to tug Gendro along like he was *his* child. Thankfully, most didn’t care to identify them.

Okin understood, Gendro was trying to fulfill his Dedication of Joy. But if it wasn’t working, why keep trying? Furthermore, Gendro also had already received his mark of Joy, just as Okin had received his of Truth.

Okin was actually a little relieved when they passed the edge of the market and entered the more rugged residential streets. While it was rather barren here, especially compared to any of the other areas of The Citadel, there were still beggars and extremely low peasants, some wading the streets like zombies. 

In his head, Okin said a prayer to Aleine to bless them, and gave a small thanks for all that he had. He gave a small nod to a thin man with a long face and a longer beard, who looked at them with despair.  The man’s eyes followed them, and soon his bare feet did, too.

While they walked, Gendro pulled his Rothar’s satchel to the front of his body and dug inside. Okin hurried his pace; he wanted to give to these starving men and women, but it could be done *after* they met with the mysterious vagrant.

But Gendro slowed his pace to shake a few nickel steltells out of his coin pouch. Okin couldn’t stop him--- that would just be un-Atherly, and though it was a minor case, he would be interrupting his Rothar from pursuing his Dedication. 

The thin man watched with eyes like a hawk, Okin could sense them even in the consuming darkness. Gendro gave a warm smile and held out the money, motioning with the lamp that it was okay to step closer.

One by one, the man took the coins between his chipped, yellow nails, glancing up at Gendro between each grab. The Rothar just smiled and nodded.

Though his face was so wrinkled and hairy, Okin thought the man smiled back. 

*Perhaps Gendro was more serious about his Dedication than I once assumed,* Okin thought. *Or perhaps you are less,* another voice whispered. Okin clenched his teeth.

The lamp’s warm fire and the shiny steltells drew the eyes of the other vagrants in the area. They drew towards Gendro, who only smiled and got more coins out of his pouch. A small flare struck in Okin. Was *Gendro,* an apathetic jokester, really doing more to further the incomplete Values of his Dedication than Okin?

Three silver steltells fell into the hand of a spindly woman, and Okin instantly snapped out of his foolish rage. What a terrible thought, surely transmitted by the tyrannical Tregale! He would not be *envious* of his own Rothar helping the poor as taught by the Gods!

Okin pushed all of that violent fire out of his chest with a deep exhale. He gave Gendro a pat on the back, and the Rothar quickly turned around and smiled at his Ather.

A crowd of beggars had drawn, but soon enough, the problem fixed itself.  Gendro gave his last steltell to a dirt-faced child.

There was a sea of overlapping thanks, and Gendro and Okin continued on their way. Okin kept peering behind them. Though he could see only a few feet in the dark, thank Aredal, it appeared none followed them.
