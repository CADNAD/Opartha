# The virus

The alien probes spread the virus when they scanned all the living things around it

The longer your body fights the virus before forming anti-bodies determine how strong a Herald is

The first Heralds are hit by the virus, they have no anti-bodies passed from food or parents so they fight the virus for longer making them stronger heralds.

Humans first get the virus from animals and it is spread slowly that way

# The Gems

Gems are all isotopes of the same elements. 

A gem is found in a geode surround by Anti-Gems
