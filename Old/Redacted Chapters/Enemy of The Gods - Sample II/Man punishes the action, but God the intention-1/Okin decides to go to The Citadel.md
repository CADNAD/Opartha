On first sight, there was nothing different of significance from what Gendro had described. The room was completely bright, with several lanterns both inside and outside the cell, so many that it hurt Okin’s eyes at first. The guards had fallen to wounds of a sharp blade, pools of blood surrounding them on the concrete floor. Still, Okin checked for a pulse: many of these guards were Rothars, and many Rothars had Heraldry, and there was no end to the power of Heraldry.

But there was none. The guards had probably both been dead for some time.

Pulling over the first guard’s left arm, Okin turned over the dead man’s palm. There was a small tattoo of a black, four-pointed star, and just below it was a thin yellow triangle pointing down and to the left, which marked it as proof of a Dedication to Aredal, and proof of Bravery. Clasping his hands in front of his chest, Okin said a prayer to his own God, Aredal, the God of Light. He did the same for the second fallen guard, although this time the tattoo was a black triangle intersected by a green circle in the top right corner, which marked Dedication to Intillia and proof of Discipline. Okin closed his eyes again, this time praying to God of the Elements. 

Trying not to cringe from the smell, Okin stepped over the guards and moved towards the cell. The door was swung open, and the lock laid on the floor, if you could still call it a lock. The shackle was completely blown off, and even part of the body looked as if it had been burned away. What remained of the lock was warped and twisted, no longer confined to the shape of the lock. Behind, a hole and been burnt through the wood, singing the wood. 

Burning... this must be the work of a Gas Herald? A very powerful one, then.

“Is it possible that Billy was a Gas Herald?” Okin asked.

“Well, it’s not impossible. But with that other degenerate being a Dark Herald, the odds are low of them both being Heralds.”

*Damian being a Herald doesn’t have anything to do with the chances of Billy being a Gas Herald. But, I don’t have time to debate Gendro on such an insignificant point.* 

Okin pulled open the door with a loud squeak. “Could Damian have mind-controlled the guards into killing each other?”

“No, we kept this room glaringly bright for a reason. He’d be unable to use any of his powers, unless he touched them, but I specifically commanded the guards to stay away from the cell,” Gendro said.

*Right, I forgot*. Sometimes Dark Heraldry was so demonic that Okin thought better to ignore it completely.

But, before Okin continued into the cell, he drew backwards to check the guard’s blades. Nope, no blood. At least one theory was out of the question.

Pushing back into the cell, something caught his eye. There was a circular dark mark on the wall, near the corner of the cell, as if something had been shot there--- something very, very hot.

Crouching down, Okin drew a line in the air from the dark spot to the door of the jail cell. The angle was perfect--- something had tore through the lock, burning a hole through he door, and hitting the back wall. It wasn’t a musket ball, that would have made a crack, not a burning mark. It was either some sort of weird Apathasawian weapon he had never seen--- or Heraldry.

But even more importantly, this mark confirmed Okin’s suspicion--- Billy and Damian had not broken out of jail themselves. This shot, or burst of flame, or whatever it was--- had been fired from the outside of the cell, inward.

Gendro stood awkwardly outside the cell, tapping his foot. Okin stepped outside the cell to face him, his expression determined. “Gendro, someone is helping them. Someone helped them escape,” Okin finally said.

“What makes you say that?” Gendro asked.

“Look,” Okin motioned for Gendro to come inside the cell with him. The Rothar followed, and Okin pointed at the dark spot. “This is some kind of burn mark, and it perfectly lines up with the burn marks on the bars. Someone fired something inward, breaking them out of jail.”

“Herald?” Gendro asked.

Okin nodded. “Most likely.”

Gendro studied Okin’s face as Okin rattled his mind. 

*How could this have happened? It is like I am being punished for some deadly sin. I was only trying be Brave, to make sure that Aredal’s Justice would be delivered, was I not? What could I--*

Okin’s stomach churned as he realized what he had done. He had withheld Truth from those guards regarding the legality of holding the trial in Metheno instead of bringing it to an official Versalist court in Caldoor. His perfect record of Truth was now over.

“What is it? What’s wrong?” Gendro asked. 

“I have told an effective lie,” Okin said, his head drooping. “I have betrayed my Dedication to Aredal, and I don’t deserve to be an Ather.”

Gendro let out a hearty laugh, and Okin stared at him in shock.

“Oh, Okin. When I was assigned to become your Rothar, my commander told me that you had never told a lie in your life. I thought that it was certain that that itself, was a lie. But, whether it was or not, it doesn’t matter,” Gendro said, smiling. “We’re all going to make mistakes. I’m no Ather, but I know that Dedication isn’t about being perfect, because that’s not possible. If it was, then we’d *all* be Gods, and then, well, none of us would be. And besides, isn’t another one of your values Bravery? You’d be betraying that a lot more if you just curled up in a ball and cried.”

*He actually makes a point. I did not purposefully break my Dedication, in fact, I was trying to strengthen it. But whether I was following the values of Justice or not, I have averted its course. I must set things right, no matter how hard it may be. Perhaps Aredal is giving me a chance to redeem myself, to not make the same mistake twice.* 

Okin turned back to Gendro. 

“We’re going to The Citadel.”

“We have to go to The Citadel.”
