Liu stumbled back towards the sheds, towards Iago’s manor. His knee bent as if it going to snap with every step; he wanted to clutch it but his two hands were occupied, holding his burning sides. 

*Are my ribs broken? No, it would hurt more than this.*

He continued to hobble towards the manor, sliding his feet against the dirt path in an effort not to trip. His legs shook; they were going to collapse in only a matter of time, and finally he fell, just as his hand touched where the dirt path became cobble.  

Liu’s ears pricked up at a low, distant rumble that grew ever louder with each passing second. He stood on his tiptoes, looking over the fence. A detachment of imperial cavalry came to a stop outside of Mr. Iago’s manor. Their red banners fluttered in the breeze as a tall, dignified figure stepped off of the stallion at the unit’s head. He wore a long black tunic and matching charcoal pants.

Iago stepped out onto the porch and bowed politely to the inspector.

“Inspector Shi! What a pleasant surprise!” Iago smiled warmly.

“Mr. Iago,” the inspector nodded his head, “How has business on the farm been as of late?”

“Excellent!  The rice especially, has been doing very well with the recent rains, and we’ve had three dozen piglets in the last month! That new farmhand, his work is marvellous! He’s as conscientious as he is intelligent, very much more skillful than the others!” Iago beamed. “My apologies sir, I don’t mean to babble.  What might I do for you today?”

“Just a routine inspection, as always,” Shi smiled forgivingly.  

Iago smiled and gestured out towards the farm, still not noticing the fallen Liu. “Ah, of course. In that case, it’s yours to examine, sir.”

“Thank you Mr. Iago. Do follow along with us, in case any questions were to arise.” The inspector started off through the open gate into the property, followed by Iago.

“Is it just me, Mr. Iago, or was this cobbled path only dirt before?”

“Ah yes, inspector! This path was freshly cobbled just last week. You should’ve seen those plans our new farmhand drew out! You know me, I’m no man of numbers but that Liu, he’s something else! Calculating the costs, the numbers of stones and how they tessellate together, so on and so forth. Incredible, isn’t it?”

Liu tried to push himself off the floor, but it was no use. His forearms trembled before collapsing inwards.

“These stones fit so perfectly together, and it all seems to be in order with imperial bylaws. Excellent work.”  

“Yes, he also had an unusually comprehensive knowledge of the codes and bylaws, down to the smallest substatutes.”

“Incredible indeed, Mr. Iago. Everything is looking quite excellent--tell me, how are profits this season?”

“Profits? Why, they’re splendid! We’re raking in almost twice as much silver as last season!” Iago shouted. “Ever since Liu took over as my accountant, our farm’s checkbook is nothing but smooth sailing!”

Liu tried to call out for Iago, but as he opened his mouth, there was nothing but a faint wheeze, far too quiet for either of the men to hear.

“Marvellous! Now, I see you’ve repainted all of the sheds, so I assume that there is ample extra produce this season!”

“Indeed there is! Liu’s completely changed everything, I don’t even know what he’s--”

“By Aredal, how does he have the time for all this?”

“His time management--that’s the most amazing thing about the young man.  He plans out everything to the minute, and everything is done precisely and effectively!”

Liu attempted one last rise, but all he could do was roll himself on his back.

“Could I perhaps- meet this Liu?” Shi asked, turning to Iago.

“Well yes, of course! That is quite strange, I actually asked him to return back to the manor...,” Iago scratched his chin as he turned towards the cobble path, his eyes falling upon Liu’s fallen body.

Liu looked up at the bright blue sky, his eyelids fluttering the sun’s blinding glare in and out of view. The glare was covered by Iago, who crouched over him, his expression growing more and more horrified.

“Liu! What happened? Are you okay?” Iago shouted, horrified. Another worried face came into view over Liu, a thin, distinguished face. 

“I apologize for the unprofessionalism, but please, help me bring him inside!” Iago said to Shi. The inspector nodded, and then Liu felt two pairs of arms slide under his back, carrying him in the air. His neck cocked back in exhaustion, he continued wheezing until they placed him down on a chair inside Iago’s manor.

Resting his eyes, Liu heard rushed footsteps, seeing the concerned face of Iago as he opened them again. 

“Here. Drink,” Iago said, handing Liu a glass of water. Liu accepted gratefully, and chugged down the glass.

“I am terribly sorry Shi, but I need to attend to Liu for a while. I will show you everything else after I am sure he is okay.”

Shi, laying ontop of a leather couch, waved a dismissive hand. “I know you, Iago. You already showed me the books, and this is urgent. We can just chat in here for a little while,” Shi smiled.

That is rather illogical. While there is nothing criminal on Iago’s farm, what if there was? It would have gone unseen due to this official’s sloth.

Iago smiled back. “I’ll get you something to drink, Shi?” 

“Some wine would be excellent,” Shi replied. Iago nodded cheerfully, and opened rushed to a cupboard to get a bottle of wine.

“Is that a Terdoo set I see?” Shi asked, gesturing to . “I didn’t know you played, Iago.”

Iago popped open the bottle of wine with a corkscrew and poured it into an ornate glass. “Oh yes, many years ago. I haven’t touched it for so long, though, a beginner could probably beat me.”

Shi chuckled. “I won’t lie, I am quite the Terdoo challenger, but I wouldn’t mind playing a friendly game. How about it?”

Iago shook his head. “No, I don’t exactly feel like getting embarrassingly outmatched today.” “Ah, alright,” Shi sighed. “What about you Liu? Would you like to play a game of Terdoo?”

“Shi, come on, the boy not in shape to play a game right now,” Iago said, handing Shi the glass of wine.

Liu raised his hand. “Actually, I’ve never played the game, but I want to try, if you don’t mind, Mr. Iago,” he croaked.

Iago looked with concern eyes to Liu. “Well, if both of you’d like to, by all means.” He walked over to the corner of the room to grab the 

Shi smiled excitedly, as Iago placed the down on the table in between the two players. 

“It is obvious that Liu does not exactly fit in here.” Shi smiled, “and while your farm is a marvellous place, Mr. Iago, perhaps he is destined for something more.”

Sighing deeply, Iago shook his head. “I know it to be true. I made a promise a long time ago I’d take care of the boy, but it’s obvious- this isn’t the right place for him.”

“Perhaps there are other ways you can take care of him,” Shi said, prompting an interested look from Iago. “Since Delmia has officially joined the Empire, finally, might I add, that means that all Imperial applications for government positions and education are open to Delmian citizens. I’m sure they’d gobble up a diligent mind like Liu.”

Iago looked to Liu’s battered face, and then nodded. “You’re proposing that I sponsor Liu?”

Shi nodded. “Imperial education can be expensive, and I know that taking Liu away from the farm will lower efficiency, so I will give half towards any of the cost.”

“Really? What’s in it for you?” Iago asked with a raised eyebrow. 

“Just a charitable act to nurture a talented mind,” Shi said, and Iago’s lips curled in amused disbelief.

“Well, how do you feel about that, Liu? A government education, paid by two very generous benefactors?” Shi smiled at Iago’s question.

Despite their joking, the offer was more then generous. Liu honestly believed he was little undeserving of Iago’s kindness, and of the generosity of this inspector, regardless of his ulterior motives. 

“That sounds very good, Mr. Iago. If you are okay with it, of course,” he finally said.

“Of course, Liu. The work you’ve done for me--- equivalent to years of optimization--- will more than pay off the student fees. I’d be delighted to sponsor any endeavour you desire,” Iago smiled his warm, endearing smile.  “Who knows, maybe you’ll come back to the farm and have even more knowledge to share.”

“Well, now that we’ve gotten that out of the way,” Shi took a sip of wine, “Do you know what path of education you’d be interested in?”

Liu looked up and to the right, deep in thought. He wasn’t so sure which education path, and therefore career path, he’d be interested in. This had all come so unexpectedly, it was only five weeks ago that he thought he was lucky to be shovelling horse shit.

*Well, all I know is that I want to support the nation in the greatest capacity I can.*

“What government positions are the highest in demand right now?” Liu asked.

“It would without a doubt be military officers. There aren’t many Delmians who want to support the Empire, least of all in the military,” Shi replied.

“Military it is, then,” Liu said. He attempted a smile, but his lip was so swollen and he was in such pain it probably looked more like a grimace.

“Very, very good choice,” Shi said, exhaling pleasurably as he finished his wine, placing the glass down on the table. “The Empire had built a school to train those looking to become officers of the Imperial army, although those are few and far between here in Delmia. Although, since now the Delmian nation is officially part of the Empire, it is probable there will be a rise in recruitment.” 

Shi stood up, turning to Iago. “Thank you very much for your generous hospitality, Iago, as always. I will get my half of the payment, it should be around seven hundred fifty Imperial zhens, which is...,” Shi looked up to the roof as he did the calculations in his head.

“Ninety Six-Gold Sankei, and four Silver Sankei,” Liu interjected.  

“Thank you, Liu," Shi replied. “I will then meet back here to fetch Liu on the morrow, if that works?” Shi asked, raising an eyebrow.

“If it is fine with Mr. Iago, I would like to get started as soon as possible,” Liu said. Smiling, Iago nodded.

“Good,” Shi said, walking towards the door. “It was a pleasure as always, Iago,” Shi shook his the old man's hand, and then left the manor; Liu could hear the horses gallop off. 

After closing the door shut, Iago knelt down next to Liu, his eyes were washed over with concern, and he turned Liu’s face to look at the large bruise under his eye.

“Liu, are you sure you want to do this? I’m not sure that the military will treat you any better than the other farmhands,” Iago said. “If you do stay, I’ll make sure this never happens again.”

“It is alright, Mr. Iago. I would like to go to the military academy if that is okay with you,” Liu croaked.

The happy wrinkles next to Iago’s eyes appeared once again as he patted Liu on the knee. “They would be so proud of you. It has just been over a month, and already, I’m so proud of you.”

“Thank you, Mr. Iago,” Liu said.

“Alright,” Iago said, standing up. “Go gather all your belongings and get some rest, knowing Shi, he will arrive early tomorrow morning. I know you aren’t fond of working with the animals, but you will be taking one of my horses to the military academy, as a gift.”

“Thank you again, Mr. Iago,” Liu said stoically.
