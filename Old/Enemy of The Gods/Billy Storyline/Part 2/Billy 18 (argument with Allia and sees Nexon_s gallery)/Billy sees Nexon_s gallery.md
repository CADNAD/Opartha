Once again, Billy couldn’t catch of a wink of sleep. He was lying awake long before the pirates hit the hay, and was lying awake long after. The noise and swaying was hard enough, but he kept having to rap his head whenever he started replaying his argument with Allia, his after-chat with Benjy, and whether he was really in the right or not. How did anyone manage to get rest on these seas?

The pirates had made it pretty clear that they didn’t give a shit if he wandered around the ship, so he did just that. A vessel in his head throbbed just to maintain his normal motor function. 

The deck was still flooded with spillage of soup and booze, despite being actually clean upon their arrival, which was odd. If their ‘prisoners’ didn’t clean the ship, who did?

His mouth salivated at the thought of alcohol. For some reason, he’d actually simmered down on the drinking after starting training at the Monastery, before being given those beers by Kiatus. Now, the cravings were like a thick aura sprouting from his mind, blocking all his senses.

He didn’t dare steal from these pirates though, did he? They were rather hospitable now, but that could all be ruined, like it had back at the Order. And stealing booze was actually a reasonable thing to get mad about.

He couldn’t help it, though; the cravings poked at his skin like needles, his taste buds begged and whatever was in his mind forced desire upon his being, fueled further by the anger that boiled whenever he thought of Allia’s words. Maybe he could find one bottle, unguarded, and quickly chug it in the darkness? 

He creaked around the ship, opening up doors and trapdoors he hadn’t explored before. It seemed that they didn’t store much on this ship; he only found barrels of gunpowder and weapons.

Finally making his way to the back of the boat, he latched open a double trapdoor he hadn’t even seen since arriving. It opened up to a set of spaced, wooden steps. They creaked under his worn, wet boots.

There was a twin door just in front of the bottom steps, but something else caught Billy’s eye first. Behind the holed-out staircase, torches illuminated a magnificent display.\[ Is this behind as in under?\]

Several maps---a few as long as he was tall--- were plastered along the walls of the room. Billy couldn’t catch all the details, but they were numerous. Some maps were colourful and cartoonish, while others were flat and symbolic. 

And the walls--- they weren’t made of wood, as the majority of the ship was. They looked to be some sort of darkened steel which lined the entire surface area of the room. Even the twin doors appeared to be made of this metallic ingredient.

That was just the walls, though. Protruding from the floor were several box-like stands with a glass encasement on top, protecting its contents. There were long swords, teeth, fossils, gems, golden ornaments, and even encased books.

Billy glossed his hands over the glass, staring at an orange feather the size of his arm. He pulled his arm back, looking at the golden watch on his wrist. His father had been a collector and a worldly man, but never had anything like *this.* His lip quivered. What would his father’s reaction be like to a collection like this one? 

There was a muttering, and Billy flinched. It was coming from behind the closed doors at the bottom of the staircase.

The murmuring grew into audible shouting, and Billy recognized the voice---it was the Captain’s.

“No! We can’t! It’s too risky!” The doors shook and the floor below Billy’s feet trembled.

Billy crouched down and snuck towards the steps. 

“What if he hurts him?” Kiatus whimpered from behind the doors.

Billy took another step and prepared to turn on his heel and sprint up the stairs, loading the pressure on his back leg.

The boards creaked under his weight.

The doors smashed open, and a violent gust knocked Billy to the ground. He turned onto his back, scrambling backwards with his arms.

Kiatus twitched above him, moving so fast and jaggedly that it appeared he was teleporting around the room. He finally stilled, clutching his temples with both hands. His hair stood up on all ends, and his entire body convulsed with such speed that it looked like a fuzzy drawing.

“Ah,” Kiatus said, his bulged, veiny eyes meeting a terrified Billy on the ground. “Billy. What are you doing down here?’

Billy’s crumpled his body to the floor, turning his head away. “I-I---“

“Couldn’t sleep, I’m guessing? I would tell you it gets better, but truth be told, I haven’t had a good night’s rest in who knows how long,” Kiatus gave a crooked smile.

“I---I’m sorry,” Billy said, heart running at a thousand miles. “For intruding on your space. I didn’t know.”

“Oh, nothing to apologize for. To be honest, I wish more of them were interested in this sort of stuff,” Kiatus motioned a twitching hand to the gallery of artifacts.

“Oh---yes. It is---magnificent,” Billy said. 

Kiatus smiled, then offered a clean hand to Billy and pulled him back on his feet. He then began to stroll around the glass displays. Billy’s breath slowed and he lingered behind the Captain.

“Tell me, Billy. Do you have a taste for adventure?” Kiatus stopped at a jagged, massive tooth the size of a grown man’s hand.

“Well, uhm. To be honest--- not really,” Billy said, gazing over Kiatus’ shoulder.

“Well then why would you be sailing over the Leviathi Strait into Krinosas, of all places?” Kiatus asked, trembling hands clasped in front of his chest.

Billy’s stomach dropped at the question. ”Well--- I didn’t even want to go. The other three, they want to go on some crazy mission to collect some artifact or something.” He looked back to the Captain, whose expression remained unchanged.\[ I would say to add a tell here, but that might be promising something too big\]

“Well, I enjoy expedition and collecting artifacts myself. Yes, yes, I quite enjoy it,” Kiatus said, his eyes and voice not even directing anywhere, as if he was talking to himself.

“I-I didn’t really want to go, though. I just want to protect my brother,” Billy sighed. “And I wanted to finally see someone really important to me, but I think that option’s pretty much out the window now.”

Kiatus’ neck jerked from the tooth, his bulged eyes met Billy’s face.

“Protect your brother?”

Billy’s heart pounded so loud, he wouldn’t be surprised if Kiatus could hear it. He opened his mouth to speak, the heavy air from his breath creating a strain with every word.

“Y-Y-Yes---“

“That is the most honourable of all causes,” Kiatus’ eyes returned to the pearly tooth. “A brotherly bond, the true, unconditional connection of family,” Kiatus said, watery pupils shining with torchlight. “Yes, yes, the brotherly bond. The most honourable of causes.”

Billy nodded and his feet shuffled away from Kiatus, who still stared in a mindless trance for several seconds. Suddenly, Kiatus snap-turned, hands clutching Billy’s shoulders. Billy’s body convulsed at the sudden motion.

“Make sure that you always protect him. That you never let him go,” Kiatus said.

Billy’s chest fell and he exhaled, releasing the pent-up air and relaxing his shoulders. 

“Yes, I will,” he said. “I’ll always protect him, as I always have.”

Kiatus smiled and tears flooded out of the corners of his shimmering green eyes. 

“Good, good,” he loosened his grip, patting Billy’s shoulder.

“Do you think, though,” Billy squirmed. “Do you think maybe, as strange as it may sound, that protecting him involves giving him the freedom to explore the world for himself? Like--- like adventure, even?”

Billy turned back to Kiatus, who now stared at the wall, one hand on his chin. 

“Why...yes. It is merely about strengthening the connection between you and him. Making sure that, no matter what, nothing ever comes between you two.”

The shimmering fire in those emerald eyes was ever-present, just as it was when Billy had first met Kiatus. Perhaps it was the eternal flame of adventure, as the Captain himself suggested, but there was something deeper beneath it too, now, as he spoke. An almost emptiness, as if he was reading a manuscript that’d he repeated every day since childhood.

“You know, Billy, you have to fight for what you want before it’s too late,” Kiatus nodded as if he was a bystander agreeing with his own point. “You never know when the opportunity will disappear.”

Billy raised an eyebrow. “You, uh, you d0n’t look very old. I’m sure whatever you’re talking about, you’ll have another chance.”

“I can make Time come to a near stop. To me, it feels like I’ve lived a thousand lifetimes,” Kiatus shook his head and smiled weakly. “And still, there are some things that I’ve only had one chance at.”

Billy’s breathing stopped, and his gaze drew away from Kiatus and to the torches on the wall. The bright, burning torches. 

*One chance.*

His body was there again---he had the trembling, outstretched hands and quivering lips of a little boy. The cold metal felt dreadful and alien in his hands, and then it was gone. It came with a drop of a body---and a dark figure, still hidden by the fog of his own mind. 

The figure turned, and his little head turned away, eyes shuttering close.

Billy pulled back to reality, his own eyes meeting with Kiatus’ again.

“But what if you could---what if you could have another?” he asked. “Another chance to do what you should’ve.”

“Then I’d do it, no matter the cost, no matter what it takes,” Kiatus narrowed his brows. “There is nothing---nothing quite like regret.”

Kiatus removed his hands from Billy. His formerly determined eyes widened, and he stumbled backwards. In a blur, he appeared in the corner of the room, his back curled up in a ball.

“But it wasn’t my choice. If only they didn’t fight. If only they weren’t so power-hungry and controlling. It was not me, it was not me,” he murmured.

What was up with this crazy Captain? He had actually been *overly* nice, considering they were technically prisoners, but he must’ve been hiding *something*---powerful people with a shiny exterior always were. Just like how the Monastery was hiding their psycho beliefs, well, *hiding* might’ve been a stretch. The thing is, while this guy was obviously *powerful*--- he was a *pirate*, so besides being good-looking, there wasn’t much of that shiny exterior. And strangest of all, Billy didn’t have that feeling of dread in his gut that usually came up when dealing with manipulators.

Kiatus blurred through the room, and an in an instant he stood before Billy with a wide smile. “I am sorry, Billy. I should really try to get some sleep. Maybe you can try that fool’s errand as well,” he chuckled. “I will see you tomorrow, my friend.”

Billy nodded---and returned a smile. The Captain dashed off, slamming the double doors to his room shut behind him. Billy went back up the stairs, whistling as he did so. It was still black out, but there wasn’t much use in trying to get some shuteye. He instead creaked open the door to the dorm where Benjamin and the rest of them slept.

The choir of snores covered up his footsteps as he looked around the multitude of bunks for his friend. Finally spotting the massive, dark-skinned man on a bottom bunk, Billy crouched down beside the bed, gently tapping his friend’s shoulder.

“Sorry to wake ya, Benjy,” Billy said, his friend fluttering open an eye. 

“You were right, Benjy. As always. I can’t believe it was that crazy captain of all people that made me see. I *do* need to fight for more than just survival. I have to fight for---I don’t know, making sure that the world is fair, that people get what they deserve.”

Benjamin groaned and rubbed his face.

“So... Justice?” He asked.

“Yes,” the Light flashed in Billy’s eyes again, followed by the screams and burning, the drop of metal on the ground, and the hurried footsteps of a child. “Justice.”
