The glimmer in Kiatus’ eyes had faded, and he looked away from the scene, off into the horizon of the Strait, like he was deep in thought. The Light in Allia’s veins wained and Benjamin’s stance fell limp. Billy glanced back and forth from the Captain to his hostage brother, a desperate plea in his eyes.

Kiatus’ eyes finally met his, and Billy waved his clasped hands in a desperate beg. The Captain’s lips pursed, and he stared at Damian being choked at gunpoint by Jerel.

“You know, I don’t like to operate on ego, but part of me is a little bit stricken that you just come on my ship making demands,” Kiatus said.

“You’ll get your payment,” Jerel hissed, tightening his arm around Damian’s chest. “I just need to make sure these prisoners don’t somehow weasel their way out of this again.”

Kiatus glimpsed back to Billy, and then to his struggling brother. 

“Remind me,” Kiatus said. “Where did you guys say you came from again?”

“We’re---,” Jerel took his gun arm and hit Damian in the stomach which stopped the squirming. “From the Tsuman Monastery.”

“Ah,” Kiatus’ lips curled into a slight smile. “Tsuman.”

Jerel’s eyebrows narrowed, and he clutched a nearly knocked-out Damian to his chest before extending his gun arm at the Captain and firing.

The deafening bang silenced the gust of wind.

Before Billy could even blink, Jerel, Evelyn, and the other intruder were knelt on the deck with their hands tied behind their backs. The barrel of Jerel’s Edgar 38 lay next to him, still smoking. And in his arms, Kiatus carried a Damian who looked like he’d just gotten up from a long nap. The Captain smiled at Billy and leaned one arm down to let Damian slide off onto his feet. He kicked away the revolver from a still wide-eyed Jerel to one of his pirates.

Billy snatched the gun he had set down and holstered it before embracing Damian. The Crystal shuddered in his pocket, and he felt Time on his side again.

“You alright?” He let his brother lean on him, the boy was still hacking a bit.

“Yeah, I’ll be good. I can’t believe I let him sneak up on me,” Damian replied, stabilizing himself.

“He’s a slimy bastard, that’s what he is,” Billy glared at Jerel, who just stared down with empty eyes.

The two other captured Heralds squirmed and tried to control the hands tied behind their backs. Little arcs of water tried to flow up from the rushing waters but inevitably crashed back down, and the now dropped cannonballs pushed to the side of the deck Evelyn’s tied hands were pointing but didn’t lift an inch.

“Don’t even try it,” Kiatus smiled over them as his crew drew their guns and swords. The Heralds froze and hid their hands.

“Take whoever’s on board,” Kiatus lifted his chin to the starboard side of the ship, where a smaller boat identical to the one Billy had used to escape the Monastery drifted alongside Kiatus’ flagship. “And take the ship, too. It’ll be fun to have something so versatile and unique in my armada.”

“You’ll need a Dark Herald to bond it so fast,” Jerel said.

Kiatus turned and grinned down at Jerel. “I’m not stupid, my friend. I’ve worked with a Ytternu before. I just never really thought about mixing air and sea, until now. Yunos here is an *expert* at calming and connecting with animals.” The Captain wrapped an arm around a short man with a head that was way too small for his plump, pear-shaped body.

“Here,” Kiatus opened his dark jacket and pulled out a mass of rope that hung within it. He handed it to the man and motioned for three others behind him to follow. “Wrap ‘em up and bring ‘em down here. Then stay on board and get the feel for the thing. Who knows, maybe I’ll make ya a lieutenant and you’ll have the first flying ship in our fleet.”

The Captain beamed, and patted a now wide-eyed Yunos on the back. The four pirates ran and jumped onto the flying ship hovering just next to them.

“Sir,” Jerel said. “I apologize for making such an intrusion on your ship. It was very rude and uncharacteristic of me. I hope---“

“Please shut up. Calwin!” Kiatus shouted. “Release the anchor. Men, prepare to set sail and head back east into the centre of the Strait.”

The men saluted and nodded, and sprinted off to their duties. The sails opened and enlarged, flapping against the wind, which was only outshined by the churn of the metal chain being reeled in.

“Where---where are we going?” Jerel asked.

“You really don’t listen, do you?” Kiatus shook his head. “We’re going to the centre of the Strait.”

Jerel shook. “Wh-what’s in the centre of the Strait?” 

“Boss!” One of the men waved from the rail of Jerel’s ship. “There was only one guy on board, piloting the ship. Yunos wrestled control from him, and seems to be flying this thing alright. You want us to bring him down?”

Kiatus nodded, and the flying vessel lowered so that it’s bottom splashed against the waves. Two large men reached over the side of the ship and threw over a tied-up prisoner onto the deck. The man slammed onto the ground back-first with a muffled groan through his scarf.

The man hoisted himself off the ground, almost falling off the ship as he tried to balance himself with no arms. The scarf slid off his wide face.

Billy’s jaw dropped, and both Damian and Allia had a look of horror. Bundled up in a heavy woolen coats, Avador  scanned the ship, a matched terror in his eyes.

“C’mon,” a large, bald pirate pushed Avador towards the front of the ship where the other prisoners, well, real prisoners, lay.

“Alright,” Kiatus waved to the men on the flying vessel. “Let us be off! I will go to direct the other ships. Protect the prisoners. They will serve a very important role. A gift that cannot be replicated.”

The pirates nodded and saluted their captain, who whizzed off over the side of the ship.

Billy, Damian, Benjamin, and Allia all stood in the centre of the boat. They exchanged awkward glances, each taking a second to wipe their sweaty faces. Damian took a step toward the front of the ship, and both Allia and Billy stopped him with a hand on each shoulder. 

Billy glanced to Allia. There was still a fiery dislike in her eyes before she looked away.

“Don’t,” Allia turned Damian away from Avador. “We can’t let them know that he helped us.”

Damian nodded, and all of their attentions were brought to the billowing sails which were blasted by the draft. Beneath the masts, two men stood with outstretched hands which redirected the wind’s path. The sails swivelled, and the ship began to turn around into the centre of the Strait, facing the bows of the rest of Kiatus’ armada.

“Good, good!” Both Billy and Damian jumped back, no one had realized that Kiatus had returned and was standing right next to them as he shouted at his crew. “Follow the waves! It will be difficult, but we need to sail into rougher waters than we ever had before! We can do this, men!”

“What?” Allia stepped forward and was met by a smiling Kiatus. “Why would we sail into rougher waters? We’re already in the Leviathi Strait for Forces’ sake!”

“No need to fear, my friend! There is something in the centre of the Strait unlike anything else, which our friends over here have allowed us to finally approach with the necessary keys\[ 2021-05-10, 5:23 PM

Possibly change this \],” Kiatus pointed to the tied-up monks\[ 2021-05-10, 5:23 PM

Decide word for Monasterians\] at the front of the ship. He stared out at the rest of the ships, which were still struggling to turn, and let out a breathy sigh. 

“Well, it looks like not everyone else can follow instructions,” he jumped off into the waters again.

“What are we going to do?” Allia grabbed Billy and Benjamin by the collars, pulling them into a group huddle. 

“What do you mean?” Billy asked. “As far as I can tell, we escaped that one relatively scratch-free.”

“That guy is crazy! Who knows what he’s doing, but you heard what he said, he’s taking us to the centre of the Strait on purpose. How long are we going to survive if we stay with this psycho?” Allia hissed.

“Well, I mean, he’s managed to keep five ships afloat and his crew seems pretty happy,” Billy said. “I’m all for being cautious, but it doesn’t really seem like we have any options but to stay with this guy.”

Allia’s eyes darted to the front of the ship, and she cringed. “Who knows what he’s going to do to them? To *Avador*?”

“I hate to say it,” Billy sighed, “but he decided to come after us. It’s not our---”

The port side of the deck jerked up, and Billy grinded his boots into the ground to prevent himself from sliding. Damian almost fell to the ground, but was caught by Benjamin’s Space Heraldry. There was a rush of wind, and Kiatus slid onto the deck next to them.

“Captain! Captain!” A fat man with a red bandana ran up with raised hands. “The rough waves seem to be rapidly approaching us from the side. We’ve never---,” the boat lurched up again, and this time Billy only caught himself with two palms to the ground. Benjamin, Allia and Damian all reached out arms to each other, preventing themselves from falling. The fat pirate fell backwards, but was caught by Kiatus. “We’ve never experienced waters this rough before, sir. It’s frankly weird this close to the Nairfalkish coast.”

“It’s like it knows,” Kiatus stared at the waters, eyes distant. “It’s like it knows.”

“What *knows*?” Allia shouted, the last word shifting into a high-pitched scream. Billy and the rest of them were drenched by a massive wave, which spilled out over the deck. He bit his tongue from the shocking chill. and flicked the water and hair out of his face as best he could. Everything was still a wet blur. He panicked, looking for his brother. Thankfully, Damian was still by his side. He took the boy’s arm. The group of them sprinted to the side of the ship and all clutched the rail. Billy’s fingers whitened against the railing as he stared out through drenched hair at the violent sea.

A giant arch of moss-coloured scales leapt up among the waves, and a tail as long as five men in the shape of a boomerang splashed into the waters before disappearing underneath. Pure fear spawned from Billy’s stomach and leapt out of his throat.

“What---,” Damian’s eyes were aghast, “---was that?

Kiatus smiled, and that golden tint of adventure shimmered in his emerald eyes.

“Why, my friend, that’s the Leviathi.”
