*I am balancing on the line of evil. I have taken to manipulating an innocent young man--- an innocent young man who is my friend, in the name of uncovering a secret whose legitimacy is still uncertain.

They say he was able to manipulate the minds of any, and that is why he has such a strong grasp even on those which we may see as family. If this is true, please Aredal, I have failed you, I have broken my Dedication, but I beg you--- help me distinguish which thoughts stem from my own mind and the ones are born from the corruption of another.*
