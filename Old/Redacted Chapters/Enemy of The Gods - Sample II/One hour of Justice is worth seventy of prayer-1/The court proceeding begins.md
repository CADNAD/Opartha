The six horses struggled for space, two to each hitchpost was rather cramped. One soldier stood outside, half-heartedly watching the horses. 

*Good, at least they followed my instructions.*

Okin smiled as he admired the church building. It was not extravagant or noteworthy; a tall, symmetrical building made of stone bricks, with one tower rising above the rest of the structure. But this church filled Okin with nostalgia, and he was pleased that it hadn’t been remodelled or renovated.

“I hope you still remember this place,” Okin’s father said.

“Of course I do,” Okin replied with a sly smile. “I did end up becoming an Ather, if you didn’t realize.” Okin’s father chuckled.

The inside, much like the exterior, was simple but pleasant; The arched roof was held up by round stone pillars, which stood symmetrically on each side of the church, as did a row of rectangular windows. The floor was made up of large black and white tiles, exempt the area around the altar, which was dark blue carpet. 

The altar itself was a rectangular table covered by a white silk tablecloth. High up behind it was a large window, although it was not transparent--- the stained glass depicted the God Revictus, God of Travel and Protector of Nomads.

Staring into the shining blue eyes of the artwork, Okin remembered the childlike awe he had of his hometown church. The people believed that the Forces birthed Revictus here in the heart of Metheno, although it definitely wasn’t called Metheno at the time, the explorer Metheno wouldn’t be born for hundreds of years. Still, it mattered little to little Okin, they should’ve called the town Revictus then. 

Okin smiled as the memories flooded back to him. His younger self, despite intending nothing but respect, didn’t see that his proposition would be sacrilegious.

Now is not time for childhood memories, Okin thought. If I slip back into the past, it may come back to bite me. Okin looked around for Billy, but he was nowhere to be seen. He did spot two guards, who were gathered near the front of the church.

“Stay here, father,” Okin commanded, marching his way down the row of pews. His father did as instructed. 

Two guards were conversing with a younger man dressed in an-all white robe, a lower Ather. Noticing him, the guards turned away from the conversation, and soon they all vied for Okin’s command.

Okin ignored them, addressing the young Ather. “I am sorry for the abrupt intrusion. I am High Ather Okin, and I hope to make this trial smooth, yet fair,” Okin reached out his hand from over the pew.

The Ather, a thin-faced man with short, light hair reached forward to shake. “My name is Ather Lissom. It is alright, I have been briefed by these soldiers on the gravity and urgency of the situation. I was just a boy when the tragedy occurred, but I still remember the effects of it deep into my teenage years,” the Ather replied.

Okin nodded. “How many other Athers serve at this church?”

“Just High Ather Minos and I,” Lissom replied.

Okin gave a sharp exhale. He knew it was unlikely there would be more then three Athers as it wasn’t a major Cathedral, but two was just not enough. A Moden Versalist High Court usually had at least five ordains who were High Athers are above.

But Okin had already pulled the switch on this decision, and rerouting the case to Caldoor would just place him under more scrutiny. But two was out of the question- if the Athers disagreed it would be a stalemate, and one was definitely too narrow of an opinion to get any sort of an objective measure. There was only one other option- it was against the rules of Versalist justice, but then again, no one who lived in Metheno was truly impartial to this case.

“Okay. You, High Ather Minos and I will be the judges for this trial. Where might he be right now?”

“He’s in the quarters, praying. I can go get him right now,” the young Ather replied.

“Yes, thank you Ather Lissom. And if there are any (sisters), please ask them to get me the text on High Court Proceedings,” Okin replied, and the young Ather bowed before leaving the conversation. “And where might the defendants and Rothar Gendro be?” Okin asked, turning to the guards.

“Gendro wanted to keep them out of the church until the trial began. That bastard sure does have a wild temper,” the taller guard replied.

“We’re in the house of The Gods,” Okin said. “Try to be a little more reverent.”

“Sorry, Ather,” the guard replied.

High Ather. 

“Go tell Gendro that the trial is ready to begin,” Okin commanded. The soldiers gave an affirmative nod, and then marched down the aisle.

Okin watched the guards pull open the large church doors, and was surprised to see they had already gotten here. The people poured through, they hadn’t had the chance to change out of their black clothing. Almost everyone from the Decadem ceremony was there, more or less.

*Well, at least one part of this trial is orthodox.* Moden Versalist courts were often open to the public, as the ordain believed that ‘only the likes of Tregale and Deionis hide in the shadows.’

Conveniently, the two local Athers also made their way out from the Ather’s quarters just as the people started to fill the pews. High Ather Minos was a tall man with a fuzzy dark gray moustache which was matched by identical bushy eyebrows. He nodded respectfully to Okin. The makeshift trial would proceed without any roadblocks.

The church had ample room, so the attendees spread themselves apart, most sitting near the front but leaving space in the pews, only couples and friends sat in groups. Something caught Okin’s eyes a few rows back; there was a petite lady had not taken off her black veil. Normally any type of headdress inside a church would be seen as quite disrespectful, and the Half Decadem ceremony was long over, so what reason did she have to keep it on? He examined the lady closer, the viel blurred her features slightly, but it was still see-through. 

As he focused his eyes, he could see that the women had ivory skin and slanted eyes: indicative of a Beisanian native. 

A Beisanian woman who knew Lionos well enough to attend his Decadem? That’s unexpected, but it did explain her ignorance of the customs.

Okin shook his head. He didn’t have time to ponder the possibilities of Lionos’s former relationships. He had to focus on the here and now: the trial.

Minos and Lissom lined up behind the altar, and Okin followed suit. Three wooden chairs had been placed down behind the altar for this unexpected event. 

Staring directly down the aisle, Okin watched as the double church doors swung open, and for the first time he could look at his old friends without scrutiny, and all the eyes in the room did the same. Billy had been stripped of his hat and his jacket, and his eyes burned, firing towards the three judges. 

And the trial began.
