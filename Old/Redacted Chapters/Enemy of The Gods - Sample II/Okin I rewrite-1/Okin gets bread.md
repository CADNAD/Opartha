High Ather Okin lifted the ends of his white robes as he came down onto the perfect walkway. He looked down to admire the tiles, uniform in being smooth and well-paved, but every inch unique in pattern and shape. He walked this path every day, yet still found some novel beauty on each occasion. The craftsmen of Olitheon had taught the people of Ariska well.

“Good morning, Ather Okin!” Okin turned his head to see a warm, plush red face wave to him from behind a prim evergreen bush. There was a small dark mark that blurred on the man’s hand as he waved.

“Good morning, Mr. Panlo!” Okin smiled and shielded his forehead from the sun to see the man. He stood on his toes and to get a better view at the inviting bed of violets and roses behind the evenly cut rows of grass. “As always, you’ve seemed somehow make this already stunning garden more and more beautiful.”

“It’s easy to spend hours outside in the garden with weather like this,” Mr. Panlo beamed. “I thank Nexon for this Joyful day and Intillia for the plentiful bounties of the earth.”

“That proclamation could never be expressed enough, though it is obvious that through it and the wonderful work you do to light up all of us that your Dedication to Joy and Gratitude is exceptional,” Okin smiled.

The already rosy man’s cheeks reddened further, and he nodded with a wide smile. “Thank you, High Ather Okin, thank you!” He shouted to the winds.

Okin returned an encouraging nod and continued his stroll down the luscious garden and around the small but lively fountain that was filled by crystal clear waters from the river that traveled through the town. He had never in his many years serving here ever seen the fountain stop; like the town, it was a perpetual force of simple, heartfelt life.

He turned down the cobble path and walked on the bridge which stretched over the flowing stream that ran through the adjacent water wheel. 

Okin peered through the oval window and smiled when his eyes met the woman inside who wore a long white apron. He sauntered through the round door with a wide smile on his face.

“High Ather Okin!” The woman shimmied past a counter lined with baskets of pastries, one in her hands. “I’ve got yours right here!”

“Thank you, Mrs. Arlenes!” Okin bowed his head before accepting the basket of bread. He placed it down on the ground and reached over his shoulder for his leather satchel. 

“No, no, no, no,” Mrs. Arlenes reached her hand over the open sack. “No charge today, Ather. You deserve it.”

Okin smiled, but *Values 4:12:38* instantly popped into his head: *No man truly of Justice should use his authority or place above others to attain anything unfairly.* 

“That would not be Just,” Okin said, continuing to fish in the satchel for his coin pouch. “You have worked tirelessly to make bread which I enjoy very much. Everyone else pays a fair price, so will I.”

“Ugh,” Mrs. Arlenes rolled her eyes but showed a slight smile. “How am I supposed to express my Gratitude and Humility when you turn down all my gifts?”

Okin held out the silver coins on his hand, and she shook her head as she plucked them off, revealing the black four-pointed star and single golden triangle on his palm.

“You know what isn’t just,” Mrs. Arlenes hoisted up the basket for Okin. “The fact that you aren’t an--- Impalias or something already, making decisions in The Citadel. And---,” her green eyes stopped over his now-turned over hand. “That they haven’t given you your Dedication in the other two.”

Okin’s jaw flinched, but soon after he gave a small smile. 

“I am sorry, but I have to disagree. I really never have shown my Dedication to Justice and Bravery. And being truly honest, I love it here.”

“Bah!” Mrs. Arlenes waved her hand dismissively. “You’ve shown it to me just now. It’s quite Brave turning down a gift from a baker.” They both chuckled. “And plus, don’t you deserve some special recognition or something? Having never told a lie and all that?\[ comma, 2021-05-20 3:08 PM

Maybe a bit awkward\]”

“I get the recognition I deserve, and Aredal himself will judge my Dedication when I have passed. I do not deserve that which I have not proven,” Okin said. “And I would love to go back to The Citadel, of course. But staying there? I don’t really know,” his soft smile returned as he met her eyes. “But I do know that there are a multitude of things I would miss about this town, one of the foremost being this delicious bread.”

“Well, if you ever decide to accept it as a gift, it is yours,” Mrs. Arlenes scramble back behind the counter while dusting off her hands. “Have a blessed day now, Ather.”

“So may you, Mrs. Arlenes,” he bowed his head again, and taking the basket in his hands, waved back to her as he left.
