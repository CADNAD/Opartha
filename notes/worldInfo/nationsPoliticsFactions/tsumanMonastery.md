## Beliefs:

### Reincarnation

- *Life is but a temporary vessel, the soul lives beyond our mortal bonds. To live is but a gift from the forces. To harness the forces is to ensure great power in the next life, to ensure the forces gift you once again with light. - Intillia 10*
  - The more powerful a herald is, the more in tune with the forces they were on
  - If they are powerful enough 
  - Reincarnation is an endless cycle

### Superiority

- *To be touched is to be gifted by the forces. To not be touched is to be unworthy, it is to be weak. To be weak is death.- Intillia 7*
- *The forces carry not love or hate, but favour. To be strong is to be in favour of the forces. Those in favour, but guide the weak to be strong. - Intillia 6*
  - Heralds are superior to all people
  - The stronger you are the better

### Allegiance

- *The monastery is but one path to strength. One may walk many paths, before or after it. To leave behind the gift, and the cultivation of it is sin. But to leave behind this path, to spread the gift is but the path we shall all walk in one life. - Intillia 15*
  - You can leave at any time, but it is discouraged.

# History:

Intillia opened the Monastery around 30 years ago, and Monastery expeditions began to leave to help those around the globe. Intillia was murdered by Deionis during one of these expeditions. The new leader of the Monastery then closed it off. A faction of those who believe in continuing outside expeditions formed and continues them, but they are a minority.
