Okin collapsed onto the bed. After a whole lot of thinking and a lot more searching, he and Gendro had finally found what he thought to be the passage in the Fourth Book that would best match up alongside that history passage on the Tironese.

Okin slid away from the door and left the Rothar to his snores as he stepped out onto the streets of the Citadel.
