Heralds can perfectly change the structure of an element to another allotrope if they 

If a substance is two elements at once.

Heralds act as a conduit for moving elements. Your element can only be moved through that element. Liquid must be moved through liquid. Dual heralds can move either of their Elements through the other. 

When they absorb it starts fro a single point then goes around as a shell around their skin. Once absorbed it can be expelled from any point along the shell. 

The shell gains the property of the stored elements 

Toxic elements will not affect the Herald if in the shell or while being absorbed 

Liquid Heralds are good assassins and are legal in Wreathward
