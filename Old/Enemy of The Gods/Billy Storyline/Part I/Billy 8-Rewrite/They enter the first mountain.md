It appeared there was an entire economy on this legendary creature’s back. Walking along a grassy path, which in itself was amazing, as everything around it was the rough, red stone that Billy could only assume was the skin of the beast, he saw plots of farmland, attended to by several Heralds, some who watered, some who dug and fertilized without touching a single inch of the dirt, merely waving their hands about. There were perfect gaps in the thick smog, only large enough shine light right above the farms. Really far into the distance, there were some small structures, still underneath the clouded roof, which curved to make a wall down the horizon. Besides that, the view was rather consistent, along with the only noise---a distant *woosh* every few steps. The only difference Billy could notice as he drew closer to the mountain was a subtle rise in height. 

“We should probably give them a primer on how to act, shouldn’t we?” Avador asked, breaking the silence of the trip.

“I believe they are all quite well mannered,” Allia replied.

The man gave Allia a stony stare.“You know how anal they can be, don’t you? At least make sure they don’t gawk.” 

Allia released a small sigh, relenting to the man. “I suppose you are right.” She turned to the three men behind her and stopped them in the street. 

“When we go see the Dakungs, you must show them the utmost respect and reverence. I can plead as much as I want, but if they do not see you as amicable, then they will not accept you, and I can do nothing for you.” 

“Wait, what?” Billy took a step in front of his two friends. “I thought you guaranteed us safe housing.” 

She drew her mouth into a thin line, “I don’t suspect you will be rejected. Thus, I was fairly confident in my offer.”

“Farily confident still makes it an cinking lie,” Billy replied.

“If you simply cooperate, then there will be no problem. I promise you.” 

Billy squinted at the girl, face firm. He scanned the older man, who was lounging against a goods stand nearby, then looked back at Allia.

“I swear by the Forces that my promises will be fulfilled. As long as you promise to cooperate as best you can.” *Just bend over and let me use you. Trust me, it’ll be perfectly fine. Just play your part so that I can go about forgetting about you and all the other people I’ve stepped on. Thanks!* That was what she was really saying. But of course she wanted him to shut up and play a part, no one ever cared what he wanted, what he felt. These people were just like the Athers, just like---The Synodontis.

“I’ll try,” he finally said. 

“Alright then, we’ll lead you into Banuro, and like Chowondo Avador, please try to keep your wits about you.” The way Allia and Avador spoke made Billy feel like a child again. What could truly be so amazing as to warrant a warning to its awe and majesty? What made this *Banuro* so great that it would leave the uninitiated a drooling, witless mess? 

“Well, I think that’s about it,” Avador, said directing them to turn at a grassy path. 

They walked along this path for a while, the nearest mountain’s shadow growing closer. At the end, the path itself seemed to meld into the mountain side, blending like the edges of colour in a water-painting.  

Billy opened his mouth to speak, but stopped as Avador began to run his hand along the stone of the mountain’s base. The man rubbed the stone with a fondness, and Billy thought he could hear the man whispering to it. Avador ran his hands along the stone, until both hands found a small depression where they fit. Firmly pressing his palm against it, an entrance way began to open in front of them. The stone retreated into itself, revealing a rounded doorway about two meters high and a meter wide. 

Billy shook his head lightly, processing the events before him. Allia had told him not to gawk, yet he couldn’t help it. He had seen Solid Heralds before, but nothing had ever moved so fast.\[ 2021-04-10, 10:23 AM

“Welcome,” Avador said. “To the first of the inhabitable mountains. Einwa.”
